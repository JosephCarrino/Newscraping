        "content": "A Chinese research ship docked at a southern  port Beijing leases from the government on Tuesday, officials said, despite security concerns raised by India about the vessel's presence in nearby waters.Port workers at Hambantota gave an enthusiastic welcome to the Yuan Wang 5, waving Sri Lanka and China flags, while the ship displayed a large banner reading: \"Hello Sri Lanka.\"However, the ship's arrival appears to have aggravated tensions between New Delhi and Beijing, who have both spent billions of dollars on development and deals with Sri Lanka, an island of 22 million people that sits on a key trading route.The Yuan Wang 5 had originally requested permission to dock at the port last week, but the visit was delayed after concerns were raised about the ship's presence, though India deniedputting any pressure on Colombo.China says the ship is used for scientific research, but the US Defense Department says the ship is under the command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and is capable of tracking satellites and missile launches. On Saturday, Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry said the government had engaged in \"extensive\" consultations with \"all parties concerned\" with a \"view to resolving the matter in a spirit of friendship, mutual trust and constructive dialogue.\"  It said the ship had been given permission to dock on the condition that no scientific research was conducted in Sri Lankan waters.The ship's arrival at the Hambantota port was always going to be controversial -- China leased the port from Sri Lanka in 2017 for 99 years after Colombo failed to pay debts related to the construction of the facility.At the time, the deal raised concerns that it would give China access to a key shipping route, putting it within India's traditional sphere of influence. And the presence of a ship packed with advanced technology has made Sri Lanka's neighbors nervous.According to a US Defense Department report published last year, the vessel is under the command of the PLA's Strategic Support Force (SSF), \"a theater command-level organization established to centralize the PLA's strategic space, cyber, electronic, information, communications, and psychological warfare missions and capabilities.\"\"The SSF also operates Yuan Wang space support ships that track satellite and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches,\" the US report said.Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said New Delhi's concern about the ship's presence in Sri Lanka was likely due to its monitoring capabilities.\"Spying is not her primary mission ... her primary mission is satellite tracking and monitoring PRC rocket launches, telemetry, and satellite status ... but that same capability can and often is employed to monitor other countries' satellite operations, downlinks and missile telemetry,\" he said.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday the ship is conducting scientific research \"in accordance with international law.\"It \"does not affect the security and economic interests of any country, and should not be interfered with by third parties,\" spokesman Wang Wenbin said.The Yuan Wang 5 has become a symbol of  between India and China -- both of which have financially supported Colombo as it experiences its worst financial crisis in decades. India has provided  to Sri Lanka as it suffers food, fuel and medicine shortages, lending $4 billion in credit lines.China is also a major creditor of Sri Lanka, and is vital to Sri Lanka's efforts to restructure its debt to secure a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Relations between India and China have long been tense, though in recent years along their shared Himalayan border has claimed dozens of lives. Meanwhile, India has  in a bid to balance China's increasingly assertive stance in the Indo-Pacific. In October, Washington and New Delhi will hold a joint military exercise less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the disputed India-China border -- further straining ties between the two nuclear-armed powers. In late July, India's Ministry of Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi expressed concern over the Chinese vessel's visit to Sri Lanka, telling reporters the \"government carefully monitors any development having a bearing on India's security and economic interests and takes all necessary measures to safeguard them.\"On August 5, Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the Embassy of China in Colombo deferring Yuan Wang 5's arrival \"until further consultations\" had been made on the matter. Three days later, without naming India, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang said \"the brutal interference\" in Sri Lanka's foreign relations was \"an act of taking advantage of someone when they are in danger, which is against the basic norms of international relations.\" India later rejected claims its concerns were the cause of delay in the ship docking, with Bagchi telling reporters last week, \"Sri Lanka is a sovereign country and makes its own independent decisions.\" On Monday, India demonstrated the strength of its commitment to Sri Lanka, gifting the island nation a reconnaissance aircraft in a ceremony attended by the Sri Lankan President. The gift of an aircraft \"underscores the cooperation\" between the maritime neighbors, India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. Sri Lanka presents the ideal trans-shipment hub for Chinese imports and exports -- and remains \"very strategic to India,\" said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at New Delhi's Centre for Policy Research. Sri Lanka had been \"caught between a rock and a hard place,\" he said, referring to India and China in no particular order.\"The Chinese had put pressure on them. The Indians had put pressure on them. And they cannot afford to lose any help. All countries which are small and economically weak will face these challenges if they are in a tough neighborhood.\"China has for decades invested in Sri Lanka when much of the international community held back. As many Western countries withheld funding to Sri Lanka over alleged human rights abuses during a decades-long civil war, which ended in 2009, China supplied the former Rajapaksa government with economic aid, said Ganeshan Wignaraja, senior research associate at the British think tank, ODI Global.\"Sri Lanka then thought it could use China as a vehicle for infrastructure-led economic development,\" he said. Between 2005 and 2017, China  $15 billion in Sri Lanka, but as the island nation's economic fortunes waned, it struggled to pay back its debt and the countries agreed on the long-term port deal. Wignaraja said by sending the Yuan Wang 5 to Hambantota port, it was testing the boundaries of that deal.\"China was testing the terms of the lease agreement by sending a craft which has satellites on board and has a highly advanced capability,\" Wignaraja said.

It will take them three hours to reach the city center. But each day they are driven by gnawing hunger and the need to feed their children. Their destination is a bakery, one of many in Kabul where crowds of women have started gathering in the late afternoons, patiently waiting for customers who might give them some bread.  \"Sometimes we eat dinner, sometimes we don't,\" Rahmati says. \"The situation has been bad for three years, but this last year was the worst. My husband tried to go to Iran to work but he was deported.\" The United Nations  that nearly half of the country faces acute hunger. According to a May  by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), 43% percent of Afghanistan's population is living on less than one meal a day, with 90% of Afghans surveyed reporting food as their primary need. They're sobering statistics that encapsulate the first year back under Taliban rule, with the nation isolated and increasingly impoverished. As the US and its allies left the country, they imposed sanctions, froze $9 billion in central bank funds, and halted the foreign aid that once constituted nearly 80% of Afghanistan's annual budget. Outside the foreign ministry, a large mural, one of the few written in English, trumpets the Taliban government's official stance: \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan wants positive and peaceful relationships with the world.\"  Yet, after a year of governing, the Taliban has yet to be recognized by a single country in the world, with international funding still largely frozen. One of the main issues for Western countries has been the new government's marginalization of minorities and women, which includes a de facto ban on secondary education for girls. Repeated promises from the Taliban to allow girls to return to school have yet to be honored. In late June, the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, pushed back against international pressure, saying Afghanistan would make its own rules. \"The fact of the matter remains that the United States is trying to find moral justifications for the collective punishment of the people of Afghanistan, by freezing the assets and by levying sanctions on Afghanistan as a whole,\" foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi told CNN Saturday: \"I do not believe that, that any conditions should be stipulated on the release of funds that do not belong to me, that did not belong to the previous administration, that did not belong to the government's before it. This is the collective money of the people of Afghanistan.\" Amid fears of a full-fledged famine last winter, the US -- through the World Bank -- released over $1 billion in aid funding.  \"That's an example of an area where we're going to want to continue to have pragmatic dialogue with the Taliban,\" a senior State Department official told CNN. \"We're going to talk to them about humanitarian aid access, about measures that we believe can enhance the country's macroeconomic stability.\" But a growing chorus of aid workers and economists say it's not enough and that the continued freeze of Afghanistan's funds is having a devastating effect. \"This is a message that no one wants to hear,\" Vicki Aken, the International Rescue Committee's country director in Afghanistan, told CNN. \"These policies are putting women at risk here. In the name of feminist policies, we are seeing women die of hunger.\" According to a senior State Department official, the US is not close to recapitalizing the Afghan central bank. Although there have been discussions on the matter, the official said they still have deep concerns about the assets potentially being diverted to terrorism.\"We do not have confidence that that institution has the safeguards and monitoring in place to manage assets responsibly and inclusively. Needless to say, the Taliban sheltering of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri reinforces the deep concerns we have long had regarding diversion of funds to terrorist groups,\" they said.The Taliban  that al-Zawahiri, who was , was even in the capital, further complicating any efforts to normalize relations with the Taliban. At the markets in Kabul, the stalls are groaning with fresh fruit and produce. The issue, vendors say, is that most people can't afford them.  \"The price of flour has doubled. The price of cooking oil has more than doubled,\" one vendor says. A few yards away, a young boy picks through a dumpster, collecting plastic waste to resell. \"Humanitarian aid only buys time. It doesn't develop, it doesn't increase incomes, it doesn't create jobs,\" says Anthony Cordesman, emeritus chair in strategy at the bipartisan research organization, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Cordesman warns that Afghanistan's overall economic decline didn't begin with the Taliban's return to power, and neither did the country's reliance on foreign aid. \"If we can find ways to negotiate an effective aid process, where we know the money will go to the people, where it will be distributed broadly, where it will not simply support the Taliban government, then these are negotiating initiatives we should pursue as strongly as possible. But building a tissue of lies -- the equivalent of an aid process based on a house of cards -- taking this money, which could go to many other countries, which can use aid effectively, makes no sense.\" As Kabul's nights begin to cool and its days grow shorter, the fear among humanitarian workers is that this winter will be even worse than the last. \"It is not in American interest to see the economy implode,\" the senior State Department official said. \"We acknowledge that the humanitarian crisis remains serious and dire.\"",

        "content": "South Korea plans to become one of the world's top four weapons suppliers, President Yoon Suk Yeol said Wednesday as he addressed reporters in a speech marking his first 100 days in office.\"By entering the world's top four defense exporters after the United States, Russia and France, the (South Korean) defense industry will become a strategic industrialization and a defense powerhouse,\" Yoon said at the presidential office.In 2021, South Korea ranked 10th in the world in arms transfers, according to the authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).    With arms exports valued at $566 million, according to SIPRI's unique trend-indicator value monitoring system, Seoul was well behind last year's No. 4 exporter, Italy, which sold arms worth $1.7 billion. For comparison, US arms transfers were calculated to be $10.6 billion.South Korea has already taken steps to achieve its top four ambitions.  Late last month, it  to supply Poland with almost 1,000 K2 tanks, more than 600 pieces of artillery and dozens of fighter jets.And in February it inked a $1.7 billion deal with Egypt to supply it with K9 self-propelled howitzers and support vehicles.Late last year, South Korea made another massive deal to supply Australia with K9s.If South Korea meets Yoon's goal, it will surpass not only Italy, but regional power China as well as Germany, Spain, Israel and the United Kingdom, according to the SIPRI rankings.\"I believe this is a very ambitious goal,\" said Chun In-Bum, a retired South Korean general turned military analyst.\"South Korea and its arms industry have to do a lot of work,\" he said. Yoon is largely building on initiatives started under his predecessor, Moon Jae-in, whom Yoon succeeded in May.Eunwoo Lee, a former translator at the South Korean Defense Ministry,  said Moon \"changed topography of the nation's military,\" increasing its defense budgets by about 7% a year.At a defense exhibition near Seoul last October, Moon vowed to innovate \"in line with changes in the security environment and technological progress.\"The investments begun by Moon are paying off, analysts say. this week, researchers Peter Lee and Tom Corben of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney said sales like the tanks and warplanes to Poland and howitzers to Australia have already pushed Seoul into the \"defense major league\" with what they called its \"K-arsenal.\"Seoul's military hardware provides a less expensive but extremely capable alternative to Washington's weapons systems and that's something the US should embrace, the University of Sydney researchers said.Those systems include .The homegrown supersonic fighter, which had its first successful test flight in July, is expected to provide a boost of about $18.3 billion to the South Korean arms industry, Yoon said Wednesday.For buyers, the South Korean weapons can be a way to stretch defense budgets.The South Korean K2 tanks, for instance, are comparable to pricey top-of-the-line main battle tanks like the American M1A2 Abrams, said Chun, the former South Korean general.Poland announced earlier this year it would buy 250 Abrams, but US production lines are limited and US military needs come first. The purchase of almost 1,000 Korean K2s allows Warsaw to add significant numbers quicker than it could get new US-made tanks, analysts say.That's good news for US interests even if US defense companies aren't profiting, they say.\"Cast in a strategic light, Seoul's growing ability and willingness to supply advanced capabilities to other US allies should be welcomed, particularly as the Biden administration grapples with the parallel challenges of resourcing military strategies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific while shoring up America's own defense industrial capacity,\" Lee and Corben wrote. Questions have been raised about how close Seoul and Washington really are on key challenges.For instance, after US-China tensions spiked over the visit of  earlier this month, when Pelosi visited South Korea afterward, Yoon did not meet in person with her, opting instead for a phone call. That led to speculation South Korea was trying not to upset China.\"Even if questions remain over the true extent of South Korea's strategic alignment with the United States, Seoul is nevertheless generating strategic effects by arming states facing Chinese and Russian coercion,\" Lee and Corbin wrote.Chun said the recently announced sale of tanks to Poland could bring benefits for the South Korean military, too.The K2 tanks in South Korea's inventory are not as capable as those the Poles will be getting because significant improvements -- including better defenses -- have been made since the K2s were introduced in 2014, he said.\"I hope this is going to be a catalyst for Koreans. We have 2,000 tanks, but if you have legacy tanks, they're not worth a thing. We saw this in Ukraine. We need state of the art tanks to overcome state-of-the-art antitank missiles. I'm hoping that this would be a catalyst for that,\" Chun said.",

Military officials from South Korea and the United States said they were analyzing the launch for further details.After the launch, South Korea's national security adviser held a meeting to assess the security situation and examined the military's preparedness, according to the presidential office. The meeting participants agreed to closely monitor any related movements ahead of joint US-South Korea military drills, planned for early next week, the office added.North Korea is not banned from firing cruise missiles under United Nations sanctions and last did so in January. Unlike ballistic missiles, cruise missiles are propelled by jet engines and stay closer to the ground, making them harder to detect. Most cruise missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads.The launch came before a speech by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to mark , during which he reiterated his willingness to provide North Korea with aid -- if it agreed to end nuclear weapons development and start the process of denuclearization.Yoon also mentioned this \"audacious initiative\" to improve North Korea's economy in exchange for denuclearization in separate remarks earlier this week. He first extended the offer during his inauguration speech in May.North Korea has had a flurry of recent missile tests, with Wednesday's marking the 18th launch this year, according to CNN's count. By comparison, the hermit kingdom conducted only four tests in 2020, and eight in 2021.The last missile launch was on June 5, with eight short-range ballistic missiles -- which South Korea and the US responded to by firing eight more missiles into waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula.Tensions between the two Koreas have been building this year, with US military and intelligence agencies warning that North Korea appears to be preparing for-- which would be its first in five years.South Korea and the US have stepped up their cooperation to counter North Korea's nuclear and missile programs,  that the two countries would resume long-suspended live field training this summer.

        "content": "Chinese planes are firing rods into the sky to bring more rainfall to its crucial Yangtze River, , as swaths of the nation fall into drought and grapple with the worst heat wave on record.Several regions on the Yangtze have launched weather modification programs, but with cloud cover too thin, operations in some drought-ravaged parts of the river's basin have remained on standby.The Ministry of Water Resources said in a notice on Wednesday that drought throughout the Yangtze river basin was \"adversely affecting drinking water security of rural people and livestock, and the growth of crops.\"On Wednesday, central China's Hubei province became the latest to announce it would seed clouds, using silver iodide rods to induce rainfall.The silver iodide rods -- which are typically the size of cigarettes -- are shot into existing clouds to help form ice crystals. The crystals then help the cloud produce more rain, making its moisture content heavier and more likely to be released.Cloud seeding has been in practice since the 1940s and China has the biggest program in the world. It used seeding ahead of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 to ensure dry weather for the event, and the technique can also be used to induce snowfall or to soften hail.At least 4.2 million people in Hubei have been affected by a severe drought since June, Hubei's Provincial Emergency Management Department said Tuesday. More than 150,000 people there have difficulties accessing drinking water, and nearly 400,000 hectares of crops have been damaged because of high temperatures and drought.The Yangtze is just one of many rivers and lakes  and shrinking amid relentless heat and low rainfall, including Lake Mead in the US and the Rhine River in Germany.  These extreme weather conditions have been supercharged by the human-induced climate crisis, driven by burning fossil fuels. Communities often rely on these bodies of water for economic activity and governments are having to intervene with adaptation measures and relief funds, costing huge amounts of money.China is deploying such funds and developing new supply sources to deal with the impacts on crops and livestock. Some livestock has been temporarily relocated to other regions, the Ministry of Finance said earlier this week, adding it would issue 300 million yuan ($44.30 million) in disaster relief.To boost downstream supplies, the Three Gorges Dam, China's biggest hydropower project, will also increase water discharges by 500 million cubic meters over the next 10 days, the Ministry of Water Resources said Tuesday.The heat also forced authorities in the southwestern province of Sichuan -- home to around 84 million people and a key manufacturing hub --  this week to ease a power shortage. China issued its highest red alert heat warning for at least 138 cities and counties across the country on Wednesday, and another 373 were placed under the second-highest orange alert, the Meteorological Administration said. As of Monday, China's heat wave had lasted 64 days, making it the longest in more than six decades, since full records began in 1961, the National Climate Center said in a statement. It also said it was the \"strongest\" on record and warned that it could worsen in the coming days. \"The heat wave this time is prolonged, wide in scope, and strong in extremity,\" the statement read. \"Taken all signs together, the heat wave in China will continue and its intensity will increase.\"The heat wave has also registered the largest number of counties and cities exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) since records began, according to the statement. The number of weather stations recording temperatures of 40C and above has reached 262, also the highest. Eight have hit 44C.Persistently high temperatures are forecast to continue in the Sichuan Basin and large parts of central China until August 26.A \"special case\" of high pressure from the West Pacific subtropical high, stretching across much of Asia, is likely to be the cause of the extreme heat, said Cai Wenju, climate researcher with CSIRO, Australia's national scientific research institute.CNN's Larry Register, Angela Dewan and Laura He contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Nearly a decade after Japan's  nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011,  More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.\"Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,\" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Photographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be \"in conflict\" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.While the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. The  was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team's research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster.",

        "content": "The world has been inching toward fully autonomous cars . In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an  -backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operatorsfor its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin. It also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.\"It's a dream,\" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. \"After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.\"Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. \"We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,\" he said. \"The AI software is better [now.]\"\"From a technical point of view, the car is ready,\" Xiao said. \"It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.\"AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called \"Professor X.\" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.While AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further,  that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.This year, the coronavirus pandemic  for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm,  free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant   also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app. The startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.\"The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,\" he added. \"For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.\"China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a  from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.\"The bar is incredibly high,\" he said. \"It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy.\"",
