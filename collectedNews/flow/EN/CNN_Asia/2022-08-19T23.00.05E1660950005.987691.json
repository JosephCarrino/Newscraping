He has since continued to raise the idea, reiterating the offer this week.In a speech Monday, he said his government would implement a large-scale food program, provide help for power generation, enhance agriculture, and other measures to modernize North Korea's ports, trade routes, hospitals and economy in exchange for denuclearization.But in the KCNA report, Kim Yo Jong rejected the proposal and leveled personal attacks at the South Korean President.\"To think that the plan to barter 'economic cooperation' for our honor, nukes, is the great dream, hope and plan of Yoon, we came to realize that he is really simple and still childish,\" said Kim Yo Jong, according to KCNA. \"We make it clear that we will not sit face to face with him.\"South Korea's Unification Ministry responded on Friday, expressing \"strong regret\" over Kim Yo Jong's \"disrespectful comments.\" It said North Korea had \"distorted our ideas and mentioned its intention to continue nuclear development instead of responding to the audacious initiative,\" adding that such an attitude would not only threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula but worsen North Korea's own economic situation.In the KCNA report, Kim Yo Jong also said South Korea had pinpointed the wrong location for missiles that North Korea launched on Wednesday, and questioned why the South and the United States had not released their analysis of the weapons. The isolated hermit kingdom launched  from the coastal town of Onchon into waters off its west coast on Wednesday, according to the South Korean military.But Kim Yo Jong claimed the test had been conducted from the Kumsong Bridge in Anju city, located in South Pyongan Province, just north of the capital Pyongyang.
