        "content": " rubber-stamp parliament convened this week to pass legislation aimed at turning the country into a \"beautiful and civilized socialist fairyland,\" state media reported Thursday.The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly met for its first session on Wednesday, and adopted laws on landscaping and rural development, state news agency KCNA reported.The two laws will help advance the ruling party's efforts to bring about \"a radical turn in the rural community and its policy on landscaping to achieve a rapid development of the Korean-style socialist rural community and spruce up the country into a beautiful and civilized socialist fairyland,\" KCNA said, citing a deputy's speech to the gathering.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who did not attend the session, has vowed to improve people's livelihoods and boost rural development amid spiralling economic crises caused by self-imposed Covid-19 lockdowns, international sanctions over the country's nuclear weapons programme, and natural disasters.Many of Kim's economic promises have yet to be fulfilled, analysts say, and aid organizations have warned of rampant food shortages and other hardships.According to a report last month by 38 North, a US-based site that monitors North Korea, Kim's vow to rebuild a typhoon-ravaged province in the country's North and transform it into a \"model\" mining community has made little progress.The United States has accused Kim of pouring resources into military projects at the expense of the country's people. It said this week Russia had approached North Korea about buying ammunition, potentially providing a windfall for the cash-strapped government in Pyongyang. Russia said the US report was \"fake.\"",

        "content": "At least 10 people have died and thousands have been displaced after Typhoon Hinnamnor tore through South Korea's southern industrial hubs on Tuesday, authorities said.Seven of the deaths were reported from one submerged parking lot under a residential complex in the country's southeastern port city of Pohang, according to a report from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety on Wednesday. The seven people had become trapped by rising waters while attempting to move their vehicles, according to the ministry report.Local broadcaster YTN showed footage of a wrecked car being pulled out of an underground garage where muddy waters blocked its entrance.Another person died after being buried in a house hit by a landslide in Gyeongju and two people remain missing from the powerful typhoon.The casualties could rise as rescue operations continue, with the military mobilizing amphibious vehicles.The powerful storm hit with wind speeds equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds in excess of 154 kilometers per hour, or a little over 95 miles per hour. The storm made landfall around 4:50 a.m. local time, battering the southeastern industrial cities of Pohang, Gyeongju and Ulsan with strong winds and heavy rain, before leaving the peninsula at around 7:10 a.m. local time, authorities told CNN on Tuesday.Some 2,900 people have been evacuated, mostly in the south of the country, and more than 66,000 homes experienced power outages, with 45% of service restored as of 3 p.m. local time.The typhoon forced hundreds of flight cancellations, suspension of business operations and school closings.South Korean steel-making company POSCO reported a temporary byproduct gas release at its Pohang plant due to a power outage caused by the typhoon.Shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries based in Ulsan said there were no major losses though some parts of its factory were submerged. Some of its ships were sent to the west coast to head off damage and would return on Thursday.A spokesperson for Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering said there were no incidents at its shipyard in nearby Changwon so far, and it halted production on Tuesday morning as planned.Typhoon warnings were mostly lifted across South Korea, but  urged officials to take precautions until the typhoon is completely gone, his spokesperson said.The neighboring  also braced for damage from the typhoon, with leader Kim Jong Un presiding over a two-day meeting on disaster prevention work and releasing water from a dam near its border with South Korea.South Korea has repeatedly urged the North to give notice before releasing water from the dam as it could result in flooding downstream but Pyongyang has remained unresponsive.",

        "content": " has passed a new law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state in a move  says is \"irreversible.\"Kim vowed the country would \"never give up\" its nuclear weapons and said there could be no negotiations on denuclearization as he hailed the passage of the law, North Korean state media reported Friday.The new law also enshrines Pyongyang's right to use preemptive nuclear strikes to protect itself -- updating a previous stance under which it had said it would keep its weapons only until other countries denuclearized and would not use them preemptively against non-nuclear states.Nuclear weapons represent the \"dignity, body, and absolute power of the state,\" Kim said as he welcomed the decision by the country's  -- the Supreme People's Assembly -- to pass the new law in a unanimous vote.\"The adoption of laws and regulations related to the national nuclear force policy is a remarkable event as it's our declaration that we legally acquired war deterrence as a means of national defense,\" Kim said. \"As long as nuclear weapons exist on Earth, and imperialism and the anti-North Korean maneuvers of the US and its followers remain, our road to strengthening our nuclear force will never end.\" The new law also bans the sharing of nuclear technology with other countries. It comes amid rising regional tensions over North Korea's expansion of its nuclear weapons and missiles program. Kim has made increasingly provocative threats of nuclear conflict toward the United States and its allies in Asia in recent months.At the same time, the US has become increasingly concerned that North Korea may be preparing to carry out its first underground nuclear test in yearsYang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the law demonstrated Pyongyang's hopes of strengthening its relations with China and Russia at a time of heightened global tensions.\"North Korea mentioning the possibility of using nuclear weapons if and when an attack on the state and leader is imminent is significant, even though it states nuclear weapons as a defensive last resort,\" Yang said.
