        "content": " If you can't answer the question in this week's headline straight away, it probably says more about her than you. She's done so much over such a long period of time, it can be hard to quantify and there simply is no one else comparable.Queen Margrethe of Denmark is also long-serving and widely admired by her subjects but Elizabeth's reign has been longer and she has significantly more subjects.Perhaps we should first ask what the primary role of a monarch is?It isn't to serve for as long as possible; it's to serve well and leave the throne in a stronger position than when you inherited it. In that regard, Elizabeth has outperformed against all odds. She has reigned during a period of change that threatened the monarchy on many fronts. The media revolution put a largely unaccountable institution under unprecedented scrutiny and took away some of the mystique that made it so intriguing. That came with a loss of deference in wider society, which made the monarchy appear even more aloof and unrelatable. But the Queen has a unique ability to turn threats into opportunities and she embraced the media and used it to connect with her subjects, most famously by inviting cameras to film her on walkabouts and among the people. She televised the Christmas message and in doing so inserted herself into the most intimate family moment of the British year. She had an official social media account before any of her grandchildren. But Elizabeth's greatest counterstrike has to be the Commonwealth. When she acceded to the throne, her empire -- once the largest on Earth -- was collapsing. Country after country voted for independence and many saw it as the beginning of the end of the entire institution of monarchy. Elizabeth, then still in her 20s, stopped the rot by throwing herself behind a fledgling group her father had overseen for post-colonial nations. The Queen made the Commonwealth a priority and, under her stewardship, it has grown from eight members to 54 today. Why does that matter? Because it changed the narrative. As quickly as she was losing authority with a collapsing power base, she was regaining it as the figurehead of an association of independent states. She kept her international footprint and modernized at the same time.When she passes the crown to Charles, it will be less vulnerable than it was when she received it and that has to be her greatest achievement. The Queen's long-held wish to ensure the Commonwealth goes from strength to strength with Charles at its helm was granted in 2018, when the body named him as its next head. His ascension into the role was not guaranteed, as the British King or Queen is not automatically Head of the Commonwealth -- member countries choose who takes on the position. Since then, Charles has increasingly placed the modern Commonwealth at the forefront of his work as he prepares for his own reign. He is progressively taking on more Commonwealth responsibilities on his mother's behalf, like when he led the family on Monday at this week's Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. To coincide with the day, he also launched  for students from small island nations, many of which are part of the Commonwealth.  Charles is also set to represent the Queen at a rescheduled meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kigali, Rwanda in late June. It was supposed to have been held in June 2020 and was postponed twice amid coronavirus. In a statement Monday, Charles said it was \"more important than ever\" for members to come together as the world continues to recover from the pandemic. \"As a family of some 2.6 billion people from fifty-four nations across six continents, the Commonwealth represents a rich diversity of traditions, experience and talents which can help to build a more equal, sustainable and prosperous future,\" he added.But don't expect any sort of handover soon. The Queen may not have been well enough to attend this week's event, but in a message from Windsor she dispelled any suggestion that she might step down: \"In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in 1947, that my life will always be devoted in service.\"Thank you to those who sent in your thoughts on the . Many of the responses suggested the royals should lean in more on the tourism option, with a couple of folks even suggesting a hotel or bed and breakfast. Now, that would be an experience!Here are a few other answers: suggested transforming it fully into a \"museum displaying the history of England and the monarchy.\"recalled visiting the palace during the very first year it opened to the public. She suggested opening some of the areas that the Queen has used privately in recent decades, like various state rooms, ballrooms and perhaps her bedroom? \"Let 'common people' feel as if we had been let into the lives of the royals, especially the royal who has reigned the longest of any of them,\" she explained.Meanwhile,  suggested a completely different approach -- turn it into affordable housing. \"It's had its day and is time to use it for something functional for the populace,\" Carmine said. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be making final preparations to depart on their first official joint overseas trip since the start of the pandemic. Their royal tour of the Caribbean to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee year will start in Belize on Saturday before continuing to Jamaica and the Bahamas over the course of the week.It may be a tricky tour for the couple, who are visiting the region  over the royal family's relevance in several countries.Kensington Palace said William and Kate \"are keen to understand more about the impact that the pandemic has had across the Caribbean, and how communities have pulled together to respond.\" The visit will also celebrate the Queen's legacy in the countries, while touching on themes close to their hearts, including the environment, mental health and early childhood.The Royal Collection is reportedly withholding three swords bound for display in Moscow. The Queen's art collection had agreed to lend the 17th-century weapons to Moscow Kremlin Museums for an exhibition focused on dueling. However, permission was withdrawn in mid-February as Russia's troops gathered on Ukraine's borders prior to its unprovoked invasion of the country. \"A decision to postpone a loan of three swords from the Royal Collection to the Kremlin Museums in Moscow was made in mid-February,\" a Royal Collection Trust spokesperson . The museum announced the exhibition, which was due to open on March 4, had been postponed indefinitely. \"The core of the project consists of exhibits from European museums, which were forced to withdraw them before the time due to the geopolitical situation,\" it said in a statement on its website. The British Broadcasting Corporation has apologized \"unreservedly\" to Patrick Jephson, private secretary to the late Princess of Wales, over the methods journalist Martin Bashir used to secure his explosive Panorama interview more than 26 years ago. In the 1995 world exclusive, Diana confirmed Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and described how she believed royal life had made her bulimic. Retired judge John Dyson found falsely suggesting palace staff were being paid to spy on the princess in order to get Diana to speak to him, according to an independent investigation published last year. In a statement, the BBC said it \"accepts and acknowledges that serious harm was caused to Commander Jephson as a result of the circumstances in which the 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was obtained, which have become apparent as a result of the Dyson Report. The BBC apologises unreservedly to Commander Jephson for the harm caused to him and has paid his legal costs.\" The statement added that the corporation had paid \"a substantial sum in damages, which he intends to donate in full to British charities nominated by him.\" Jephson described the settlement as a \"relief\" and expressed his gratitude to Dyson and journalists for bringing \"the truth to light,\" according to Britain's PA Media news agency. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made several donations to on-the-ground organizations to support the people of Ukraine, according to a statement on their non-profit Archewell Foundation website on Friday. Aid from the couple has gone to refugee agency HIAS, mine clearance organization the HALO Trust and a coalition of Ukrainian media supported by the Are We Europe organization. \"All of us at Archewell have been inspired by the work these organizations have taken on -- and also by the stories from those on the frontlines,\" the statement read. Separately, the HALO Trust revealed Prince Harry recently spoke to two staffers, Olesia and Maryna, based in Ukraine. During the call, Harry praised their work, saying they are \"saving lives every single day.\" He added: \"I know that you're going to continue doing the work that is so desperately needed for HALO, for your families and your country.\" Watch some of their conversation below:Remember those ethereal official portraits released in ? Well, the shots taken by fashion photographer Paolo Roversi back in November are heading on a little tour of Great Britain.They are now part of the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is patron. But with the institution closed for redevelopment until next year, the portraits are being sent for display at venues close to Kate's heart. The tour is part of the gallery's \"Coming Home\" project, which sees pieces \"travel to towns and cities across the UK, providing communities with the opportunity to see iconic works locally,\" it said in a statement.Kate helped select the venues for her portrait tour, the gallery said. The black-and-white shot of the duchess looking to the left is to be displayed at St. James the Less Church in the village of Pangbourne, southeast England, from March 22 to April 5. It will then be shown at the nearby Reading Museum from April 7 to June 4. The church, the statement said, \"has welcomed the Middleton family as parishioners over several generations and the Reading Museum was chosen due to its proximity to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where The Duchess was born.\"The portrait of the duchess in a striking red gown is set for the Wardlaw Museum at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, where the duchess famously met her future husband while they were studying.Meanwhile, the other black-and-white portrait of Kate smiling broadly at the camera is headed to Oriel Môn in Anglesey, Wales, where the Cambridges lived in the first years of their marriage, for display between July 16 and October 22.Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said the institution was \"delighted\" to be sending the portraits to locations of significance to the duchess. He described her as \"a very committed\" patron who has a \"great interest in photography and portraiture.\"The Duke of Sussex will not return to the UK at the end of this month. A spokesperson for Prince Harry confirmed the royal will miss the thanksgiving service for his late grandfather, Prince Philip, which is due to be held at Westminster Abbey on March 29. However, the duke hopes to visit his grandmother as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.Despite his absence, Harry will be crossing the Atlantic soon enough. The duke has been brushing up his Dutch skills, according to a tongue-in-cheek promo for his upcoming Invictus Games in The Hague from April 19. In the clip, Harry impresses the local team with his Dutch pronunciation before he shows off his excitement about the event for sick and injured service personnel by changing into a bright orange ensemble. \"Let's go!\" he gleefully announces, pointing to the camera.

        "subtitle": "Joe Biden always says foreign relations is about relationships, and he's been developing the one he has with Vladimir Putin for two decades.",
        "content": " always says foreign relations is about relationships, and he's been developing the one he has with Biden warned that Putin had dreams of rebuilding  going all the way back to his days as a senator from Delaware. On the campaign trail, he said repeatedly Since the beginning of his time as President,  to guide his own response. It's even guided the way Biden deals with Putin in their conversations, repeatedly interrupting what he and aides see as the Russian President's strategy of going off on tangents meant to muddle and undermine.According to a dozen interviews with White House officials, members of Congress and others involved in the effort, Biden has deliberately worked with allies abroad to deny the Russian leader the one-on-one, Washington vs. Moscow dynamic that the President and his aides think Putin wants. Publicly and privately talking about the war as a fight for freedom and democracy, Biden has left other leaders to speak with Putin. He has moved just as deliberately at home to depoliticize opposition to the invasion of Ukraine so that, even among Republicans, support for Putin has been forced to the fringes so that vilifying the Russian leader has become the one major area of bipartisan agreement since Biden took office. This week Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric  a \"murderous dictator\"  \"What Putin is trying to do is surround and encircle Kyiv,\" said Rep. Greg Meeks, a Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"What Biden is trying to do is have the whole world surround Putin.\"Part of the lesson Biden took from being involved as vice president during Putin's 2014 invasion of Crimea was that NATO nations would need a much faster, more humiliating and more cohesive response than the months of infighting that produced sanctions so weak that Putin rode them out. Yet administration officials admit privately that if Putin had invaded Ukraine a year ago, events might have unfolded much differently coming right off four years of former President Donald Trump's damaging relationships and calling NATO obsolete.  Campaigning in 2020, Biden spoke about the confrontation he saw coming.\"Putin has one overriding objective: To break NATO, to weaken the Western alliance and to further diminish our ability to compete in the Pacific by working out something with China,\" Biden told CNN's Gloria Borger at the time. \"And it's not going to happen on my watch.\"Biden's own last conversation with Putin was on February 12, more than a week before the invasion started. And for a President and aides who on almost everything else complain that they don't get the credit they deserve, on Ukraine he and administration officials have ducked talk about him being leader of the free world, despite how much of the sanctions and international response are a result of Washington's guidance and pressure. The result is Putin's being boxed in more than even Biden had expected, along with a sustained level of attention to the war abroad and in America that has surprised White House aides -- without rebooting a 1980s-style Cold War. \"Joe Biden,\" a senior administration official said, \"has known Vladimir Putin for decades and knows exactly who he's dealing with.\"Cutting off Putin began, as Biden might say, literally. Whenever they'd speak, Biden would interrupt Putin as the Russian President launched into complaints that American officials see as a whataboutism tactic designed to distract and undermine. No, Biden would say, that's not what we're talking about, according to one senior administration official who has witnessed those conversations. Or, no, that's not how things happened 20 or 25 years ago, in whichever past grievance Putin was bringing up to justify his behavior. \"President Putin can't use a lot of his common tricks with President Biden, like trying to confuse people by going down long historical tangents or meandering into the minutiae of policies because President Biden sees those tactics coming a mile away and doesn't take the bait. He'll try to get President Biden off topic by citing an obscure section of the Minsk agreements or a speech someone gave in the late 1990s,\" a senior administration official said, adding that Biden \"is going to always steer the conversation directly back to what he's come to talk about.\"Biden has often told a story of a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin in 2011, when he was vice president, and telling the Russian leader, \"I'm looking in your eyes and don't think you have a soul\" -- a cutting response to President George W. Bush's infamous 2001 comments getting a sense of Putin's soul from looking him in the eye and finding him to be \"very straightforward and trustworthy.\" A Biden administration official, by contrast, sent CNN highlights of Biden's history on the topic over the years, from calling Putin a \"bully\" in 2006 to calling him a \"kleptomaniac\" in 2019. A White House aide who was in the Situation Room for a rushed National Security Council meeting on February 10 said was on display throughout how he ran the conversation in which the White House's assessment of an invasion moved from a possibility to an almost certainty. \"He was clear and clear eyed in that meeting that he believed that Putin would do this,\" the aide said. \"He spoke with the experience of somebody who knows Putin and has dealt with Putin.\"Biden thinks he wouldn't be able to keep the current levels of unity -- in the US -- if Putin sparked the kind of partisan , when many top Republicans spoke admiringly of his strength and leadership largely because he was taking on Barack Obama. Biden hasn't -- as some in his party want -- gone after Trump, brought up the attack on the 2016 elections or attacked Republicans for voting against the former President's first impeachment when Trump leveraged withholding military aid to Ukraine -- in pursuit of dirt on Biden.\"The crisis in Ukraine is clarifying what was at stake back then, and there should be accountability for that,\" said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the House Democrats' campaign arm. \"I don't think it makes sense to play politics with a war. I think it makes sense to be a moral voice for what's right and what's wrong -- and I'm proud that I belong to a party, and we have a president, who knows the good guys and the bad guys in Ukraine. And the other side seems to be struggling with that.\"That message won't be coming from the President himself.\"Putin wanted to divide us. We've been united. It's important that we send that signal to the world,\" the White House aide said.Most Republicans -- with a few notable outliers, including Trump's own clear struggle to try to erase the memory that his first response to the invasion was calling Putin \"smart\" and \"savvy\" -- have not gone on the attack against Biden, despite many differences among Republicans and Democrats alike about particulars of the President's response.Republicans have not, though, been convinced on the other part of Biden's strategy: Calling rising fuel costs \"Putin's price hike\" and \"Putin's gas tax\" as an attempt to assuage voters.\"These are not Putin gas prices. They are President Biden gas prices,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last week. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell added, \"It's pretty clear that Vladimir Putin is not the cause of this rampant inflation.\"White House aides are tracking all the Republicans in the House and Senate who are calling for tougher energy sanctions on Russia -- preparing to try to undermine them as hypocrites if they complain about higher gas prices on the campaign trail this fall. But at the same time, Biden himself has kept up outreach to Republican lawmakers. That's included personally briefing all four top congressional leaders together last month and surprising a bipartisan delegation to the Munich Security Conference with a call to thank them for their support. During that call, Vice President Kamala Harris held her cellphone to a microphone so the lawmakers could hear Biden speaking from behind the desk in the Oval Office.Putin has been tracking what Biden has been doing and saying about him for years. That includes friendly Russian commentators complaining in 2009 that Biden was a \"gray cardinal\" secretly orchestrating a tough Obama administration response to Putin's leadership after the then-vice president said Russia was limping along, or a Kremlin spokesman on Thursday saying that Biden's war criminal remark was \"unacceptable and unforgivable.\" Even as Biden has ramped up what he's been saying about Putin, there's only so far he can go before tripping into the escalation he's so desperately trying to avoid.  \"It hurts him to see the devastation in Ukraine, and it would be easy to say, 'That guy's evil and we're going after him and we're going to get him,'\" Meeks said. \"The question is: Is that the right thing? Because then you're talking about World War III.\" ",

        "content": "The new lucrative Saudi Arabia-backed golf league is a \"new opportunity\" for players and the sport, according to its chairman . Speaking to CNN Sport's , the two-time major winner said that he believes the new venture will provide a perfect environment to sustain the growth of golf while also allowing players themselves to expand their horizons. Norman explained that he believes that for the \"journeymen\" of golf, it can be a game-changing competition.\"If No. 283 (ranked player in the world), who just goes around and just plays through Asia, if he came and won $10-15 million, how great would that be for him, his family, the game of golf to actually reach out and give an opportunity for somebody, who's probably a journeyman on some tour out there, to change their lives?\" Norman told Davies. \"That's part of the beauty of it.\"On Wednesday, former world No. 1 Norman announced the formation of the new team-based, professional golf league. The venture, backed by , pledges to award $250 million in total prize money while hosting eight tournaments, held June through October.The news release announcing the series listed the events taking place in seven cities around the world: London; Portland, Oregon; Bedminster, New Jersey; Boston; Chicago; Bangkok; and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.The eighth event -- a team championship -- does not have a venue listed.Five events occur after the end of the PGA Tour season, but three of those occur at the same time as events on the DP World Tour.The PIF is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi's murder.On Saturday, March 12, Saudi Arabia  in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted.The source of the money behind the new league has caused golf commentators to question whether it is the best idea for the sport to find funding from a source with a questionable human rights record. But when pressed on the country's human rights record, Norman pointed to all the good work Saudi Arabia has done to grow golf. \"We're here to grow the game of golf. Money from Saudi Arabia has gone into the game of golf and since 2019, Saudi Arabia has put on the Saudi International,\" the 67-year-old said. \"That was co-sanctioned by the European Tour, now the DP World Tour. So the money's been there and the other tours have co-sanctioned these tournaments by Saudi money. Golf is good for the world and golf is good for Saudi Arabia too. We've seen it. \"Saudi Arabia has invested a lot of money into women's golf. They're the largest investor in women's golf today. So when you look at all the facts sitting out there, yes, our investor is Saudi money. I'm proud of that because, like I said, golf is good for the world and we're just going to grow the game of golf on a worldwide basis.\"Rumors of the new venture have sparked speculation about which golfers will play on it. News that the big-money Saudi-league had approached some of the biggest names in golf -- including Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau -- to be its poster boys caused players to publicly distance themselves from the so-called \"Super Golf League,\" with Johnson, DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy all reiterating their commitment to the PGA Tour. , one of the biggest names in the sport, caused controversy in February when he said he'd play in the league. He later apologized for his previous comments, lost multiple sponsorships over the controversy and said he will take some time away from golf.Although it is unclear which golfers will compete in the tournaments at the time of writing -- Norman said that \"nobody's signed up because it's an invitational and the invites haven't been sent out yet\" -- Norman doesn't think that they'll have any trouble attracting the biggest names. \"We're not going to have a problem getting to players,\" he said. \"I bet you we don't have a shortage of players, to tell you the truth. \"It's an invitation and the invitations will be going out and we'll gladly make an announcement about who's playing in the near future as we lead up to it. And as I said to the players, if you're sitting out there and you're liking what you're seeing, go apply for a release. \"From the European Tour, from the PGA Tour or whoever it is, go apply for a release. You have three releases, you have the right to go play under their rules and regulations today, go do it and go play.\"So you've got three out of the eight, and if you only play three then you might not get the individual world championship opportunity for the top three individual players which is $30 million at the end of the year after seven events. So the more you play, the more chance you have of catching that pool, no different to what the FedEx is for the players today.\" The currently established golf tours -- primarily the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- have expressed their opposition to the new venture. Norman told CNN's Davies that they have had to battle \"white noise\" which has been \"controlled by other entities\" to make strides towards getting off the ground. And the 20-time PGA Tour winner questioned what the PGA Tour has to fear from the new league. \"There have been a lot of obstacles put in our path, there's no question about it. The PGA Tour have fallen great, big redwood trees across our road but we've figured it out,\" he said. \"We're here for the long-term, I want to give the opportunity for players to have a better chance and more chance, other chances to go out there as independent contractors and go play golf. Let me ask you that question: what is wrong with that? And from the PGA Tour's standpoint, what are they afraid of, quite honestly, with us giving the opportunity for independent contractors to go out and play for additional golf? \"We're 100% additive to the game of golf. We just want to make the game of golf bigger and better, have a lot more evolution to the game of golf, enhance the entertainment side of things, for the fans, for the players, for the stakeholders, everybody. So as the players understand it now, it's a totally different narrative.\"",

        "content": "Nearly three months after buying a Megabucks lottery ticket and quickly forgetting about it, an Oregon man is a multimillionaire.Wilbur Brown was at the Moose Lodge in Springfield, Oregon, on Christmas Eve, when a friend bought a \"26 for $25\" Megabucks ticket. As Brown's friend explained to him, the ticket allowed players to buy into 26 consecutive drawings for just $25. Brown decided to buy a ticket too, which granted him access drawings until February 19, 2022. But after a few weeks, he forgot about the ticket.\"After the first few drawings, I'd check my ticket,\" Brown told the . \"Then I just kind of forgot about it and wasn't checking.\"It wasn't until February that Brown once again found himself at the Moose Lodge. A server scanned his ticket and received the message \"Large Lottery Winner.\" Brown and his friends consulted the internet to figure out exactly what  this meant -- and found out he'd hit a $8.9 million jackpot.Brown's lucky numbers were 15, 33, 34, 40, 42, and 47, according to the Oregon Lottery. He chose the 30-year annuity option for his winnings and will receive a check for slightly more than $200,000 after taxes each year until the prize is paid out.The odds of winning the jackpot were just 1 in 6,135,756 the Oregon Lottery says on its .The lodge where Brown bought his winning ticket  also lucked out from his purchase. Thanks to Brown's win, the Moose Lodge will receive a retailer selling bonus of $89,000 -- 1 percent of the jackpot.According to the lodge's manager, the win couldn't have come at a better time.\"The last couple of years have been a challenge for us,\" said Moose Lodge Manager Michael Scott,  \"The influence of receiving such a big chunk of change is huge! We'll be working with our members to figure out the best way to use the bonus money.\"",

Like other TikTokers, she is quick to note that watching videos is not a substitute for seeking professional help and that important concepts can get lost in the scrolling.

When dealing with trolls, Cubbage said, the emotional support from creators she's met on TikTok is indispensable. \"That's been one of the really neat things about the app is finding this community of Black therapists that have become like friends to me,\" she said. Unlike Facebook, which relies largely on a user's friends and followers to populate the feed, TikTok's algorithm, or \",\" has a heavy hand in what people see.

At the same time, she added, it can be frustratingly like a \"glass door\" for some, where the mental health services remain out of reach.\"Black people still underutilize mental health care in proportion to what the need is,\" she said.A  from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that in 2019, 36% of Black adolescents ages 12 to 17 who had major depressive episodes received treatment, compared with more than half of their White peers.Shortages in mental health care providers and the costs associated with therapy are factors, but \"more of it is, they're just not going to go,\" Breland-Noble said. \"Conversations have not changed that much for Black communities of the diaspora.\"Especially for older generations, Norton said, people have adapted a disease model of mental health, in which seeking help meant that there is \"something wrong with you.\" But the mindset has shifted, propelled by millennials and Gen Z, toward a wellness model without the same stigma attached.Norton hopes his videos will keep inching these conversations forward.

        "subtitle": "A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.",
        "content": "The White House spent much of Friday frustrated by an that it believes was based on a fabricated letter purportedly written by Ukraine's top national security official. The Axios story, written by reporter Zachary Basu, said that Oleksiy Danilov had asked the US earlier this month \"to go beyond traditional military aid and provide the country with the funding, training and weaponry to support a long-term resistance movement.\" But Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova later told Axios that she believed the letter was \"falsified.\" And officials at the National Security Council also told Axios they have no record of receiving such a letter from Danilov.Here's what I have gathered after talking to a senior administration official familiar with the matter: White House and CIA officials told Axios off the record on Thursday that they had no record of receiving Danilov's supposed letter and that they could not confirm its authenticity. In other words, they tried to wave Basu away from it. When Basu published his report anyway, the White House connected the outlet with Markarova so that she could relay that she believed it to be inauthentic. Markarova did so on Friday. Meanwhile, the White House repeatedly asked Axios to retract its story — all to no avail. \"We were appalled that Axios apparently did not have time to verify with Ukrainian officials whether or not this letter was a fake, but made sure to reach out to a former Trump official with no knowledge of the situation for a 'gotcha' quote,\" the senior admin official told me. \"And then we were even more appalled it stayed up all day despite our repeated asks to take the story down when became obvious the letter was a fake — which Axios should have dug up before publishing in the first place.\"Shortly after I contacted Axios for comment Friday evening, the outlet updated its story. Axios changed the headline — which initially read \"Scoop: Ukraine sought long-term resistance funding\" — to \"Ukraine's ambassador disputes letter asking U.S. for resistance support.\" The new story, which included Markarova saying the document appeared \"falsified,\" cited a \"former senior Ukrainian official close to Danilov\" who told Axios \"that they had received the letter from Danilov's office, and that it was also distributed to Ukrainian American groups and think tank experts in Washington.\" But crucially, the source also told Axios that he or she could not confirm the letter was officially transmitted to the US government — essentially the crux of the initial story.Notably, at that point, the article didn't include a correction or retraction, despite it seemingly having no real legs to stand on. Later in the evening, a proper correction was ultimately appended to the top of the story. It read, in part, \"This corrects an original version of this story that stated the Ukrainian government 'asked' for additional assistance from the U.S. government, when Axios was unable to confirm the letter was actually sent.\" Still, given that Axios is now conceding it was \"unable to confirm\" the main point of its initial story, it is surprising that a more forceful correction or full retraction wasn't issued.NSC spokesperson Emily Horne went on the record about the whole episode. In a statement to me, she said, \"We told Axios that we had not received this letter and were unable to verify its authenticity. There's a lot of disinformation and misinformation being pushed around about Ukraine right now. This is a moment where taking the extra time to verify reporting is even more essential than usual.\"",

        "content": "Abdel Kafi al-Hamdo cannot get  out of his mind. The 36-year-old Syrian spends his days following the news, tweeting messages of solidarity and teaching his five-year-old daughter Lamar how to draw the Ukrainian flag.  He says few can understand what Ukrainians are going through as unimaginable images of war, death and suffering are transmitted around the world. \"No one can understand Ukrainians,\" Hamdo told CNN. \"No one in the world can understand them more than Syrians.\"  For English teacher Hamdo, watching Russia's war on Ukraine has brought back memories of the darkest days of his life -- the siege of his city, Aleppo, in 2016.  Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.The war has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, including dozens of children, and forced more than three million people to flee the country.  But six years before its Ukraine war, Russia began another ruthless  thousands of kilometers away in Syria -- to prop up the Bashar al-Assad regime.  Victims of that war say the scenes from Ukraine on their television screens look hauntingly familiar.  With the help of Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's regime and its allies turned eastern Aleppo into a kill box. Three-hundred thousand of its residents were besieged, cut off from food and bombed into submission in December, 2016. It was a tactic used throughout the war and across the country, including alleged chemical attacks, which it denied. Those who survived the shelling had to leave behind what was left of their homes.    \"They destroyed us; they destroyed our psychology,\" Hamdo said. He recalled going to a hospital days before he left the city only to find himself walking over bodies to get through to his friend.  \"This is what will happen in Ukraine,\" he said. \"What's going on in Ukraine is only the beginning.\"   Some in Syria say their country was the canary in the coalmine that the world chose to ignore. It was a testing ground for Russia's war machine and a preview of its ambitions closer to home.  Hamdo was among a group of Aleppo residents who chronicled their life under siege. They posted daily videos on social media, appealing for the international community to save them. They say their calls fell on deaf ears.   \"What's affecting me a lot is that the world is repeating the same mistake [in Ukraine],\" an emotional Hamdo told CNN. He said it pains him that condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine was as if \"it's [Russia's] first war or first killing.\"  \"I cannot even imagine why people were blinded for 10 years,\" he said.  In 2013, the Obama administration said that the Assad regime crossed a \"\" by using chemical weapons on its own people. But Western states decided against military intervention.  Then, in 2015, the Russian military intervened to prop up a weakened Assad, turning the tide of war in his favor.Today, Russia maintains a presence in Syria and Assad has regained  control of most of the country. Several Arab states have re-established diplomatic ties with his regime.  For Russia, the intervention had multiple advantages. It solidified its ally's power, gave it a foothold in the region and invaluable military experience.  The Russian defense minister even boasted about using Syria as a testing ground for the military.   \"We have tested over 320 [types of weapons], in fact, we have tested all the weapons, except for easy-to-understand versions [in Syria],\" Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was  by Russian state media as saying in August.   Ismail al-Abdullah, a member of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group, witnessed firsthand the impact of those weapons on civilians. He was among the last group of Aleppo residents forced out of the city in 2016, having witnessed the pummeling of Syria's second city by airstrikes. \"Aleppo was like doomsday,\" he told CNN.  \"I saw buildings collapsed on the heads of families and children,\" he said. \"In one of the incidents 34 people were killed under a collapsed building by the bombing.\" Abdullah said that building was struck by a bunker buster bomb.  During its military intervention in Syria, Russia has unleashed an indiscriminate bombing campaign on population centers, having struck hospitals, markets and schools.    The United Nations' Independent Commission for Inquiry on Syria has said regime forces and Russia have indiscriminately bombed densely populated areas, having targeted and killed civilians.  Warring parties in the country have enabled the violation of nearly every core human right and nearly every war crime, Commission Chair Paulo Sergio Pinheiro said in Geneva earlier this month. \"We can only hope that world leaders are doing everything they can to avoid a similar fate for Ukraine.\"   Despite evidence collected by various organizations and witness testimony, Russia denies committing war crimes in Syria.  Many Syrians feel that the impunity with which Russia acted in Syria may have emboldened President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.   \"What happened in Syria is like a lesson for the world that if they did something in the first place to help the Syrian people to stop Russia, maybe this would not be happening,\" Abdullah said. \"Russia would have stopped in the first place in Syria and would not have the courage to invade Ukraine.\"  The White Helmets, who knows Russia's playbook all too well, expressed concern for the situation in Ukraine and has offered tips to Ukrainians.  \"Don't respond to any bombing scene until the sky is clear of war planes,\" Abdullah said, warning Ukrainians about Russia's \"double tap\" bombings.  He lost colleagues in several of those attacks, where warplanes drop bombs on an area then strike the same area again in a few minutes, often killing first responders and those injured from the first strike.   \"Do not walk in open roads,\" he added. \"There will be snipers who will shoot you ... they do not care if you are a civilian, a rescue worker or a paramedic.\"  Members of Abdullah's team gather at their station in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria. They are in a constant state of alert. The ceasefire Russia and Turkey  there in 2020 is fragile. In the second half of 2021, the UN documented at least  by pro-government forces that killed children including those on their way to school.   At refugee camps nearby, where wave after wave of Syrians displaced by those Russian airstrikes are now pressed against the Turkish border. They watch the war in Europe closely. Many feel their fate is tied to that of Ukraine.   \"I am following the news in Ukraine and wish that Ukraine will win the war, so Russia does not go further,\" 48-year-old Umm Hussein said. \"Here in Syria they killed, destroyed and displaced us, making us refugees. If Russia wins [in Ukraine], it will go further and attack us.\"  Despite their fears, there is empathy in the camps for the suffering from a war in faraway Ukraine.      \"We are very emotional and affected by the scenes from Ukraine. As we see children dying, we are crying for them. We feel [for] them as we lived the same suffering,\" she said. The Gulf Cooperation Council has offered to host talks between Yemen's warring parties between March 29-April 7 in Riyadh, Secretary General Nayef al-Hajraf said on Thursday. But the Iran-backed Houthis said they would only attend talks in a \"neutral\" country -- not in Saudi Arabia, which has been leading a coalition battling the Houthis since 2015. The United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed discussed oil and food prices with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov during a visit to Moscow on Thursday.

Hassan Azzazy, a professor at the American University in Cairo, is experimenting with three plant species from Sinai to create what he calls \"NanoEbers\" wound dressings made of natural materials that expedite the healing process.  The idea first emerged through a doctoral thesis submitted by his former student and project co-founder, Wissam Sarhan. The two chemists identified the plants in the Sinai with the help of the region's Bedouin tribes, who for generations have relied on herbs and plants for different forms of treatment.  Plants have generally been used as medicine for more than 60,000 years, says the US Department of Agriculture. Sinai's rich natural habitat is ripe for research. \"These are made from biodegradable nanofibers, medicinal plants collected from Sinai,\"  Azzazy told CNN from his university lab in Cairo.  Wounds are often treated with synthetic material to heal skin, yet studies have shown that wound healing can greatly benefit from medicinal plants, according to the US National Library of Medicine.  Azzazy and Sarhan prepare the nanofibers, collect them on a piece of dressing cloth and add antibacterial material extracted from medical plants.  Nanofibers are man-made materials made from a mix of synthetic and natural polymers. \"NanoEbers\" mainly relies on natural materials to build nanofibers, such as honey, bee venom and even parts of shrimp and crab.  Azzazy and Sarhan's project is still in its prototype phase, awaiting approval by the ministry of health and funding for commercialization. Their wound dressings have not yet been tested on humans, as they require approval from health authorities.  100 years ago, Egypt unilaterally declared independence from the British protectorate and established an independent kingdom. While independence was limited, it was a landmark step in Egypt's trajectory toward full independence in 1952. Following mass protests led by revolutionary Saad Zaghloul in 1919, Egypt declared independence on February 28, 1922, and installed the first King of Egypt and Sudan on March 15, 1922. While the British recognized Egypt as an independent state, they maintained exceptions through which colonial control was upheld. Scholars describe Egypt's 1922 independence as limited yet important for the formation of the modern Egyptian state. The British-backed monarchy reigned until the 1952 revolution, instigated by a military coup under Gamal Abdel Nasser and his group of Free Officers. ",

        "content": " launched missile strikes near an airport in  on Friday, a strategic  not far from the Polish border that had until now largely been spared from the relentless bombardment witnessed across much of the country during the war. Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant, but that work at the facility had stopped before the strikes and there were no reports of casualties. Ukraine's armed forces say initial information suggests Russia launched six missiles towards Lviv on Friday morning. It says the missiles were most likely air-launched cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Black Sea.Two of the six were intercepted by air defense systems, the armed forces' statement on Facebook said.The attack will add to concerns that Russia's war could spread further west. Here's what you need to know about the importance of Lviv. At about 43 miles (70 kilometers) from Poland's border, Lviv is at NATO's doorstep — so if attacks are ramped up here, it could have international repercussions.Friday's attack comes after Russia launched a barrage of missiles at the , located between Lviv and the Polish border, on Sunday, killing at least 35 people. Lviv has become a safe haven for Ukrainians fleeing other war-torn parts of the country.It hosts more than 200,000 internally displaced people in a city of just over 700,000, according to the mayor. They've flooded into Lviv in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the border.The larger region serves also as a crucial weapons supply route to the Ukrainian military and a wider resistance effort that has foiled Moscow's plans for a blitz-like invasion.Western Ukraine's supply lanes have become even more important as Russia chokes off sea passages and lays siege to the country's south. To the north is Belarus, which hosts Russian troops and has been one of the launching pads of the invasion. Lviv's historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the National Museum houses the country's most complete collection of sacred medieval art and rare religious manuscripts.According to the city's official website, Lviv was the site of Ukraine's first mass actions in support of independence when communism collapsed. On September 17, 1989 Lviv became the site of the largest demonstration in support of revival of Ukraine's independence, with 100,000 participants. The Act on State Independence of Ukraine was passed on August 24, 1991 and hundreds of people flooded the streets of Lviv in celebrations the following day. \"Being an indisputable capital of Ukrainian culture, spirituality and national identity, Lviv has always played a major role in the development of democracy and struggle for Ukraine's independence,\" the website states.Lviv was once part of the Hapsburg monarchy -- then known as Lemberg -- but became the real stronghold of Ukrainian national resistance during Soviet times, according to the country's official . Details on  describe how Lviv, founded in the late Middle Ages, became a flourishing administrative, religious and commercial center for several centuries. Up until the invasion, the medieval urban topography, as well as the city's many fine Baroque and later buildings, were well preserved, according to UNESCO. UNESCO earlier this month it was in permanent contact with all relevant institutions across Ukraine, as well as with Ukrainian cultural professionals, to assess the situation and to reinforce the protection of cultural properties.At the start of the conflict Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General,  said: \"We must safeguard the cultural heritage in Ukraine as a testimony of the past, but also as a catalyst for peace and cohesion for the future, which the international community has a duty to protect and preserve.\"The city has also become the makeshift home for many media organizations and embassies, which were forced to relocate from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.",

        "subtitle": "• Analysis: Call came at critical moment",
        "content": "President Joe Biden sought to use  to dissuaderom assisting Russia in its war on Ukraine, a pivotal moment that could determine the trajectory of the bloody conflict.President Xi Jinping told Biden that both the US and China have a responsibility for ensuring peace, according to state media, an oblique suggestion he is uninterested in escalating the conflict. Afterward, however, the White House said its concerns over Beijing's possible intervention haven't been assuaged.\"We have that concern,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. \"The President detailed what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians. And that is something we'll be watching and the world will be watching.\"Senior administration officials described the call as \"direct,\" \"substantive\" and \"detailed,\" but would not offer many details about the lengthy conversation. The bulk of the leaders' discussion centered on the war in Ukraine and the implications the crisis would have for US-China relations and the \"international order,\" an official said. But the administration refused to publicly detail what those consequences would be.Biden's goal  was partly to ascertain where exactly the Chinese President stood, and it remained unclear afterward whether he'd gained much clarity. He did not make any specific requests of Xi, the White House said, choosing instead to offer a broader view of the international situation.\"China has to make a decision for themselves on where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions,\" Psaki said. \"That is a decision for President Xi to make.\"At the Presidents' request, US and Chinese officials will continue discussions in the coming days, the White House said. And Biden plans to discuss China's role with other Western leaders at a snap NATO summit next week in Brussels, Belgium.China's statements about the war in Ukraine have stopped short of denouncing the invasion but also not offered explicit support.  for mediation efforts between Russia and Ukraine, but China has also fannedThat all left Xi in a murky position, which the United States hoped to clarify through Biden's call.Already, the US had warned European and Asian allies that China had expressed openness  assistance, which Moscow had requested as its halting invasion stretched into a third week. But officials said Beijing was still formulating how to respond, upping the stakes for Biden's intervention Friday.China began offering its own account of the video call moments after it began, describing Xi's message to Biden on state television.\"We must not only lead the development of China-US relations down the correct path, but also shoulder our international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquility,\" Xi said on the video call, according to CCTV.\"The world is neither peaceful nor tranquil,\" Xi acknowledged. \"The Ukraine crisis is something we don't want to see.\"At the same time,  for the conflict nor denounce Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions on the ground.The United States has watched warily as Xi cultivates a close partnership with Putin, believing the alliance of authoritarian leaders is positioning itself to oppose the United States militarily and economically. During high-profile talks in Beijing last month, Xi and Putin sealed their affiliation, declaring in a lengthy statement the relationship was limitless.Yet Russia's invasion of Ukraine has unsettled Chinese leaders, in part because the Russian military has suffered surprising losses and advanced more slowly than many expected. US officials have also said Xi was surprised by unity among Western and Asian nations in imposing punishing sanctions on Russia.That combination of factors could lead China to reevaluate its potential involvement in the Ukraine war, US officials have said. That made the timing of Biden's call with Xi critical as the US works to contain the bloodshed in Ukraine.Ahead of time, American officials declined to say what specific threats Biden might make to convince Xi to withhold support for Russia. There have been ongoing discussions within the administration about potential steps, including sanctions.It is widely assumed Xi will secure a historic third term in power during the Communist Party's 20th National Congress in Beijing this fall. During such an important year, western experts believe Xi will be particularly mindful of the economic risks posed by secondary sanctions. Trade between the European Union and China topped $800 billion last year, and US-China trade was over $750 billion, according to China's official data, while its trade with Russia was just under $150 billion. At the same time, China's economy is growing more slowly than it has in decades.Ahead of their conversation, American officials made clear the stakes of the conversation.\"The ask is that China needs to stand on the right side of history,\" deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman said on CNN.",

        "content": "Two Premier League managers sat before the media to discuss a football match earlier this month. One faced questions on the sanctioning of a Russian oligarch, while the other was asked about the  of 81 men in one day in Saudi Arabia. Premier League matches might have huge global appeal and its broadcast deals are worth billions of dollars, but right now the organization finds itself at the eye of a moral, ethical, and political storm.That storm raged fiercely when played Newcastle United on March 13, a game pitting two of the most controversial club ownerships in world football against each other. It's been dubbed the Premier League's \"game of shame.\"The fixture was played soon after the UK government  Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as one of \"Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin,\" according to a UK government press release.Meanwhile, Newcastle's controversial takeover by the last year also raised ethical concerns even ​before it was approved by the Premier League.The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 ​murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi's murder.The day before the match between Chelsea and Newcastle, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted. Earlier in March, British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who played a key role in the consortium's acquisition of Newcastle, said it wasn't \"particularly fair\" that Abramovich had been forced to sell Chelsea as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"I'm sad someone is going to have a football club taken away because of a link they may have with someone,\" Staveley, who owns a minority stake in Newcastle, was quoted as saying at the Financial Times' Business of Football Summit in London, according to the FT.\"I don't think that's particularly fair to be honest, but we do have to hold all of our relationships to account. We'll always have geopolitical issues, this world is never not going to have problems,\" she added.The sanctioning of Abramovich means Chelsea must find answers -- and quickly -- to an array of questions: how to finish the season, how to ensure a smooth sale to a new owner, and, fundamentally, how to ensure Chelsea Football Club can continue to operate next season.But Chelsea's current predicament also raises uncomfortable oversight questions for the Premier League and the UK government regarding an approach that has often been described as \"light-touch regulation.\"Death and destruction in Ukraine ultimately triggered Abramovich's sanctioning, yet Chelsea's owner did not suddenly become \"close to Putin,\" as the UK government alleged in its announcement of sanctions against him, in the few weeks before or since the invasion.\"He [Abramovich] is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin,\" the UK government said in a statement following the sanctions announcement.Last month, British lawmaker Chris Bryant cited a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns Abramovich had \"links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,\" the MP said in Parliament.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the sanctions.Over 30 spectacularly lucrative years, the Premier League built its multi-billion-dollar industry on a process of self-regulation, with the UK government content to take a non-interventionist approach as it basked in the success of a globally attractive business.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the horror that has subsequently unfolded may be changing all that​.Suddenly, urgent questions are being asked about whether the vetting of new owners should take into consideration the issue of human rights as the UK government finds itself overseeing the sale of one of the country's biggest teams.The Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test lays out conditions that would bar prospective individuals from owning a club, notably prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies.Prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies didn't apply to Abramovich or bin Salman, though following the imposition of sanctions by the UK government, the Premier League Board did disqualify the Russian oligarch as a director of Chelsea Football Club on March 12.One clause stipulates any individual could be disqualified \"in respect of any offense involving any act which could reasonably be considered to be dishonest,\" whether committed in or outside the UK and regardless of whether it resulted in a conviction.Football accountancy specialist Kieran Maguire told CNN that the test presents a low bar to prospective owners and says that is very much by design.\"It's a relatively low hurdle,\" Maguire told CNN. \"And part of the reason for that is because the rules are determined by the owners themselves.\"The last thing they want to do -- given most will eventually be looking for an exit route -- is make the criteria for selling too difficult. This would reduce the pool for buyers, which reduces the price.\"Asked for comment, the Premier League pointed CNN towards the evidence of its chief policy officer Helen McNamara at Tuesday's parliamentary committee hearing.\"This is an extraordinary, complex and unprecedented situation. It's pretty new to all of us,\" said McNamara, referring to the issue of Chelsea and Abramovich.\"We already have an independent panel, chaired by a QC, who oversee our sanctioning regime and we are in the process of putting together an independent panel that will support the Premier League board and scrutinizing their decision making on the Owners' and Directors' Test.\"According to Maguire, the test primarily is designed to ask whether a potential owner has unspent criminal convictions and whether they have the resources to fund the club.  To change any aspect of the test, 14 or more of the 20 Premier League clubs would have to vote in favour.In 2018, Abramovich had issues with his UK visa and was subsequently granted Israeli citizenship, according toThat visa issue came at a time of diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of a former Russian spy with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March. Nonetheless Abramovich continued to own Chelsea.And despite many -- including the fiancée of late journalist Khashoggi -- voicing human rights concerns, the  When the  was announced in October, the Premier League stressed that it was the PIF, rather than the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, behind the takeover.Lawmaker Julian Knight, who chaired Tuesday's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and meeting, told Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston that the Owners' and Directors' Test \"wouldn't have stopped the Saudi takeover, it wouldn't have stopped Roman Abramovich taking over.\"\"It seems to be ... if you have enough money, therefore you can buy a football club. Is that really the right way to go or should there be a more stricter outlook in terms of the integrity of the ownership of a football club?\"Huddleston replied: \"What I can say is that we do recognise there is a need for further refinement and more robust Owners and Directors Test and of course the integrity element of that is something that is being pushed.\" \"We recognize — and the Premier League recognize -- that the Owners' and Directors' Test needs further work, it needs to be a more robust ... but it's really important that we continue to make sure we have a robust and very successful football ecosystem in the UK. \"The Premier League is a major global success story, it's an outstanding export earner for the UK and we welcome investment.\"Asked if he welcomed the Newcastle takeover, Huddleston replied: \"Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK across multiple areas including investment, intelligence, culture and other elements.\"That purchase was a commercial decision which the government did not take part in. That was within the law and within the restriction of the Owners' and Directors' Test of the Premier League.\"Former Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore recently said that the UK government \"actively\" encourages investment by the Saudi sovereign wealth funds.​\"\"I'm not too sure that the Premier League should take any sort of stance that is not, in some ways, consistent with UK law and governance,\" Scudamore told the University of Cambridge's Varsity website.Maguire believes it is \"feasible\" that a human rights clause could be added to the criteria, citing recent comments made by the Premier League's current CEO Richard Masters.Earlier this month, Masters told the FT's Business of Football summit ​that the league had held discussions with Amnesty International about including a human rights section to its Owners' and Directors' Test.Conceding that the test had \"been under a lot of scrutiny for the last 12 months,\" Masters said the Premier League is seeking \"external contributions\" to amend the test. That comes after UK lawmaker Tracey Crouch's review of football called for the reform of the test and for it to come under the control of an independent regulator.Referencing both the test's pending review and discussions of an independent regulator, Huddleston remarked that English football was at a \"turning point.\"\"There has been a bit of a wake up call here,\" Huddleston said, \"particularly as it relates to Russian investment ... The mood's changing -- I think we are at the cusp of quite significant change in sport.\"The change in mood was echoed by leading pundit Gary Neville, who in recent years has been vocal about a range of issues facing the game, notably the idea of a European Super League.The former Manchester United and England defender described recent events at Chelsea as \"a massive wake up call,\" both for himself and English football.Having initially welcomed  -- be it from Abramovich, the PIF, or the Abu Dhabi United Group at Manchester City -- Neville said he was no longer quite so sure about the benefits of the investment of nation states and oligarchs like Abramovich.\"I can imagine the executive of the Premier League sat there looking at their owners and saying, 'What do we do with this situation?'\" Neville told  on Monday. \"They'll be sat there very nervously thinking, 'We don't want to set a precedent here -- what do we do?'\"\"Football is absolutely coming under huge scrutiny,\" Neville added.Meanwhile, the Premier League's bottom line couldn't look healthier.As of next season, a new $6.65 billion package will see the Premier League's international broadcasting income overtake domestic broadcasting rights for the first time, raking in a total of more than $13.8 billion dollars from broadcasting rights alone, according to \"It's indicative of the league's success and appeal to a global audience,\" Maguire said of the deal. \"The Premier League is the envy of all the other leagues in Europe.\"",

        "content": "For the first time since the dawn of the Mercedes era -- the team has now won eight consecutive constructors' championships -- there is genuine uncertainty about how the Formula One season will unfold, with the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday kicking off the new campaign.A raft of new regulations, the biggest change in the sport since 1983, has prompted every team to drastically redesign its car, while Mercedes was beaten in the drivers' championship last year for the first time since 2014. Last season's  in Abu Dhabi saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen win his first world championship, pipping seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in the final lap. In near unison with the , F1 moved to sanction Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. The sport's governing body  that the Russian Grand Prix, originally scheduled for September 23-25, could not be held \"in the current circumstances.\" Shortly afterward, it terminated its contract with the Russian Grand Prix promoter, \"meaning Russia will not have a race in the future,\" read an F1 statement. The Russian Grand Prix had been due to move from Sochi to the newly renovated Igora Drive circuit in St. Petersburg in 2023.Haas, meanwhile,  the contract of its Russian driver Nikita Mazepin as well as its title sponsor Uralkali, a Russian fertilizer producer part owned by Mazepin's oligarch father, . Hamilton and Verstappen's rivalry shaped F1 in 2021, a season widely acclaimed as one of the greatest ever due to their extraordinarily close title fight. In recent years, Verstappen has emerged as the only driver capable of challenging Hamilton's dominance, and their rivalry will define the contours of this season too.During their season-long duel in 2021, they crashed into each other three times -- at ,  and .The denouement was even more dramatic. Arriving at the final Grand Prix of the season, the two drivers were level in the race for the world championship.Verstappen secured pole position in qualifying, but Hamilton overtook him as they rounded the first corner and held a commanding lead for much of the race. It seemed the title was decided until a late safety car effectively restarted the race with Verstappen just behind Hamilton on newer, faster tires. Verstappen overtook Hamilton and won his. The fallout of the controversy still lingers. At 37, Hamilton is approaching the end of his career and will not have many more opportunities to claim the outright record of world championship wins. He currently sits on seven, level with Michael Schumacher, but his motivation does not seem diminished by the controversy in Abu Dhabi.\"I would say so,\" Hamilton replied when asked if he was a more dangerous driver than before, in a video uploaded onto Mercedes' Twitter page.Verstappen is at the opposite end of his career and has long been billed as a potential multiple world champion. Last season, the Dutchman's consistency was remarkable as he finished first or second in every race he completed without damage to his car. He is the focal point of the Red Bull team, with whom he will until at least 2028. The traditional merry-go-round of drivers swapping seats ended rather late this year as teams sought to fine-tune their rosters ahead of the 2022 season. Alfa Romeo will sport an all-new driver's line up as , the first Chinese F1 driver, joins the team -- the only driver making his F1 debut this season.Zhou joins Alfa Romeo after finishing third in Formula Two last year and serving as a test driver for both Renault and Alpine.\"To be the first ever Chinese driver in F1 is a breakthrough for Chinese motorsport history,\" Zhou told F1. \"I know a lot of hopes will be resting on me and, as ever, I will take this as motivation to become better and achieve more.\"Valtteri Bottas also joins Alfa Romeo, replacing the retired Kimi Raikkonen. His seat at Mercedes has been given to George Russell, after months of speculation, who in turn is replaced by Alexander Albon at Williams.Russell's association with Mercedes stretches back to 2017 when he joined their junior driver program. Following Haas' dismissal of Mazepin, Kevin Magnussen will rejoin his old team on a multi-year deal. Previously, Magnussen drove for Haas from 2017 until the end of the 2020 season.Not since 1983 has F1 introduced such sweeping new regulations governing the designs of the cars. These new regulations aim to make overtaking easier by shifting the aerodynamic focus from the wings to underneath the car. The car's design will help to create downforce -- crucial to the performance of F1 cars, allowing the tires to continue gripping the track at extreme speeds -- by controlling the airflow around it. However, the 2021 cars lost much of their downforce when traveling behind another car. This was due to the disrupted airflow that trails behind the lead car, a phenomenon often referred to as 'dirty air.' As such, it can be difficult to overtake -- particularly on corners -- since the driver in front has a natural advantage.By redesigning the cars and shifting the principal site of aerodynamics to underneath the car, F1 hopes to reduce the impact of this 'dirty air' and facilitate overtaking. They estimate that the 2022 cars will only lose 4% of their downforce within three car lengths of the car in front and 18% within one car length. The true effects of these new regulations will only be apparent when the racing begins on Sunday, but during testing, Pierre Gasly and Hamilton provided a preview as they, briefly, drove side-by-side along the track.\"It was interesting also to follow and just to get some data and feeling following other cars... we kind of overtook each other a couple of times, stayed close to each other -- and it was definitely an improvement, so I think racing should be quite fun this year,\" Gasly told F1.Preseason testing assumed added importance this year, due to the new regulations and car designs on display.Red Bull performed well, with their newly crowned world champion Verstappen setting the fastest time by nearly seven-tenths of a second on the final day of preseason testing in Bahrain.Both Ferrari drivers recorded consistently quick laps in Bahrain, suggesting their car's reliability, while Charles Leclerc set the second-fastest lap time behind Verstappen.Mercedes, meanwhile, unveiled a drastically different car to other teams, featuring much narrower sidepod inlets: a design that could prompt challenges, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff acknowledged.Despite this, their test runs lagged someway behind Red Bull and Ferrari. Both Russell and Hamilton downplayed their chances in Bahrain, citing the car's continued issues with porpoising -- a phenomenon that occurs when a car reaches its top speed and bounces up and down on its suspension -- during testing.\"It's definitely bouncing around a lot from within, it's not the comfiest in all honesty,\" Russell said to F1. \"I don't really care about comfort if the performance is there but at the moment the performance isn't there.\" \"We are a step behind our rivals, and we do have a lot of work to do between now and next week to understand because, in every condition, the Red Bull and the Ferrari seem a step ahead of us.\" Last year, Mercedes' testing was also  as they completed the fewest laps of any team, but Hamilton still won the opening race in Bahrain. Similarly in 2019, Mercedes looked up to half a second off Ferrari's pace in testing and then finished one-two in the first race of the season.Still, they will need to improve drastically to challenge the preseason performances of both Ferrari and Red Bull, and such improvements may take a couple of races to implement.McLaren were another team who underperformed during testing in Bahrain, plagued by braking issues. Behind the top four teams, there was little to separate the midfield in testing, with Haas, AlphaTauri, Alpine, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo all performing relatively well. Williams struggled on Day 2 of testing in Bahrain with a brake fire but suffered no other major setbacks. has become almost synonymous with F1 in recent years; the popular documentary series on Netflix has done much to boost the sport's popularity around the world.According to ESPN, average viewing figures for Grands Prix in the US have increased since  was released, rising from about 547,000 in 2018 to 928,000 in 2021.The dramatic, controversial conclusion of last year's championship prompted some, including Lando Norris, to wonder if it had been manufactured for the show's benefit. Speaking to BBC Sport, James Gay-Rees -- the show's producer -- rebuffed these criticisms. \"It's just people under enormous pressure making decisions in the moment,\" he said. \"There's no way anybody was thinking: 'Will this play well on Netflix?'\"The show has previously been criticized for its tendency to exaggerate interpersonal rivalries and warp timelines.Nonetheless, even if  does not shape the storylines throughout the season, it will shape their public perception. In the US, ESPN is set to show every F1 race, practice and qualifying as will F1 TV Pro, the official streaming service of F1, which costs $79.99 per year. Practice for the opening race of the season -- the Bahrain Grand Prix -- begins at 8 a.m. ET on March 18, qualifying will take place on March 19 from 8 a.m. ET and the race is scheduled for March 20 at 11 a.m. ET.

        "content": "On February 12, 2020, Jacque Hollander sat in a conference room on the third floor of an Atlanta courthouse and told prosecutors she thought James Brown had been murdered.District Attorney Paul Howard listened, took notes, and accepted a green plastic bin full of items that Hollander said were corroborating evidence. The DA said his investigators would look into her claims about Brown's death.But it seems not much was done, according to a CNN review of internal documents released in recent weeks. Potential evidence went untested. A key witness died without being interviewed. There is no indication that anyone tried to obtain Brown's medical records. And when the DA's office returned Hollander's property in a cardboard box in March 2022, she said all the most important items she'd handed over were missing, without explanation.The documents obtained by CNN make clear that in nearly two years and under two Fulton County district attorneys, prosecutors did very little to answer lingering questions about Brown's final minutes.\"They never did anything on this case,\" Hollander said. \"And that's ridiculous.\"Current Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis succeeded Howard in 2021 and closed the inquiry without taking action. Her spokesperson, Deputy District Attorney Jeff DiSantis, did not respond to an interview request or a detailed list of questions.Hollander first called me in 2017 to allege that the Godfather of Soul had been murdered at an Atlanta hospital on Christmas Day in 2006. His official cause of death was a heart attack and fluid in the lungs, and his daughter Yamma Brown declined to have an autopsy done. But I found a dozen other people who knew Brown and said they wanted an autopsy or a criminal investigation. Those people included Marvin Crawford, the doctor who signed Brown's death certificate and later told me he was \"highly suspicious that somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death\"; and Andre White, a longtime friend of Brown who said he kept a vial of Brown's blood from the hospital in the hope of proving that Brown had been murdered. \"I would like to know,\" White said in a 2017 interview, \"who basically killed him?\" Early in 2020, about a year after CNN published , Howard agreed to meet with Hollander. In that February 12 meeting, which I also attended and recorded, Hollander said prosecutors should interview the following people to learn more about the circumstances of Brown's death:       After Hollander told her story, the district attorney said he had a list of six people to interview. His investigators took the bin into evidence and gave her a property receipt. Video footage released by the DA's office shows two employees cataloguing numerous items and placing them into clear plastic evidence bags. Hollander's property receipt said, \"Green Plastic Storage Bin... Bin contains various items of clothing, hair rollers, combs, shoes, etc... (Due to the nature of what is 'said to be contained within the bin' , we did not conduct an inventory; so as not to contaminate the 3rd floor Grand Jury Room)... An inventory will be conducted as soon as practical...\"\"Within a period of six months,\" Howard told Hollander, \"we will see whether or not we can talk to the people that you've described. If at the end of that period, we are not able to substantiate what you've brought to us, we will then call you and return the items to you.\" In the months after he agreed to examine Brown's death, the district attorney faced one crisis after another.It wasn't just the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Howard was under criminal investigation for the alleged misuse of public funds. (Howard paid $6,500 to settle a case with the state ethics commission but predicted he would be  A spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the case has been turned over to the Georgia Attorney General.) In June, Howard was accused of rushing to charge a police officer in the death of Rayshard Brooks before the investigation was complete. Howard responded that he was As the pandemic continued, Jacque Hollander wondered what would become of the James Brown inquiry. But on July 7, 2020, according to documents obtained by CNN through the Georgia Open Records Act, she got some reassurance.In a note written that day, Assistant District Attorney Michael Sprinkel apologized for being out of touch. He said the pandemic had hampered grand jury proceedings and in-person interviews. He told her not to worry about  He wrote, \"these statements did not dissuade me from pursuing this investigation.\" \"Lastly,\" Sprinkel wrote to Hollander, \"I expect that in the coming weeks and months, we will learn to co-exist with this virus. So this investigation will continue.\" Sprinkel sent a copy of the note to Chris Hopper, the spokesman for the DA's office. Nine minutes later, he emailed Hopper again: \"I'm on the phone with her right now, too.\"Hollander spent almost four hours on the phone with the assistant district attorney that day, she later told me. She said he wanted to begin issuing subpoenas and applying for search warrants. Hollander and Sprinkel spoke again the next day. She told me Sprinkel told her he would soon be seeking indictments.Sprinkel did not respond to a detailed list of questions I sent for this story, including questions about what he told Hollander.Did Hollander understand correctly? Was an indictment on the horizon? A recording of the call would help answer these questions. Sprinkel sometimes records calls with potential witnesses. I know this because a brief recording of Sprinkel's call to someone else was included in the documents I received from the DA's office. I requested a copy of Sprinkel's call with Hollander, but the DA's legal counsel, Don Geary, told me that no such recording exists.On August 11, 2020, about a month after Sprinkel's long call with Hollander, DA Paul Howard lost a runoff election by a nearly 3-to-1 margin to Fani Willis, his former employee, which meant his term would expire by the end of the year.Two days later, Jacque Hollander said she received a phone call from Candice Hurst. Hollander said it sounded as if Hurst knew something that Hollander didn't know. (I tried to reach Hurst by phone for this story, but my calls were not returned.) Hurst also texted Hollander several pictures of herself in skimpy clothing and suggestive poses. Hollander informed Sprinkel about the call and the text messages and offered to forward them to Sprinkel. \"Yes, please send them,\" Sprinkel texted Hollander on August 14. \"Why on earth is she doing this? Is it because of the election? Like I said, it's not like a forthcoming changing of the guard magically makes the case disappear from the consideration of the Fulton County D.A.'s Office.\"The DA's office released the text message chain between Sprinkel and Hollander in response to CNN's open-records request.\"She has no reason to believe [that the investigation is closed] other than the recent election results, which aren't nearly as relevant to the investigation as she believes,\" Sprinkel wrote to Hollander, referring to Hurst. \"So don't worry about it -- the investigation continues...\"Two days later, Hollander texted Sprinkel to ask why he hadn't called her back.\"I'm sorry about these issues with Candice, and no, I haven't walked away - I would absolutely tell you if we ended the investigation,\" Sprinkel wrote on August 24. \"Right now, however, my Supervisor, Adam Abbate (he was in the meeting with Thomas earlier this year), has ordered me to attend to the recent influx of homicides in Atlanta. Basically he wants me to get these cases ready for Grand Jury presentment whenever the court re-opens. So special investigations, such as this, will be addressed on the resumption of normal operations. This isn't too much of a deviation from where I was previously - my investigatory powers are greatly reduced without a sitting Grand Jury to which I may Subpoena witnesses.\"Something appeared to change after that. From August to the following January, according to the text chain released by the DA's office, Hollander wrote to Sprinkel more than 40 times. But Sprinkel never replied again.Meanwhile, the situation kept getting worse for Sprinkel's boss. In September, Howard's spokesman confirmed that Howard had received a federal grand jury subpoena for records related to his compensation. (Howard denied wrongdoing; the Justice Department did not respond to a request for information on the case.)I tried to assess the situation. Would Sprinkel lose his job when the new DA took over? Where would that leave the James Brown matter? Hoping to gain some insight, I wrote a note and mailed it to Sprinkel's home address. He did not reply.When I reached Howard by phone in August 2021, after he'd left the DA's office and gone into private law practice, he did not sound like the same man who met with Hollander the previous year.\"I just don't recall,\" Howard said when I asked what became of the Brown investigation. \"I have to say James Brown is not within the scope of my memory or consciousness.\" District Attorney Fani Willis took office on January 1, 2021. She kept Michael Sprinkel on her staff of prosecutors. And she inherited the James Brown matter, which the previous DA had left unresolved. On January 26, Jacque Hollander called to ask about the case and the green plastic bin she'd left in Howard's care. She was transferred to Chief of Investigations Capers Green, who emailed Sprinkel just before noon:  A long email chain ensued, during which an investigator said the bin was still in an evidence room. Eventually Sprinkel gave several high-ranking colleagues a summary of the case.He did not mention Marvin Crawford, the doctor who treated Brown and said he was \"highly suspicious that somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death.\" He did not mention that Hollander had given him 1,256 pages of text messages from her iPhone. He did not tell his colleagues that the green plastic bin contained the \"James Brown duffle bag\" that Hurst referred to in one of the text messages on Hollander's phone, or that Hurst wrote it contained \"the dope he was doing the last week of his life,\" or that she wrote, \"Everything will look so wrong.\"Instead, Sprinkel wrote that after he'd spoken with Hollander for \"probably 10+ hours,\" he didn't have \"reasonable suspicion that a crime occurred.\" He continued: \"This will make getting James Brown's medical records difficult because we don't have P.C. (probable cause) for a search warrant, and we can't even get them with a Subpoena (not that the hospital would likely honor one if we tried). This is because I can't articulate a crime to form the basis of a theoretical indictment, which must necessarily back the Subpoena.\"Building a criminal case in Brown's death would be difficult given the passage of time, the death certificate that cited natural causes, and questions about chain of custody with regard to potential evidence. In 2020, Tom Ruocco, then-chairman of the police investigative operations committee at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, spoke with me after reading CNN's story on Brown's death. Ruocco said, \"Somebody's going to have to find that piece that's going to blow open this whole thing.\"By early 2021, such a breakthrough seemed unlikely. In his email to colleagues on January 26, Sprinkel wrote that after he received the letter I mailed to his home, \"I reached out to our P.R. guy at that time and was told not to respond to the reporter and because of this case getting media attention, to not do anything until further notice. So I've put the case on the back burner for the time being.\"Here was a potential explanation for Sprinkel's sudden unresponsiveness to Jacque Hollander. But I've never heard of a media spokesman with the power to tell a prosecutor to stop investigating a case. Nor is it plausible that an investigation would shut down because of media attention; if so, no high-profile case would ever be resolved.I asked Sprinkel and the DA's office for the name of \"P.R. guy\" mentioned in Sprinkel's email, but I've gotten no response. I also called and emailed a spokesman who worked for Paul Howard at that time to ask for his recollections on this episode, but I have not heard back. Even after Sprinkel sent the email saying he didn't have reasonable suspicion, others in the DA's office showed potential interest in the case. Deputy Chief Investigator Michael Green sent an email in February 2021 asking Sprinkel to type his handwritten notes from the 2020 meeting between Howard and Hollander and send them along. Sprinkel complied.It's not clear what Green did with the information. The batch of emails I received from the DA's office includes nothing from the ensuing three months.In May 2021, Jacque Hollander told me yet another odd story: For the second time in about nine months, someone close to Brown had called to taunt her.This time, she said, it was a series of phone calls from . He also goes by Christian St. John, Van St. John, and Christian Van St. John, among other names. In 2018, a police detective in metro Atlanta tried and failed to discover his true identity. Ghost has called me several times as well. He claims to be related to James Brown. In 2016, he sent Hollander a text message that indicated he knew something about Brown's death. He asked her about \"the lace poisoning\" that was \"used to poison him.\"Hollander said Ghost called her again on May 25, 2021. The calls were disturbing enough that she filed a report with her local police department. She says he told her, \"You and Lake are f---ing liars and you're going to burn in hell,\" and \"the district attorney is doing nothing, because she knows you're both pieces of s---.\"Two days later, there was a brief flurry of activity at the DA's office. Deputy Chief Operating Officer Dexter Q. Bond Jr. emailed Sprinkel with the subject line \"James Brown Case\" and asked whether or not there was a police report. Sprinkel wrote back, \"Are you referring to the James Brown that was a famous musical artist?\" About an hour later, Sprinkel forwarded the email chain from January — which included his summary of the case — to four other colleagues, including Executive District Attorney George Jenkins, who replied, \"Thanks Mike for the update...\"What investigators did next is unknown. Some requested emails were missing from the trove of documents the DA's office gave me. Geary provided no emails from District Attorney Fani Willis, even though I emailed her about the case in March 2021 and a copy of that email should have appeared in the search.On October 11, 2021, Sprinkel submitted a memo on the case. I don't know what it said. According to Geary, the memo contains confidential legal conclusions that are not subject to the Georgia Open Records Act.But that Sprinkel memo was cited in another memo I did receive. This one was dated October 28. Deputy District Attorney Adriane Love wrote to DA Fani Willis, \"My review of the facts of and basis for the inquiry, and of the memorandum of Chief Sr. ADA Sprinkel, has led me to conclude that there is an insufficient basis for the initiation of a Grand Jury investigation into the death of Mr. Brown.\"According to Geary, the district attorney accepted Love's recommendation to close the case.Now, two years after Jacque Hollander visited District Attorney Paul Howard, she does not have the green plastic bin. She said she made repeated inquiries to the DA's office, but no one would tell her where it was. Her attorney, Bryan Ward, shared with me an email he sent to Sprinkel on February 16 asking for the return of her property. On March 10, Ward got an email from William Chris Clark, assistant chief of evidence for the DA's office.\"We have shipped the items requested,\" Clark wrote in the email, which Hollander shared with me.Hollander received a cardboard box via FedEx on Monday morning. It weighed 14.65 pounds, according to the FedEx shipping receipt, considerably less than the green plastic bin weighed when Hollander turned it in two years earlier, and the box was smaller than the green plastic bin. I spoke with Hollander after she opened the box. She said many of the items listed on her receipt from the DA's office — including hair rollers, a black stiletto shoe, and clothing — were missing. So were other items not listed on the receipt, including a handwritten note.Hollander told me that most of what she received in 2022 were old newspaper articles that had something to do with James Brown. It appears the DA's office did not send her any of the items that officials had put in evidence bags two years earlier.Even stranger, she said, the box contained two older mobile phones that she did not remember seeing in the green plastic bin when she turned it in. The phones' batteries had been removed, she said, but they had small red lights that were glowing red.\"There is something very wrong here,\" Hollander said.There was no inventory letter from the DA's office or any explanation for the missing items. I made inquiries with spokesman Jeff DiSantis but did not get a reply. I filed an open-records request for all documents related to the chain of custody for Hollander's items at the DA's office, but legal counsel Don Geary said no such documents existed beyond the original property receipt.\"Don't employees from the DA's office have to sign a log when they handle evidence?\" I wrote back in an email to Geary. \"Isn't there a system for keeping evidence secure?\"\"One would expect,\" Geary replied, \"however, there are no other documents concerning the property.\"Nothing in the case file released to me gives any indication that investigators tried to contact even one of the six people Howard told Hollander they would interview. The documents make no mention of any contact with Daryl Brown, Dr. Marvin Crawford, Candice Hurst, Shana Quinones or Tony Wilson. They do make an indirect reference to Andre White, the friend who said Brown was murdered.White was alive in February 2020, when the inquiry began. I missed a call from him in March of that year, as the pandemic intensified. When I called back, he sounded ill and said he'd called me by accident. Later I found out he was in the hospital that day, March 27, along with his wife, Joyce. They were two of Georgia's early victims of the coronavirus. His wife died April 2.  Mr. White recovered enough to come home, his daughter Racquel later told me, although he was too weak to stand on his own. \"Then all of a sudden he couldn't breathe,\" she said. When I think of Andre White now, I remember something he told me in 2017: \"I'm gonna fight 'til I die trying to find out what happened.\"White died on June 9, 2020, about four months after the DA pledged to look into James Brown's death. His daughter told me that as far as she knew, no one from law enforcement had spoken with him. When I asked what happened to the vial of blood he claimed to have kept, she said, \"Honestly, I don't know.\"At his memorial service, his friend Barbara Mobley, a former Georgia state representative, said this about White: \"By the way, Andre, a close friend of James Brown, never ever accepted the official cause of death reported for James Brown. Not for a second. And seemed pleased when early this year, there was a media report of a re-investigation into Brown's cause of death.\"Jacque Hollander told me she sent Sprinkel a link to a Facebook video of White's memorial service. Their text-message chain confirms this. Which is why it was surprising to read what Sprinkel wrote in an email to colleagues in January 2021, almost a year after the inquiry began and seven months after Andre White's death. \"Perhaps someone can knock on the door of the guy that is believed to have the vial of blood,\" Sprinkel wrote, \"and ask him if he still has it.\"The DA's office closed the file about nine months later, leaving many questions unanswered. Why did Sprinkel seem so interested in July 2020 and so much less interested shortly thereafter? Why didn't he talk to the other people? What happened to the green plastic bin and the items that were in the evidence room? And what really happened to James Brown in the hospital?In 2017, I sat in Andre White's car as he considered this last question. His voice was breaking, and tears came to his eyes. \"How certain are you that someone did kill him?\" I asked. \"Just as sure as you're sittin' in the car,\" he said. In the ongoing story of James Brown's life and death, one mystery always leads to another. I remember another thing White said in the car that summer morning.\"It's just certain things that I have to take to my grave,\" White said.Four years later, he did.",

        "content": "The same damaging storm system that rolled across the Southeast on Friday will continue this weekend, impacting over 50 million people along the East Coast.\"We have potential wind damage and the possibility of very large hail all the way from upstate New York down along the East Coast to northern Florida,\" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. \"The storms to the north will have more hail and the storms to the south will contain more wind. There is also the possibility that few of the strongest storms could produce a tornado or two.\"Fridays storms brought damage to Kentucky, Alabama, and Florida. National Weather Service crews will be out to  Saturday to determine if it was indeed caused by tornadoes. On Saturday, extremely warm temperatures will come into play as well from Charleston, South Carolina, up through Syracuse, New York, where high temperatures will be 10-20 degrees above average. \"A very warm air mass in place for this time of year along the East Coast will feature highs into the 70s and 80s into southern New Jersey,\" the . \"This will help fuel the potential for isolated strong to locally severe thunderstorms.\"Myers cautions that while most of the stronger storms will happen in the daylight hours, some may continue after dark.When tornadoes occur during the day, people are awake, alert, and make a conscious effort to seek out weather alerts. At night, is a different story. This makes it imperative to be sure you have a weather radio, weather app on your phone or any other alerting system to wake you up if you live in an area that is expecting severe storms overnight. Sunday will provide a brief reprieve from severe storms. By Monday, the next round of severe storms will begin to take shape, a multi-day event that will impact nearly a dozen states. The risk of severe storms will stem from a low-pressure system working its way through the Western US this weekend. On Saturday, rain and snow are expected to push in along the coastal regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Rain and snow will shift into the Great Basin/Intermountain West region by the evening, making its way into the Rocky Mountains on Sunday.Valleys can expect up to 1 inch of rain, while the higher elevations of the Cascades and Olympic Mountains will see more than a foot of snow this weekend.By Monday, that system will emerge in the central and southern Plains, areas that will be ripe with the warm and humid conditions necessary to fuel severe storms.\"The severe weather setup is much more pronounced next week with a strong storm system crossing the southern Rockies on Sunday,\" Myers said. \"The system will create widespread wind, hail and tornadoes Monday through Wednesday across the southern Plains and Deep South.\"The system will gradually make its way from Texas to Florida over a three to four-day stretch, which is not very fast. This also means that flooding could be a concern for some states that receive rain over multiple days.",

        "content": "In the parking lot of a refugee reception center just inside Poland, Ukrainian women spoke last week with a bus driver as aid worker Chris Skopec stood nearby.  \"It looks like I'm going to Germany,\" one of the war refugees told Skopec as she laughed hysterically. \"How ridiculous is that?\" Then, the next moment, the woman was weeping, Skopec recalled. Her husband and two sons were still far inside Ukraine, where humanitarian needs were burgeoning amid Russia's bombardment. Here she was, at the first meager waypoint on her migrant journey. And if she took this ride, she'd be headed into the unknown, unsure where she'd even sleep.\"And she got on the bus,\" Skopec, executive vice president of global health for Project HOPE, told CNN. \"That's everyone's story.\" More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began more than three weeks ago, according to the International Organization for Migration, or IOM, and legions more flee to the border every day. Meantime, many more of Ukraine's 45 million residents remain in a country where active conflict has cut off access to basic supplies like medicine.To serve their needs, on March 1 launched an emergency appeal for $1.7 billion. Of that, $1.1 billion would go toward helping 6 million people inside Ukraine over the next three months and nearly $551 million help support Ukrainians who fled to other countries in the region.Aid groups are working now to address the massive humanitarian crisis -- inside Ukraine, along the country's borders and in places of refuge far beyond. At each stage, Ukrainians face distinct needs, aid officials have found, and delivering proper resources at each one is no easy task.The need for medical supplies inside Ukraine is so great that Skopec stopped compiling lists. Every hospital is saying the same thing, he told CNN: \"We're running out of everything.\"He and a Project HOPE team traveled last weekend into Ukraine to deliver a shipment of medical supplies to a 4,000 bed, three-hospital network . Among the supplies were specialized sutures used in a heart transplant the very next day, he said.\"Of course, we can talk a lot about the life we saved there, but this is a country of 45 million,\" he said. \"So, we won't and can't stop with the idea of just helping one person.\"Resupplying health care facilities -- and the doctors, nurses and support staff now doing their jobs in a war zone -- is the principal focus of Project HOPE's efforts inside Ukraine, said Skopec. The 64-year-old organization's mission is supporting health care workers around the world.But as the demand for health care services inside Ukraine is greater than ever, the nation's supply chain has been severely disrupted, Skopec told CNN. He compared the needs to those of  of the Covid-19 pandemic: In Ukraine, health care workers in clinical settings are running out of masks and trauma supplies.Another aid group, Americares, has sent 3 tons of critical medicine and medical supplies to Ukraine, its vice president of emergency programs, Kate Dischino, said in an email. And it's working on getting more.\"We are getting requests from health care facilities in Ukraine running low, or stocked out of, the most essential supplies,\" she said.There's a heavy emphasis on trauma supplies like bandages and antibiotics due to the fighting, with , per the UN Human Rights Office.But there are also people with chronic conditions who need continued access to care and medicine -- and primary care inside Ukraine is functionally nonexistent, Skopec said. For instance, an estimated 2.3 million people in Ukraine, or 7.1% of the population, live with diabetes, . And some 10,000 people in Ukraine depend on dialysis to live,  said in a joint statement.\"Beyond the direct causes of conflict ... you have all of the emergency needs that every population on the earth has,\" Alex Wade, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator told CNN on Monday. \"You have people who need access to insulin, people who need access to dialysis. You have pregnant women who need access to safe deliveries and, who could have complicated pregnancies, need access to surgical services. You have people with serious mental health conditions that need access to mental health services.\"These are all conditions where, if access is interrupted, the condition can deteriorate ... leading to serious complications or death,\" Wade said.And needs extend beyond medicine: Food is the most urgent one now for the Odesa Humanitarian Volunteer Center, said Inga Kordynovska, head of the group that launched after the invasion. On top of supporting locals in the port city, refugees are pouring in from other Ukrainian cities like  and , she said.Still, the nature of the conflict means there are large swathes of Ukraine where it's extremely difficult -- or impossible -- to deliver humanitarian aid.Ukrainians escaping active conflict flee to the nation's borders, where their needs are distinct from those inside the war zone -- but just as pressing. Many tell similar stories: They left their homes on short notice, grabbing what they could and embarking on dayslong journeys. Some ran out of fuel or found it heavily rationed. At the border, they faced lengthy waits to cross.\"They're coming across exhausted, scared, angry,\" Skopec said. Some have medical problems that must be addressed immediately: exhaustion, dehydration or gastrointestinal problems. Project HOPE buys and distributes medical supplies to clinics and temporary shelters that receive refugees, Skopec said. It also provides hygiene kits to support public health -- and refugees' dignity.At border crossings to Poland and Romania, humanitarian workers support a refugee population still in transit, Skopec said. They move on quickly, getting tickets for buses or trains to take them further into Europe. More than 200,000 people entered Romania from Ukraine between February 24 and Wednesday, . The Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs' state secretary on Tuesday put that number at 425,000, saying most had moved on to other countries.Aid workers at border crossings register refugees so assistance can be better targeted to their needs -- a challenge in itself. CARE International is among aid partners working within existing civil infrastructure to register refugees, particularly those with extra vulnerabilities, and share it with other vetted organizations, like resettlement agencies.\"In the chaos of mass displacement,\" it's difficult to register everyone, CARE's humanitarian communications coordinator, Lucy Beck, told CNN from Isaccea, Romania, along the Danube River at the Ukraine border. \"So the aim is really to put in place systems and registration to catch as many people as possible.\"CARE's focus on women and girls is also key: 9 in 10 fleeing violence in Ukraine are women and children, . Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are banned from leaving the country and must stay to help fight the Russian invasion.Part of CARE's mandate is protecting women and girls from gender-based violence, like rape or trafficking -- a risk as they move from one country to the next, Beck said. For example, many people have offered transportation to refugees, and while that's generous, it could also open refugees up to trafficking.\"There may be predatory people who will be taking some of these women and girls away,\" UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths told CNN. \"That's an added, indecent part of this terrible conflict.\"In Sighet, another Romanian border city, anyone offering refugees transport must register with aid workers so they -- like the refugees they're ferrying -- can be kept track of, Beck said. Meantime, vulnerable people, like unaccompanied children, are given specialized transportation services, she said.Volunteers and translators doing this work interact with a huge volume of people, Beck said. Needed, too, are counselors and social experts who can support those in distress or confused to keep them away from potentially dangerous situations.Border crossings are also filled with tearful goodbyes, and it's not just men. Beck met a 22-year-old woman who dropped off her 84-year-old grandparent at the border -- and then went back, she recalled.\"She was absolutely turning around straightaway to go back and volunteer,\" Beck said. \"Should it come that she (is) needed to fight, she was willing to do whatever it took, I guess, to stay and help the people in Ukraine rather than choosing to leave and go somewhere safe.\"Refugees are not just working to overcome short-term challenges -- they're faced with medium- and long-term needs, as well. And the shock of leaving their homes on such short notice could reverberate for years. Warsaw alone had welcomed 300,000 people in the two weeks that ended Tuesday, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said. The city, he said, will help refugees, \"but we are slowly becoming overwhelmed, and that's why we make a plea for help.\"\"If you think about all the things that you do as a normal person in your hometown, all of those things need to be ... recreated for people in another country,\" Beck said. Adults need to jobs and language skills to help to find employment; children need school.Of the more than 3 million refugees who have fled Ukraine, Poland has by far received the most, at more than 1.8 million as of Wednesday, per the IOM. Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, Lithuania and countries even further west, including Hungary, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Portugal and the Netherlands, among many others, officials from those countries have said. Refugees have also arrived in Italy,  from Lviv got a warm welcome from their Italian classmates after arriving to live with their grandmother.Refugees also need continued medical care, and the mass displacement has prompted a disruption in care for chronic diseases like HIV and tuberculosis, Doctors without Borders' emergency program manager, Kate White, told CNN. Medications for these conditions might be available for free or cheaply in Ukraine but are more expensive in other countries, she said.\"There is going to be a significant burden, either on the individual or on the government that welcome this population to ensure that they can have continuity of care,\" White said.Already, for instance, 16 Ukrainian patients whose treatment was interrupted by the invasion are getting care in Italy, the country's Civil Protection Department said Monday. Among them are nine pediatric patients in the Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions.And Krakow Children's Hospital, which has had a decadeslong partnership with Project HOPE, is moving to open a separate ward for Ukrainian children, with Project HOPE contributing supplies and pharmaceuticals and installing equipment, Skopec said.For, aid organizations need monetary donations more than relief supplies. As well-meaning as the donation of medical supplies, hygiene kits and other items might be, money allows humanitarian groups to most efficiently direct their resources, Skopec said.With cash, organizations like CARE \"can look at that short-, medium- and long-term assistance,\" Beck said, \"and working with all the other NGOs and UN, identify the gaps in those different areas and sectors, so that we can work together to make sure everything's covered across different needs.\"CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

Our deepest sympathies go to the soldiers' families, relatives and fellow soldiers in their unit,\" he added. The MV-22B Osprey aircraft, assigned to the II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) US military unit, was \"on a training mission in Nordland County, northern Norway on Friday\" with a crew of four, the Norwegian Armed Forces said.The aircraft was spotted from a rescue helicopter, and appeared to have crashed in the municipality of Beiarn, Nordland Police chief of staff, Bent Arne Eilertsen, told public broadcaster NRK on Saturday. The craft appeared to have \"major damage,\" Eilertsen said. \"What we have been told is that it is an American plane with Americans on board,\" Eilertsen added. The U.S. Marine Corps said four Marines were involved in an accident involving an MV-22B Osprey during a training mission in Norway on Friday but did not elaborate further on their status, or their identities pending notification to their families.  \"Though the nature of military service is inherently dangerous, the safety of our Marines, Sailors, Allies and partners is our top priority. Our hearts go out to the families affected by these events. The incident is currently under investigation by both Norwegian and U.S. organizations,\" the Marine Corps said in a statement.\"Norwegian civil authorities took the lead in search and rescue efforts, and we are grateful for their professional commitment to our enduring relationship. We are immensely grateful for the support of all first responders, the Norwegian Armed Forces, and Allies and partners that contributed various assets and people in the ongoing efforts,\" the statement also said.Earlier the Marine Corps said the aircraft was participating in Exercise Cold Response 2022. , Cold Response 2022 is a long-planned exercise bringing together NATO allies and their partners which aims to test their ability to work together in cold weather conditions. \"This year's exercise was announced over eight months ago,\" the NATO site said. \"It is not linked to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, which NATO is responding to with preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory measures.\"Bad weather means search crews need to access the site by land, with rescuers using snowmobiles to reach the scene, according to Eilertsen. \"Precipitation, avalanche danger, wind and darkness make such a rescue operation demanding,\" Eilertsen said. The aircraft was reported missing at 6:26 p.m. local time Friday while heading toward the town of Bodø, located north of the Arctic Circle, the Norwegian Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC) said in a statement.The aircraft's last known position was by Saltfjellet, a mountainous area of Nordland county, the statement added.The Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority and The National Criminal Investigation Service will arrive in Bodø on Saturday and start their investigation at the town's airport. Due to the poor weather, they will most likely make their way to the crash site on Sunday, according to NRK.CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.",

        "content": "justified the invasion of Ukraine at a rally in Moscow on Friday, where his speech was abruptly cut off on the state TV broadcast in what the Kremlin described as a technical error. Tens of thousands of people waved the Russian flag at the national stadium as they took part in celebrations commemorating the eighth year of Russia's annexation of Crimea -- which is deemed illegal by the Ukrainian government and Speaking from a stage in front of a banner that read, \"For a world without Nazism,\" Putin said Russia \"will definitely implement all our plans\" in Ukraine. \"To spare people from this suffering, from this genocide -- this is the main reason, motive and purpose of the military operation that we launched in the Donbas [an eastern Ukrainian region] and Ukraine,\" he said. Russian state TV later replayed Putin's full speech without problems, but the Kremlin refused to confirm or deny if the event was live or pre-recorded. Putin insisted that national unity was the strongest in a long time, even as many people flee Russia or protest against war in the streets, and as the country  on the global stage.\"The best proof is the way our boys are fighting in this operation: shoulder to shoulder, supporting each other, and if need be, protecting each other like brothers, shielding one another with their bodies on the battlefield. We haven't had this unity for a long time,\" Putin told the crowd.State workers were told by authorities to attend the celebrations. In an invitation given out to teachers in one of Moscow's state schools and obtained by CNN, attendees were told they would have Russian flags and should put white \"Z\" marks on their clothing, a pro-war symbol seen daubed on the country's military vehicles in Ukraine. But not everyone was happy to go. Ekaterina, 26, an elementary school teacher at the school, told CNN that she and her colleagues were asked by their school administration to attend the concert the morning before. She asked only to be identified by her first name.\"I refused to go because this goes against my moral principles and I told them that it is not part of my work contract to attend such events. However, I also have a friend from another school who refused to go and was fired,\" Ekaterina told CNN. CNN could not independently verify that her friend was fired.The hour-and-a-half event featured live music and speeches from high-profile supporters, including RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.Presenters and many in the crowd wore pins on their clothes with an orange and black letter Z. The hosts said \"well done\" when the audience clapped, and Russian pop stars and singers including Polina Gagarina sang tunes at the event. Lyube, believed to be Putin's favorite Russian band, performed patriotic songs about honor, war and sacrifice. Presenters, who accused the West of aggression towards Russia, also introduced Russian Olympic athletes like Dina Averina on stage while the crowd chanted \"Russia, Russia.\"The rally comes at a tense moment for Russia, as its military struggles to capture key cities like Ukraine's capital Kyiv and Western officials estimates the country's troop losses are in the thousands. US and Western intelligence officials have also observed that Russia is having difficulty replacing its forces, which is having a significant impact on troop morale, senior NATO officials said on Wednesday.\"It becomes more evident every day that Putin gravely miscalculated,\" told reporters at the alliance's headquarters on Wednesday night, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose sensitive assessments. \"Russia continues to face difficulties replacing its combat losses, and increasingly seeks to leverage irregular forces, including Russian private military corporations and Syrian fighters.\"But none of that pessimism was evident in Putin's speech on Friday. \"It so happened that the beginning of the operation ... quite by chance coincided with the birthday of one of our outstanding military leaders [and] canonized saints, Fyodor Ushakov, who in his entire brilliant military career did not lose a single battle,\" he told the crowd. \"He once said that these thunderstorms will go to the glory of Russia. So it was then, so it is today, and so it will always be!\"",

        "content": "They were woken in the early hours by the sound of bombs landing within earshot of their apartment in . Like many others, they fled Ukraine, setting off on a to safety.Paulo Fonseca, the former Shakhtar Donetsk and AS Roma football manager, and his Ukrainian wife Katerina, first attempted to flee the country by car, along with their toddler and Katerina's parents.After encountering gridlocked traffic, they were forced to spend another night in the capital inside a hotel bunker, before enduring a 30-hour car journey through Moldova to Romania.   \"It was really very difficult, but I think it's much more difficult for the Ukrainians which continue there in Ukraine where the situation is becoming worse and worse every single day,\" Katerina told CNN Sport's .\"This war is, I believe, one of the cruelest in the story of all of the world, because the soldiers that are killing us, they are talking the same language and it's unbelievable.\"\"We left everything in Ukraine,\" Katerina added, including friends and relatives who have remained in the country, \"All the places that mean so much for us are still there, so my heart is there and my heart is broken for everything.\"More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled in a refugee exodus following Russia's invasion of the country, according to the United Nations. To put that into context, it took six months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013, nearly two years after that country's civil war began.Many cities in Ukraine have been devastated, Katerina said, adding that it was important to stop the war and prevent it from spreading to other European countries.The Fonseca family arrived in Paulo's home country of Portugal on February 28 and are now working with the Portuguese Football Federation as ambassadors of an initiative with Portuguese national football clubs which aims to help Ukrainian refugees find homes and jobs.After his playing career, mainly with Lisbon club Estrela da Amadora, the 49-year old Fonseca first became a manager in Portugal in 2005. He then went on to earn the distinction of best coach in the Ukrainian Premier League in 2016-17 as Shakhtar Donetsk coach, where he won seven trophies in three seasons.\"I'm very proud to be part of this world, to be part of football, what the people in football are doing, it's amazing. But I think we can do more,\" Fonseca told CNN Sport.\"I would like to see the great personalities of football defending the peace in Europe. I think it can be very important,\" he said.During the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League season, Fonseca's Shakhtar Donetsk dealt Pep Guardiola's Manchester City their first defeat in 29 games to progress to the knockout stages.Memorably, he made headlines after that famous victory when he appeared in the post-match press conference dressed as his childhood hero, Zorro.A move to Italy followed and after an almost two-year run with AS Roma, the Portuguese was last year linked with the top jobs at English Premier League clubs Tottenham and Newcastle United.Since ending his time at Roma in May 2021, the manager had engaged in various speaking events in Ukraine. He returned to Ukraine early from a holiday to help his wife and family escape.In an Instagram post announcing the Fonsecas' new roles as ambassadors for the Ukrainian refugee initiative, the former Roma manager added that the Portuguese Football Federation had \"demonstrated that football can and should be used as a tool for social change.\"He appealed to all clubs to join in solidarity with the initiative.Katerina expressed her gratitude for the Portuguese Football Federation, saying: \"They are receiving with open arms our little young players. It is a really big support for the kids, which lost all the happiness in their everyday lives.\"",

        "content": "Many Ukrainians -- more than 3 million and counting -- have fled their country since Russia's invasion, with and hundreds of thousands going to other nearby countries.But only the smallest trickle -- around 690 -- have come to the US as refugees since last October. That means essentially no Ukrainians of those 3 million who left since the war began have come to the US.It's a story of red tape and the broken immigration system, which the Biden administration, despite a desire to welcome refugees, has been unable to change.Americans want to help, if their Google searches are any indication.CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet put together a story to answer the question: .Congress has approved more than $4 billion in , which includes $1.4 billion specifically to help with the refugee crisis.President Joe Biden has pledged to bring refugees to the US.\"I will welcome the Ukrainian refugees,\" he said from the White House on March 11.But it is not currently possible for American families to sponsor Ukrainian refugees, as Shoichet points out.On a stop in Poland, Vice President Kamala Harris met with refugees but would not commit to the US accepting a specific number. Poland's President personally asked her to do more to help Ukrainians unite with family members in the US.Critics say the US should act more quickly to welcome Ukrainians.\"Words matter, actions matter,\" wrote Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, the global Jewish non-profit that protects refugees, for after Harris' trip to Poland. \"When it comes to refugees and leadership, the United States is falling short on both fronts.\"Similarly, in a , CNN commentator Catherine Rampell writes, \"We've done pretty much the bare minimum — that is, we've allowed Ukrainians  here to stay longer. This is little comfort to families stuck in war-torn Ukraine, of course, or those who have fled with little more than the clothes on their backs.\"Welcoming people fleeing a war zone sounds good, but it is a difficult political matter in the US, where immigration and fear of immigrants can turn elections. The US admitted more than 76,000 Afghans -- many of whom had worked for the Americans -- after leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban. Many of those Afghan evacuees were \" with temporary entry status, which is a quicker admission process.Last May, Biden raised the cap on US refugees from the very low 15,000 set by the Trump administration to 62,500 in 2021, in line with the recent past, and then . But those caps are far below ones from the 1980s, when the US welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees each year.Even so, it's unlikely the US will reach that ceiling given the decimated refugee resettlement infrastructure left behind by the Trump administration and the overwhelming demand of the last several months following the fall of Kabul. In addition to people who seek refugee status before coming to the US, there are those who seek asylum at US borders. An order put in place by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention two years ago to stop the spread of Covid-19 -- known as Title 42 -- has essentially closed the US southern border to asylum seekers. Some Ukrainians have been exempted from that order, and a few have been allowed to cross the border with Mexico -- including , as CNN's Priscilla Alvarez wrote about last week.When I asked Alvarez, who has covered immigration for years, why the US can't simply change things around, she said the system is complicated and hard to update quickly.She sent me an email, most of which I've included below:We'll be coming back to this issue since the Ukraine refugee crisis appears to be just getting started.",

        "content": "Wang Jixian didn't set out to become the Chinese voice of resistance in Ukraine. The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia's , simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.\"I'm coming back from buying groceries,\" he said in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open. But his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.\"I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I'll tell them what the real battlefield is,\" he told CNN. His daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine -- a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using \"Nazi\" tactics.In one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, \"These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers -- these are the people.\"But in doing so, he had waded into the middle of , with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia's invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China's highly restricted and censored social media -- something Wang is hoping to change.Wang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting -- so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city's \"artistic atmosphere\" immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.His videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life -- quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.\"Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again,\" he said in one video. \"People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa.\"Other times, he's more impassioned. \"Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun,\" he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. \"Where is the sense in that?\" As these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.\"You don't need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from,\" one popular comment on Douyin read. \"The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people.\"China has tried to , choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying \"all countries' legitimate security concerns\" should be addressed.In a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.\"I don't understand how I 'betrayed' the country,\" Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn't understand China's or Russia's position -- all he knew was that \"every day the city is under fire, many were killed.\"The comments of anonymous online strangers don't bother him -- but they do when it's from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia. He said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: \"Who sent you?\" When Wang insisted he wasn't doing it for money, the staffer replied: \"Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let's block each other.\"That \"really hurt my heart,\" Wang said.Chinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin. He doesn't know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in  he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.After speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.He has received \"countless\" messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.\"I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes,\" he said. \"I see people being calm, I see people brave ... I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed.\"There are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.But for now, Wang has no intention of leaving -- not until \"Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay,\" he said. Apart from his affection for the city, it was a matter of principle, he added: \"I can't stand the act of bullying people in front of my face.\" When he isn't filming videos, Wang provides volunteer support in repairing people's cell phones and assisting the displaced.\"(If) I turned back and left, it would be enough to make me regret for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"I have no interest or desire to leave Ukraine until the war is ended and Ukraine has won.\"",
