        "content": "More pets are being poisoned by marijuana plants and edibles than in the past and some even die, a new study finds.A survey of veterinarians found cases of poisoning occurred most frequently in dogs, but cats, iguanas, ferrets, horses and cockatoos also fell victim to the hallucinogenic effects of marijuana.\"Most cases of cannabis toxicity was via oral route of delivery, by ingesting edibles or discarded joint butts or dried plant materials,\" said study author Jibran Khokhar, an assistant professor in the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.\"It's important to remember our pets are not tiny people. They're very different creatures with different metabolisms and because of that they can have serious outcomes from ingesting marijuana,\" said Dr. Dana Varble, the chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community.\"The effects on a small animal will be much stronger than what you or I might experience,\" said Varble, who was not involved in the study. \"For a dog or cat that really doesn't understand why they might feel a certain way, we certainly see  disorientation, distress and anxiety,\" she said.There's a double danger, she added. Many of today's edibles come packaged in chocolate and fruit flavors, which are very appealing to dogs and even cats, she said. Chocolate, grapes, raisins and citrus are toxic to dogs and cats, as is the sweetener xylitol that may be used in marijuana gummies.\"Now we have a dog or cat that's not only suffering from the toxic effects of THC, but also a multi-drug toxicity,\" Varble said. \"That certainly complicates treatment for the animal and adds anxiety and expense for the pet parent.\"The study, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, surveyed veterinarians in Canada and the United States about their experiences with cannabis poisonings after Canada and a number of US states had legalized marijuana.Veterinarians reported a rise in cases, which could be due to increased access to legal marijuana products in some US states and Canada, which legalized cannabis in 2018. It might also be due to more people being willing to report the real reason for their pet's symptoms, Khokhar said.\"When the drug is legalized, more people are going to be willing to report,\" Khokhar said. \"In the past they might have come in with the same issue and said, 'I don't know what happened to my pet.' \"Most people told their veterinarian the exposure happened accidentally, the survey found.\"However, I don't think we can rule out intentional use, either for recreational purposes or medicinal purposes,\" Khokhar said, pointing to videos on social media that show people intentionally giving marijuana to their dogs or cats.\"People may also be giving THC or CBD to their pet for medicinal purposes, but there's a handful of indications that CBD actually works for -- everything else is hooey,\" he said. \"Cannabis-based medicine is not approved for veterinary use.\"The most common symptoms in pets exposed to cannabis included disorientation, lethargy, abnormal or uncoordinated movements such as swaying, lowered heart rate and urinary incontinence.\"The animals peed everywhere,\" Khokhar said. \"And the last was increased sensitivity of the senses -- everything from sensitivity to light, to startling when touched or when they heard a sound.\"Most pets recovered, sometimes after 24 to 48 hours in the vet hospital, the study found. Sixteen dogs died after ingesting marijuana, he said, but \"it's hard to assess whether the death was related to the cannabis itself or other ingredients in the cannabis edible, such as chocolate.\"Pet owners should be extremely cautious about keeping pets away from any product with marijuana, by storing them in locked containers and in places the pet cannot access, Varble said.\"The other thing pet owners have to remember is that those lovely childproof bottles that we keep prescription medications in are not dog-proof,\" she added. \"Anyone who's ever seen a dog chew up a plastic toy or a shoe can see how easily that can happen.\"",

        "content": "Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand's new most expensive sedan.While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand's showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that's $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.This new version also highlights BMW's flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands' electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the companyflexibility to easily produce more -- or fewer -- electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn't risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn't choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don't have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries. The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.\"There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,\" he said, during a meeting with journalists.Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn't much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors', though.) The front passenger seat, if it's unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone's own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.The car's headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series' large \"kidney\" grille can be outlined in lights at night.For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors' Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times. The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla's Summon mode.A sophisticated \"head up display\" which displays data in the car's windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.Performance is a core part of BMW's brand image. For decades, BMW's marketing tagline was: \"The Ultimate Driving Machine.\" Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker's performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car. A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.",

        "content": " stunned the world when he climbed El Capitan  -- and now the  is giving fans a front row seat to his free soloing skills. Honnold is the star of a new two-part virtual reality (VR) series which follows him as he demonstrates his skills on unforgiving mountains in the Dolomites, Italy, and in his familiar stomping ground of the US. Audiences, who require a Meta headset to watch the series, get to see Honnold shimmy up rock faces using just his hands and feet. Look down, and viewers get a very real sense of just how far he is off the ground. \"I'd never done anything in VR, so it seemed like an opportunity to do something new and interesting,\" Honnold told CNN Sport, speaking about the making of the 'Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR.'\"The real highlight of doing VR is that it allows people to really be there.\"Honnold was joined on the adventure by a number climbers, as well as series producer . Griffith had already demonstrated the art of VR in a stunning project focused on Mount Everest, but the opportunity to work with the world-renowned Honnold was an exciting prospect. Griffith had worked with plenty of professional climbers but was impressed with how methodical Honnold was, which helped the producer feel more comfortable filming the sometimes death defying routes. On occasion, Honnold is hanging on to the rock face with one hand, at other times he's seen hanging upside down with nothing between him and the ground.While viewers can enjoy watching stunning sunsets and the beautiful orange light they throw across towering mountains, the series also shows Honnold climbing in the mist and cloud. At one point, viewers are seemingly standing in the clouds as mist rolls in with Honnold climbing in an almost dream-like setting. The show allows for a new appreciation of the strength, flexibility and mental fortitude which has made Honnold such a name. \"They're very thoughtful human beings,\" Griffith told CNN Sport when asked what it was like working with free soloists -- those who climb without ropes. \"And when they go and solo something, they don't just turn up and go crazy on it. There's an awful lot of planning and training and everything else that's gone in before they even set foot on the solo. \"So when you watch people like Alex solo, he's always in control. He's never panicking and terrified. I mean, that really would be terrifying to watch. But he's so calm on the rock when he's soloing. \"He just exudes confidence and chill when he's soloing, so you never panic.\"Griffith had his work cut out trying to capture Honnold and world-class alpinist Nicolas Hojac -- who helped guide the team through the Dolomites.The equipment needed to shoot in virtual reality isn't light and was hauled up and down the rock faces wherever they went. The crew would then hide behind corners or rocks so viewers are left with an unspoilt view of Honnold climbing in these astonishing settings. The camera itself, which weighs around 5.5 kilos, is actually made up of eight different cameras, allowing Griffith to shoot in 3D. Then comes the rigging system which aims to get the camera as far away from the rock face as possible while still keeping the very expensive equipment safe and secure.Griffith said it took the team over a year to mastermind the complex rigging system which can be set up while hanging off the side of a mountain. But the outcome, Honnold says, was worth the extra effort. \"I'm not normally that impressed by soloing footage because, in general, the memory of the experience of something is more powerful than watching it on film,\" he says. \"But the VR experience is pretty close.\"Sharing with my family is the most important thing, having people close to me actually understand what we're doing and where we are and what it feels like.\"My mother-in-law has been watching the film five minutes at a time. She will watch five minutes and get all stressed out and put it away. And then the next day she will watch five more minutes.\"Given his standing, Honnold is asked to feature in numerous projects around the world but, it seems, working in VR with Griffith has captured his imagination. The pair both seem excited about collaborating again and Honnold, named as a producer in the series, has ideas about what could come next. \"I've already floated some ideas to Jonathan,\" he laughed. \"I'm very proud of the final result. I think it's great. You know, honestly, if anybody would have us, I would happily do it again. \"The whole experience was great and I got to do a month of great climbing. I'm very, very pleased with the whole thing and I would happily do more of it.\" Griffith, who spent hours painstakingly going through the footage in post-production, said he'd also be keen after taking a break from such an intense and time consuming project. \"I feel like it'd be really hard now to better it because my brain is just like tons of sponge cake after that project,\" Griffith said. \"But I know, in about two months' time, I'll look back on it and I'll think 'we should have done that better and that could have been better' and I'll get totally psyched to do another one.\"",

One can only express regret here,\" Peskov told a conference call with reporters.\"Considering that Russia is after all a very strong tennis country, our tennis players are in the top lines of the world ranking, the competition itself will suffer from their removal.\"I would like to wish the guys to do everything in order not to lose shape and not lose their world tennis class.\"The ban on Russian players will prevent several high ranked players from competing at the iconic grass court grand slam.Four Russian men, including world number two and reigning U.S Open Champion are currently ranked in the top 30 of the ATP Tour.Russia has five women in the top 40 of the WTA Tour rankings.Belarus' is currently ranked fourth in the world and was a Wimbledon semi-finalist last year whilst compatriot Victoria a former world no.1, is currently ranked No. 18.The AELTC's decision is the first time Russian and Belarusian players have been prohibited from competing in an elite tennis event.Tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion.However, individual players are allowed to compete on the ATP and WTA Tours but not under the name or flag of their countries.\"We believe that today's unilateral decision by Wimbledon and the LTA to exclude players from Russia and Belarus from this year's British grass-court swing is unfair and has the potential to set a damaging precedent for the game,\" said the ATP in a statement.\"Discrimination based on nationality also constitutes a violation of our agreement with Wimbledon that states that player entry is based solely on ATP Rankings. \"Any course of action in response to this decision will now be assessed in consultation with our Board and Member councils.\"On Wednesday, Ukrainian tennis players Marta Kostyuk, Elina Monfils and Lesia Tsurenko called for a total ban of Russian and Belarusian players who fail to denounce Russia's invasion of Ukraine.They posted a addressed to the \"Tennis community\" calling for fellow players to use their platform to speak out. \"As athletes we live a life in the public eye and therefore have an enormous responsibility.

        "content": ".Pterosaurs ruled the skies during the age of the dinosaurs, but scientists have long debated if they actually had feathers. Now we know. Not only did these flying reptiles have feathers, but they could actually control the color of those feathers on a cellular level to create multicolor plumagein a way similar to modern birds,new research has revealed.These color patterns, determined by melanin pigments, may have been used as a way for pterosaur species to communicate with each other. A study detailing these findings published Wednesday in the journal . Researchers analyzed the fossilized headcrest of Tupandactylus imperator, a pterosaur that lived 115 million years ago in Brazil. Upon closer inspection, the paleontologists realized that the bottom of this huge headcrest was rimmed with two kinds of feathers: short, wiry ones that were more similar to hair, as well as fluffier ones that branch like bird feathers.\"We didn't expect to see this at all,\" said lead study author Aude Cincotta, a paleontologist and postdoctoral researcherat the University College Cork in Ireland, in a statement. \"For decades, palaeontologists have argued about whether pterosaurs had feathers,\" Cincotta said. \"The feathers in our specimen close off that debate for good as they are very clearly branched all the way along their length, just like birds today.\"The research team studied the feathers with electron microscopes and were surprised to find preserved melanosomes, or granules of melanin. These granules had different shapes, depending on the types of feathers they were associated with on the pterosaur fossil. Patchy color was also found in the preserved soft tissue.\"In birds today, feather colour is strongly linked to melanosome shape,\" said study coauthor Maria McNamara, professor of paleontology in the University College Cork's School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, in a statement. \"Since the pterosaur feather types had different melanosome shapes, these animals must have had the genetic machinery to control the colours of their feathers. This feature is essential for colour patterning and shows that coloration was a critical feature of even the very earliest feathers.\"Previously, scientists understood that pterosaurs had some kind of whisker-like fluffy covering to help keep them insulated. The new research confirms that this fuzz was actually made from different types of feathers. These feathers and the surrounding skin had different colors, like black, brown, ginger, gray and other tones associated with the different melanin granules.\"This strongly suggests that the pterosaur feathers had different colours,\" McNamara said. \"The presence of this feature in both dinosaurs (including birds) and pterosaurs indicates shared ancestry, where this feature derives from a common ancestor that lived in the Early Triassic (250 million years ago). Colouration was therefore probably an important driving force in the evolution of feathers even in the earliest days of their evolutionary history.\"Some of these colors helped the pterosaurs to share visual signals with one another, but the team isn't quite sure what those signals would have meant. \"We would need to know the precise hue and pattern to work this out,\" McNamara said. \"Unfortunately we can't do either at the moment, with current data. We need to look at melanosomes in feathers across the body to work out whether they were patterned, and we need to figure out whether traces of non-melanin pigments can be detected.\"Tupandactylus was an odd-looking creature, with a wingspan of 16 feet (5 meters) and a huge (albeit lightweight) head with toothless jaws. Its giant crest had irregular blooms of color.\"Perhaps they were used in pre-mating rituals, just as certain birds use colourful tail fans, wings and head crests to attract mates,\" wrote Michael Benton, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, in a News and Views article that published with the study. Benton was not involved in the research.\"Modern birds are renowned for the diversity and complexity of their colourful displays, and for the role of these aspects of sexual selection in bird evolution, and the same might be true for a wide array of extinct animals, including dinosaurs and pterosaurs,\" Benton wrote.The discovery could allow for a better understanding of pterosaurs, which first appeared about 230 million years ago and went extinct along with the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\"This finding opens up opportunities to explore new aspects of pterosaur behaviour, and to revisit previously described specimens for further insights into feather structure and functional evolution,\" McNamara said.The fossil, originally recovered from northeastern Brazil, has been repatriated to its home country thanks to efforts by the scientists and a private donor. \"It is so important that scientifically important fossils such as this are returned to their countries of origin and safely conserved for posterity\" said study coauthor Pascal Godefroit, paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in a statement. \"These fossils can then be made available to scientists for further study and can inspire future generations of scientists through public exhibitions that celebrate our natural heritage\".",

        "content": "Two years ago, \"Parasite\" director Bong Joon Ho called out American audiences. His charge? Americans don't know enough about movies outside their own borders.\"Once you overcome the 1-inch tall barrier of subtitles,\" he said,  for his film, \"you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\"Now, Americans are seemingly consuming more international art than ever before. After winning at the Golden Globes, \"Parasite\" went on to win the biggest award in Hollywood: . Some of Netflix's most-watched shows, like \"Lupin\" or  are from outside the US, dubbed or subtitled in English. And some of this year's most lauded films were international offerings -- Norway's \"The Worst Person in the World\" and Japan's \"Drive My Car.\"Yet one continent has seemingly found itself outside the buzz: Africa. The continent has been  than ever, with 12 countries submitting films to the Oscars in 2021 -- a record. Meanwhile, Nigeria's commercial film industry, \"Nollywood,\" only just began to emerge in the 1990s -- and is now considered . But even as these movies are recognized abroad, recognition in the US has been slower to come. \"Lingui, The Sacred Bonds,\" for example, was Chad's entry to this year's Academy Awards for best international feature and screened at festivals all over the world, including at France's prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Still, for those in the US, the film was difficult to find until the distribution rights were finally purchased by MUBI, thus making it available to stream.\"Just like (cinema) is a big orchestra...I just want a place for everyone to play their own music in the big orchestra,\" Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, the director of \"Lingui,\" told CNN. \"(African filmmakers) should be in the melody of the world.\"The issue, in part, is one of perceptions. Many Hollywood executives thought, and continue to think, that no one is interested in seeing films focused on Black and African people, said Moradewun Adejunmobi, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies African literature and pop culture.She used the success of 2018's \"Black Panther\" as an example. The film, part of a popular American superhero franchise, was expected to do well. But to in one month? Hollywood executives were taken aback, Adejunmobi said.\"It's that lack of imagination, that lack of understanding, that a film looking at a Black-centered world could do well,\" Adejunmobi said.That same lack of imagination is also at play when it comes to movies from the continent. She pointed to the Academy Awards as an example.In 2021, 12 countries in Africa submitted movies to the Oscars' best international feature film category -- the most African countries to ever submit. Ivory Coast's \"Night of the Kings\" made the shortlist, while Tunisia's \"The Man Who Sold His Skin\" received an official nomination, which goes to just five non-US movies per year. This year, 10 countries submitted to the awards. None advanced.In the entire history of the Academy Awards, only three movies from African countries have ever won the best international feature film award. All three movies were directed by White men.\"It's kind of a shame,\" Haroun said. \"A whole continent is just forgotten. I don't understand.\"Just the way the award is set up makes it difficult for movies from Africa to compete, said Mamadou Dia, director of \"Nafi's Father,\" Senegal's entry for the 2021 awards. Everything -- from hiring a publicist, to navigate the ins and outs of Academy voting, to advertising the movie -- adds up, he explained. The Oscar run for \"Nafi's Father\" cost Dia tens of thousands for the first phase alone, a cost he hadn't expected. Films submitted to the Oscars also require a commercial release -- something not every filmmaker in Africa can afford, especially considering some countries don't actually have that many theaters. Dia rented a van, bought a projector and screen, and drove the movie around the country to play. In Matam, his hometown and where the movie was shot, some people had never seen a screen so big.Spending all that money on an Oscars run is hard to justify, though, especially when that money could instead go toward financing another film. But the Oscars are a path into the US market. The awards were a chance to show everyone that a movie from Senegal -- with no co-productions in Europe, shot in Dia's small hometown of Matam and completely in Fulah, the local language -- could make it all the way to Dolby Theatre. To Dia, that was worth a shot.\"All the major festivals of the world, most of the time, they pick one movie from Africa and they say 'That's it, we have enough,'\" Dia said. \"That's bullsh*t. Africa is 54 different states and countries and more than 2,000 different languages. You cannot just put us into a box.\"Yet that's what much of US entertainment has done. Depictions of Africa on TV are broadly negative, a  from the University of Southern California found, with viewers twice as likely to see negative depictions of the continent than positive ones. That is, of course, if the continent was ever mentioned. On the film festival level though, Haroun noted that movies from Africa do receive recognition. Chuko Esiri, who co-directed \"Eyimofe\" with brother Arie, told CNN he didn't think there was a discernible difference in how their movie was received in the United States, having festivals in San Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia, as well as the NAACP Image Awards. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was borderline impossible to find African movies. Film industries in African countries were much smaller than Hollywood, with far fewer films being made, and the technology wasn't the same back then, Adejunmobi said.There were no DVDs or streaming services where movies from around the world were easily available to anyone.California Newsreel, a small nonprofit film distribution company, did regularly distribute movies from Senegal, Adejunmobi said. But those outside of academic circles may not have known about the nonprofit and, simply put, the interest wasn't there. These days, with DVDs and YouTube, it's easier and cheaper to both make and distribute movies.\"Almost everywhere, it is possible for people to pick up some basic kind of camera, could be an iPhone, and begin to produce and shoot something,\" Adejunmobi said. \"It's easier to produce, easier to shoot and easier to circulate.\"Streaming's business model makes that circulation easier. Mainstream Hollywood's business model relies on tentpole movies that cater to a wide variety of people (think Marvel) -- which makes it difficult for films from Africa to be received in the US, Adejunmobi said. But streaming services require a large, wide-ranging collection that can cater to many different groups. There, film and television from Africa can thrive.It's already happening. Netflix just began production on the third season of \"Blood & Water,\" a South African teen crime show, and distributed a rerelease of Ethiopian director Haile Gerima's landmark film \"Sankofa\" late last year. Hulu has Ivory Coast's \"Night of the Kings.\" Kenya's \"Rafiki,\" a gay love story, is on Showtime. Smaller services are getting in on the action, too -- Criterion Collection will feature Nigeria's \"Eyimofe,\" its first film from the country, and also has two films by Senegalese auteur Ousmane Sembène. In addition to \"Lingui,\" MUBI is also streaming a collection of Haroun's earlier films.Though it can still be difficult to find movies from the continent, even lauded ones, Adejunmobi said the landscape is much better now than in previous decades. Films from Africa can circulate, she said -- just maybe not through the big screen at your favorite neighborhood theater.Still, visibility has its traps. Adejunmobi used \"Tsotsi\" as an example -- the 2005 South African film was the most recent from the continent to win the Academy Award for best foreign language film (as the international category was previously called). The movie, which takes place in the aftermath of apartheid, follows the story of a young gangster who steals a car, only to find a baby inside. It's a \"feel-good movie about race,\" Adejunmobi said, and it ends with a moment of redemption. But there were other movies made at the same time that asked harder questions about South African society and the world. The fact that \"Tsotsi\" became the first film from the continent to win the award in almost 30 years shows that maybe recognition from the US is only given to stories that neatly fit what American audiences want to see.\"I'm kind of ambivalent about when certain African films break out and are given entry in the American cinema space,\" Adejunmobi said. \"Because I feel that they tend to be telling stories that are catering to what maybe certain segments of the American audience want to hear, but they are not necessarily films that are engaging at a harder level, at a more substantive level, with the questions that people in whatever the country it is might be asking.\"On the whole, though, there has been a positive shift, Esiri said.\"I do care very much about American audiences seeing (\"Eyimofe\"),\" he said. \"We make stories to share our culture and people with the world. Film is the easiest way to gain an understanding of the other peoples we share this planet with. More often than not what you discover is that we are, at base, the same.\"Whether Hollywood pays attention, cinema in Africa is growing. IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nigerian movies, has become one of the largest on-demand services for Nigerian movies, despite its beginnings as a YouTube channel. Now, the distributor has become so renowned that Canal+ -- one of the biggest media companies in Europe --Smaller steps are being taken, too. One of the biggest barriers facing many movies coming out of African countries is the weakness of the film market. In countries like Chad or Cameroon, movie theaters are basically nonexistent, Haroun said. Still, his film played in 10 countries the same day, something that he said is very new. If movies from the continent can do well at home first, that could help increase their visibility.\"If you have a film, an African film, which got 1 million people in Africa, (made) $1 million at the box office, I'm sure that everyone will be interested because maybe it will work in another country,\" he said. \"So we have to first build an economy and a real market in Africa, and that will open more doors I think.\"There are still challenges domestically, though, particularly for indie or art house movies, Esiri said. Even in a country like Nigeria, home to a huge commercial film industry, promoting \"Eyimofe\" was difficult.\"The domestic market is saturated with explicitly commercial fare, art house or indie film was an entirely new proposition,\" Esiri said. \"The mechanisms for marketing were not particularly effective and it will be something we shall have to continue to work on.\"And still, too often, movies from the continent are linked to a single auteur rather than a broader industry, Dia said. But now, a whole generation of African filmmakers is emerging, he said, telling stories in ways that feel true using their own traditions, cultures and folktales.That new generation, Haroun said, is tackling social and political issues in fresh ways. He pointed to Mati Diop's \"Atlantique\" as one example, and Dia's work in \"Nafi's Father\" as another. Which is to say: scarcity is not the issue. The art is there.A cinephile culture on the continent is developing, too. The Panafrican Film Festival, commonly known as FESPACO, the Africa Movie Academy Awards, and film festivals in Durban, South Africa, Zanzibar and Egypt all award films from the continent. This, Adejunmobi said, is where the recognition is really coming from. In spite of everything, film in Africa continues to grow. And the work is exquisite -- just see the rich choreography in \"Night of the Kings,\" the soft light of \"Lingui,\" the tension of \"Nafi's Father,\" the challenges in \"Eyimofe\" deliciously depicted in 16mm film. These all just in the last few years. African filmmakers are not waiting for Americans to offer a seat in a section. They're bringing their instruments to the orchestra anyway.",

        "content": "Extreme land use combined with warming temperatures are  in some parts of the world, scientists reported Wednesday.The study, published , identified for the first time a clear and alarming link between the climate crisis and high-intensity agriculture and showed that, in places where those impacts are particularly high, insect abundance has already dropped by nearly 50%, while the number of species has been slashed by 27%.These findings raise huge concerns, according to Charlotte Outhwaite, the lead author on the study and researcher at the University College London, given the important role of insects in local ecosystems, pollination and food production, and noted that losing insects could .\"Three quarters of our crops depend on insect pollinators,\" Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the UK, . \"Crops will begin to fail. We won't have things like strawberries.\"We can't feed 7.5 billion people without insects.\"Outhwaite said their findings \"may only represent the tip of the iceberg,\" because of the limited amount of evidence in some regions. \"But I think there are also a lot of consequences that we probably don't really know because obviously there are so many different kinds of insects,\" Outhwaite told CNN. \"They do so many important things. We just don't have a strong handle on how much we rely on them for certain situations.\"Tom Oliver, a professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, said in a statement that scientists don't yet know when insect populations could reach a point of no return, where their losses would be too great to overcome.\"In terms of a potential tipping point where the loss of insects causes whole ecosystems to collapse, the honest answer is we just don't know when the point of no return is,\" said Oliver, who was not involved in the study. \"We know that you can't just keep losing species without, ultimately, causing a catastrophic outcome.\"He likened the gradual loss to removing rivets from an airplane, which you can't keep doing \"without it eventually falling out of the sky.\"The researchers defined high-intensity agriculture as the kind characterized by the use of chemical pesticides or fertilizers, low crop diversity, large field size or high livestock density, among other things — all of which are relatively common features of modern-day farming.And, scientists say, extreme land use has a compound effect with the climate crisis. Razing natural habitats for agriculture can dramatically alter the area's local climate and trigger temperature extremes. Researchers found substantial declines in insect populations in areas of the world that are much warmer, particularly in the tropics, where Outhwaite noted finding alarming reductions in insect biodiversity. Researchers analyzed data from a 20-year period for more than 6,000 locations and studied nearly 18,000 insect species, including butterflies, moths, dragonflies, grasshoppers and bees. They concluded that in areas with low-intensity agriculture, less climate warming, and a nearby natural habitat, insects only declined by 7%, compared to the 63% decrease in areas with less natural habitat cover.  Many insects rely on plants for shade during sweltering days — the loss of nearby natural habitats could leave them more exposed and vulnerable to warming temperatures. And as climate change advances, scientists say these natural buffers may become less effective.Outhwaite told CNN there are things we can do at an individual level to help stave off this crisis -- planting more native species and wildflowers, reducing pesticides used in gardens and even limiting the frequency of lawn mowing.\"And then, thinking a little bit more broadly about perhaps protecting insects in other areas, it's probably a good idea to think about where the foods that we are buying are being sourced from,\" Outwaite said. \"So if they're being sourced from tropical countries, there's probably going to be a high impact on biodiversity there.\"She also noted that governments have a large role to play in recognizing the impact of trade and food production, and could try to not source food \"from areas which are implementing deforestation.\"\"I think people are becoming more aware now that biodiversity and insects in particular are at risk, but we haven't quite got them into the thoughts and thought processes\" that would result in protective action, Outhewaite said.A recent  underscored how the world's ecosystems are very much connected to human systems. And unless the planet slashes heat-trapping emissions, those systems will continue to see major losses in biodiversity — particularly insects. \"Whether these remaining insects can continue to support ecosystem functioning, or whether they will eventually be lost themselves is still an open question,\" Oliver said. \"Under the precautionary principle, however, it would be best to act now so we don't ever find out about ecosystem collapse by experiencing it.\"",

        "content": "Ever since Covid-19 nearly shut down travel two years ago, US airlines and travelers have been dealing with frustration and uncertainty. They've endured several waves of the virus, government-mandated restrictions on travel and service problems as airlines struggled to staff up for a resurgence in demand. All of this has tested passengers' patience and airlines' balance sheets.Unfortunately, there are more unknowns on the horizon. A new and more dangerous variant of Covid could emerge (there is already a more transmissible form of Omicron spreading); the war in Ukraine could take an even more dangerous turn; or rising interest rates, inflation and oil prices could slow the US and global economies more than expected. We are only about eight weeks into the crisis in Ukraine, but so far, travelers don't appear to be pulling back. In March,  were at 87% of 2019 levels, and many  are reporting no discernable effect as of yet on  for future travel, which remain strong. If these trends continue, this summer will most likely be much like last year's — with crowded planes. But this time the fares will be noticeably higher. For airlines, higher fuel costs will slow their long, bumpy path to financial recovery —  is already one of the most expensive items for airlines. And the sudden run-up in oil prices will feed through to jet fuel prices. US airlines have disclosed estimates of how much a specified increase in  would raise their expenses. The numbers are sobering. For example, a $1 increase in the price per barrel of jet fuel could cost  an extra $95 million over the course of a year, based on its forecast fuel consumption. Meanwhile,  recently estimated that its second quarter 2022 jet fuel would cost $3.20 to $3.35 per gallon, compared with $2.16 in the same period .  Airlines will try to increase ticket prices to offset rising fuel costs. And they are counting on not losing too many customers since other airlines will also likely hike fares to try to offset higher fuel costs. Even Southwest Airlines, which hedges most of its fuel costs, faces other cost pressures, like labor expenses, and may seek to raise fares somewhat.Airlines are probably right to anticipate that passengers won't stop traveling. After all, they know that declining virus counts, the end of  and considerable pent-up demand for travel will probably more than offset geopolitical and inflationary concerns for passengers. And given that airlines are constrained by staff shortages, there will likely not be many empty seats. On top of higher fuel costs, strong demand and limited supply translate to higher fares, though they will not need to be dramatically higher for airlines to offset costlier fuel.  estimated in mid-March that it would need to raise fares $15 to $20 on a typical $200 one-way ticket to cover anticipated higher . And the  more recently that it is \"successfully recapturing higher fuel prices.\" We at S&P Global Ratings don't expect that airlines will be able to fully offset the higher cost of fuel through fare increases (and their earnings will suffer accordingly), but they should be able to recover most of it.Of course, as we all well know after the last couple of years, a lot could change by the time the summer travel season arrives. But right now we're on track for a busy — and pricey — season ahead. ",

The court issued a formal extradition order in a hearing Wednesday, leaving UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to rubber-stamp his transfer to the US after  Assange is able to appeal the decision.He is wanted in the US on 18 criminal charges after WikiLeaks published thousands of classified files and diplomatic cables in 2010. If convicted, Assange faces up to 175 years in prison.Assange joined the hearing virtually from the high security Belmarsh Prison in London, where he has been held since being dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London three years ago. He stated his full name and date of birth. His extradition has been the subject of numerous court dates since his arrest, which took place after Assange sought diplomatic refuge in the embassy for seven years. In January 2021, a magistrates' court ruling found that Assange could not be extradited as it would be \"oppressive,\" by reason of his mental health. But the High Court overturned that decision in December, saying Assange could be extradited on the basis of assurances given by the US government about his treatment there. These included pledges that Assange would not be made the subject of \"special administrative measures,\" nor would he be held at a maximum security prison before or after trial.Assange last month  Stella Moris inside Belmarsh prison.CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Rob Iddiols and Tara John contributed reporting",

        "content": ".Astronomers have discovered a new kind of star explosion called a micronova. Although it may be smaller than the giant supernova explosions that claim the lives of stars, this incendiary event still packs a punch. Each micronova can burn through \"around 3.5 billion Great Pyramids of Giza\" of material (or 20,000,000 trillion kilograms) in just a few hours, according to the researchers. These extremely powerful outbursts can occur on the surface of white dwarfs, or dead stars about as small as our planet, based on observations made by a team of astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert.\"We have discovered and identified for the first time what we are calling a micronova,\"  said lead study author Simone Scaringi, an astronomer and assistant professor at Durham University in the United Kingdom, in a statement. \"The phenomenon challenges our understanding of how thermonuclear explosions in stars occur. We thought we knew this, but this discovery proposes a totally new way to achieve them.\"A study detailing the findings published Wednesday in the journal .White dwarf stars that are found paired with other stars draw hydrogen from their companions, like zombies feeding on their fellow stars. When the gas encounters the piping hot surface of the white dwarf, the hydrogen atoms fuse into helium, triggering an explosion. These events are known as novae.\"Such detonations make the entire surface of the white dwarf burn and shine brightly for several weeks,\" said study coauthor Nathalie Degenaar, an astronomer and assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam, in a statement. Micronovae are smaller than typical novae and only last for a few hours. Micronovae explosions occur on white dwarfs that have strong magnetic fields, which send material toward the star's poles. This trajectory causes the hydrogen fusion reactions to occur in more localized spots at the magnetic poles.\"This leads to micro-fusion bombs going off, which have about one millionth of the strength of a nova explosion, hence the name micronova,\" said study coauthor Paul Groot, an astronomer and professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands, in a statement.The research team spotted the microexplosions after going through data collected by NASA's planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS mission. The satellite is used to search for exoplanets, but it also surveys nearby stars to search for planets located around them.  \"Looking through astronomical data collected by NASA's TESS, we discovered something unusual: a bright flash of optical light lasting for a few hours. Searching further, we found several similar signals,\" Degenaar said.Two of the micronovae occurred on white dwarfs, and the astronomers followed up on the third using the Very Large Telescope to confirm it was also a white dwarf. This allowed the researchers to declare their observations were the discovery of something new.Now that micronovae are their own class of stellar explosion, the research team hopes to observe more of them to see how common they are -- especially since they challenge the current understanding of star explosions.\"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is. These events may actually be quite common, but because they are so fast they are difficult to catch in action,\" Scaringi said. ",

        "content": "On February 13, hundreds of people gathered at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial center. The crowd was there to see a new club, , play its first-ever football match.The match ended in  after Sporting Lagos equalized as a result of an own goal from Go Round FC, leaving supporters of the new club buzzing with excitement.The club, which currently plays in the Nigerian National League, the country's second-tier, is the brainchild of Shola Akinlade, co-founder and CEO of financial technology company Paystack, which he says was acquired for more than $200 million in 2020 by Irish American financial services company . Akinlade, who is also a tech investor, says he intends for Sporting Lagos to be a platform for community development and social change. Akinlade told CNN that his motivation to create the football club came during a moment of self-reflection in 2021. \"I lost my dad last year and I was looking at my 75-year-old mum, and it occurred to me that I need to build something that has staying power,\" he said. \"Football is one of those things because it is built around communities.\"He says the goal of the club is to use football to create job opportunities for communities in Nigeria, and he plans to find young, untapped talents and train them to excel at the sport. \"There are so many people that are born with these skills, but it doesn't convert to opportunity,\" Akinlade said. \"So I want us to spend the next 30, 40 years building something that helps the next generation of football talents in Nigeria.\"Akinlade pulled in some of his most influential friends as a brain trust -- including ESPN journalist Colin Udoh and sports administrator Godwin Enakhena, both now part of the club's governing body. \"My brain cannot solve all these problems,\" Akinlade said. \"But if I have a lot of powerful brains solving the same problem, it will be helpful. I just shared it around and everyone just came up with their own ideas on how this could work.\"Sporting Lagos currently ranks , after ten games.  In Nigeria, managing a football club is often challenging, and teams have to deal with problems including , , and aNigerian sports journalist Tolu Olasoji says that clubs are mostly owned and run by the government, and are often lacking in structure. As a result, many that are run privately, struggle.\"There is a lack of accountability in football clubs because the government doesn't pay attention to how club money is spent or what football infrastructure to invest in,\" said Olasoji. He added that \"as a private individual in the football league who cares about making a profit or accountability, you will likely stay frustrated by the system.\"Olasoji thinks the lack of structure and accountability in Nigerian football will make things hard for Sporting Lagos, but he says the team is off to a good start. \"He (Akinlade) has some of the best minds in Nigerian football on his team ... and that creates the possibility for it to achieve its objectives,\" he explained.Akinlade, who is the team's main backer, says the club is trying to overcome infrastructure challenges by \"building a football arena with security (and) assisted parking.\" The tech entrepreneur says plans are also underway to create a football academy to train young talent, which he hopes to launch in the next few months, starting with 11 to 15-year-olds. \"We will be getting them the best coaches and sending them to the best schools as a way of developing their talents,\" he added.Sporting Lagos has the support of several other tech-based companies besides Paystack, with its matches sponsored by brands such as Abeg, PiggyVest, Renmoney and Helium Health.Akinlade says a lot of tech-based companies are trying to find new platforms to promote their products and services. Sports, he said, has become one of those places. \"I think for platforms like Abeg and PiggyVest supporting us, it's also about figuring out how to use this as a platform, either for footballers or the football ecosystem,\" he told CNN. Akinlade says his dream for the club is \"to move to the first division of Nigerian football and have players come out of Sporting Lagos play in the World Cup.\"This story has been updated to reflect the reported value of the sale of Paystack.",

He was subsequently discharged from the courtroom.The decision comes just over a week after jurors began deliberating and days after they said , leading Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook to instruct them to continue their deliberations.After the verdict, Franklin County Ohio prosecutor Gary Tyack praised both sides of the case.\"The State of Ohio v. William Husel was carefully tried and prepared by both the Prosecution and the Defense,\" he said. \"The Jury after review of all the evidence was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that William Husel was guilty of any charges submitted to them. We accept the jury verdict.\"Defense attorney Jose Baez celebrated the acquittal and criticized the investigation that led to charges. In a Zoom call with reporters, he said Husel hopes to eventually practice medicine again.\"I can tell you he's incredibly happy and grateful. He wants this time right now to spend with his family,\" Baez said. \"They're incredibly relieved that this nightmare is finally over.\"as prosecutors said he purposely administered excessive doses of fentanyl that caused or sped up the deaths of patients in the intensive care unit from 2015 to 2018. All of the counts also included the lesser charge of attempted murder.\"If you hasten a person's death, even if their death is as sure as the sun is going to rise in the morning, if you hasten that along, you have caused their death under the eyes of the law,\" Franklin County prosecutor David Zeyen said in closing arguments.Baez argued prosecutors had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the doses actually hastened the patients' deaths or that Husel purposely intended to kill the patients.The trial began in February, with over 50 witnesses testifying for the prosecution, including doctors, nurses and administrative employees of Mount Carmel Hospital West, where Husel worked as the night ICU physician.Family members detailed the stories of their loved ones declining quickly once at the hospital, as well as their experiences with Husel and the ICU. Experts also told the court the large fentanyl doses Husel gave to patients caused their deaths and were intended to accelerate the dying process.Despite the accusations, Husel's former colleagues testified that he was a wonderful doctor who was hardworking, fought to save people's lives, was helpful to everyone in the ICU unit and was always there to teach and explain.Husel's defense called just one witness, Dr. Joel Zivot, who studied the medical records of the 14 patients and determined they had severe and unrecoverable illnesses. Zivot also testified that recovery to a normal state of health was not possible for the patients, and he determined underlying medical issues caused their deaths.Husel did not take the stand. His medical license is currently suspended, defense counsel confirmed to CNN.The trial comes almost three years after Husel, 46, was , though 11 of those counts were dismissed pretrial.The Mount Carmel Health System initially said the hospital received a report related to Husel's care on October 25, 2018. The hospital system . In that period, three people died \"after receiving excessive and potentially fatal doses of medication\" ordered by the doctor, the hospital said in a statement.Husel was fired December 5, 2018. That same month, an attorney representing Mount Carmel reached out to the Franklin County prosecutor's office, launching an investigation into Husel.During their initial conversations, the attorney said a doctor -- later identified as Husel -- was \"administering doses of fentanyl at a level that they internally believed were inappropriate and not for a legitimate medical purpose,\" said Ron O'Brien, the Franklin County prosecutor at the time.The investigation found the doses, which ranged from 500 to 2,000 micrograms, \"were designed to hasten the death of the patients that were being treated,\" O'Brien said.Fentanyl is an opioid used to treat patients with chronic severe pain or severe pain after surgery, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

        "content": "The stars of the Los Angeles Lakers featured in the HBO series  have given their verdict to the dramatized version of the team's championship run in the 1980s: Rejected.Former Lakers star, coach and general manager Jerry West has, through his attorney, demanded a retraction and apology over the way that he's depicted in the 10-part series, calling the portrayal \"fiction pretending to be fact — a deliberately false characterization that has caused great distress to Jerry and his family.\"In the statement, West cites a number of former Lakers, both players and those who worked in management, as supporting his contentions.Separately, former Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar used  to write a piece decrying \"Winning Time\" as being \"deliberately dishonest\" and \"drearily dull.\" While the Hall of Fame center stressed that he understood historical dramas take liberties with actual events and that he doesn't have a thin skin when it comes to criticism, he called the characters in the project \"crude stick-figure representations that resemble real people the way Lego Han Solo resembles Harrison Ford.\"As one example, Abdul-Jabbar cited a scene in which his character (played by Solomon Hughes) snaps an expletive at a child actor while filming the movie \"Airplane!,\" which he says never happened.HBO -- which is part of Warner Bros. Discovery, as is CNN -- declined comment regarding the criticism and West's apology demands. The network recently , saying in a statement, \"We can't wait to see how this team will tell the next chapter of this dynasty.\"Abdul-Jabbar singled out producer Adam McKay, who also directed the first episode, writing that while he has enjoyed McKay-directed movies like \"Vice\" and \"The Big Short\" he didn't like suggesting that \"Winning Time\" \"suffers from some of the same shallowness and lazy writing.\"Magic Johnson has also sought to distance himself from the HBO series and will tell his own story in \"They Call Me Magic,\" a four-part documentary premiering this weekend on Apple TV+. Another docuseries devoted to the Lakers, similar to ESPN's Chicago Bulls series \"The Last Dance,\" is coming to Hulu later this year.Starring John C. Reilly as Lakers owner Jerry Buss and Quincy Isaiah as Johnson, the series is based on Jeff Pearlman's book \"Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s.\"",

        "content": "Although a federal judgethe Biden administration's mask mandate for  Monday, some experts say you don't want to throw out your mask just yet. No matter the form of public transportation -- planes, trains, trams, subways, buses or even rideshares -- the spread of Covid-19, but masks work best.\"You can't engineer your way out of a problem like this,\" said , an assistant professor of epidemiology and assistant professor in chemical and environmental engineering at the Yale Institute for Global Health. Someone infected with Covid-19 releases aerosols that contain the coronavirus when they talk, laugh or simply exhale. If the person isn't wearing a mask to block those aerosols, they can hang in the air and be inhaled by other people nearby. Outdoors, viral particles may disperse with even a light wind. But indoors, where there is no wind, particles tend to concentrate and hang around. Good ventilation can help break up the concentration of viral particles, but it can't do everything. \"Ventilation is great, but we know if we are outside, the risks are lower. Being able to re-create the same amount of airflow that you would have with just your natural wind patterns in a confined indoor space that's heavily occupied is incredibly hard to do,\" Pollitt said. \"Outside of putting yourself into, say, a wind tunnel, which obviously wouldn't be comfortable for many reasons or energy-wise, we have to think about what's realistic.\" On public transportation of any kind, a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system sucks in air from outside, treats it and pushes it into the cabin or car. It's a closed-loop system that can pull a little bit of fresh air. A bus or subway car can have 10 to 18 air exchanges per hour on the low side, according to Jim Alosi, a former Massachusetts secretary of transportation who is now a lecturer on transportation policy planning at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning; on the high side, it might have 40 to 50. \"Everything depends on the age of the equipment,\" Alosi said. Older systems are not as efficient as newer ones. Ventilated air that iswell-mixedhas good circulation and is relatively safe, said , an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who has done studies on how the coronavirus spreads in an environment.But when ventilation is not as good, the air is not so well-mixed, and there can be zones inside a room with a higher concentration of particles.\"One can't really predict where these zones are not well-mixed in a room. Really, it's a multidimensional problem, and it's not easy to predict in a not-so-well-mixed room how safe it is to stay for an extended duration of time,\" Mathai said.And if the transportation system wants maximum efficiency to cool or heat the air in a cabin, it can shut off the air intake and use what's already inside,, director of the Fresno State Transportation Institute and an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Geomatics Engineering at California State University, Fresno.\"Buses have filters, just like the ones inside our vehicles,\" Tawfik said. \"But they are not designed for viruses like the coronavirus or the flu virus.\"In May 2020, Tawfik and his team did  to see how a virus could spread through buses with a typical ventilation system. Using nontoxic colored candles and steam, they simulated how air flowed in a variety of buses. They found thatHVAC systems are extremely efficient and hold cool or the warm air inside a bus a lot longer than some may expect. When the team introduced smoke, they saw that it spread in seconds and filled the whole cabin. Even when they opened the doors and introduced fresh air into the HVAC systems, the smoke lingered for minutes. The researchers think the virus behaves like the smoke did and could linger even after an infected person has left a bus. \"These were unpleasant findings, because it means that opening the doors and windows doesn't help much,\" Tawfik said. \"The systems were designed to treat air fast and keep it inside the cabin for a long period of time.\"With another experiment, the team tried to see if they could treat the air to make it safer. They tested the buses with three viruses that were similar to the coronavirus. Cooling the air mitigated an average of about 80% of the viruses, and heating was at about 90%.\"That does not necessarily mean that it's safe, because this 10% is still millions of viruses,\" Tawfik said. For one thing, it's not clear how much of the virus virus it takes to infect someone. HEPA filters mitigated about 94% of the viruses. Ionizers were a little less efficient, but photocatalytic oxidation and UV lights were better. UV lights in the HVAC system removed about 99% of the viruses. Northern California's BART system and New York's Metro system are among those that have introduced some of these technologies during the pandemic.People can catch Covid-19 on planes, especially when an infected person isn't wearing a mask, but a plane's air system is much stronger than one on a bus or train.Airplanes use HEPA filters that can capture about 99% of particles in the air. They also have better air circulation when flying. Air is typically fed in through the top of the cabin, extracted by floor vents, fed through those filters and eventually sent back into the cabin.  bring in air in a top-to-bottom direction about 20 to 30 times per hour, creating a 50-50 mix of outside and recirculated air and reducing the potential spread of the virus. So the risk of getting sick is low, the experts say.However, people are usually on planes a lot longer than they may be on a subway or on a bus, and more time in a crowded plane can increase someone's exposure. When a plane is parked, it does not have that superior circulation.\"Airplane systems are a little similar to bus systems when they are on the ground,\" Tawfik said. That's why  you'll notice the temperature isn't as well-regulated then, and it's also when there isn't the same amount of fresh air circulating. It's then dealing with the same challenges.\"Uber and Lyft have dropped their mask mandates, and many taxi companies have stopped requiring masks.Infection in a car is certainly possible, You can always wear a mask, and some experts suggest opening car windows and keeping talk to a minimum. Keep in mind that shorter rides are also better than longer ones.Alosi said there are things that transportation systems could do to mitigate some of the risk. Trains and buses could run more often so there aren't as many people on board, for instance. He says it could help to require people to show proof of vaccination if they want to get on a train or plane. That probably wouldn't work with subways or buses, though, nor would it fly politically. Alosi thinks public transportation has been unfairly stigmatized. \"If you're not up in arms about people being unmasked in the grocery store, you should chill out about public transit,\" he said. Even before masks were mandatory on public transportation, , mass transit systems don't seem to be major drivers of viral spread.  And although it's not mandatory, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. \"When you spend significant duration indoors, you obviously inhale, and if you have co-occupants who are potentially infected, you can inhale these tiny droplets that can get you sick,\" Mathai said. Ventilation absolutely helps, he said, but protecting yourself can take multiple tools of mitigation.  \"Masks really reduce the momentum of these released aerosol droplets.\"A mask  when others aren't wearing them. \"Just wearing a mask is a such a simple solution to increasing the level of safety,\" Pollitt said. \"Putting one on, it's an easy thing to do.\" ",

But Johnson has thus far declined to resign from his post and, with no general election scheduled until 2024, his fate will ultimately be determined by his own Conservative members of parliament, the only people who can remove him from office prematurely. For now, they seem content with him remaining in Downing Street despite poll after poll showing the public thinks he should resign. Johnson is embroiled in the worst crisis of his premiership after the  for  by attending a 2020 birthday gathering thrown in his honor, in his office, at the height of lockdown. The Conservative party's polling doesn't look too good either, though party sources think on balance Johnson is still more of an electoral asset than a problem. They are aware that this could change if Johnson is issued with another fine by police or more details emerge from the so-called \"Partygate\" scandal. What this means in the medium-term is that Johnson simply has to plough on and avoid the various pitfalls directly in front of him -- which his allies note he has managed to do so far and can continue to do so. The first such pitfall arrives on Thursday, when members of parliament will be able to vote on a motion tabled by the opposition parties that would refer the Prime Minister to a parliamentary committee that would investigate his conduct. Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour party, said: \"We are urging Conservative MPs to do the right thing. To respect the sacrifices that their constituents made during the pandemic.\"Johnson, who has a sizeable parliamentary majority, is expected to survive the vote, but Labour sources are quietly briefing that the motion will be politically toxic for Johnson either way. If Conservative MPs vote against holding the inquiry, Labour will be able to go to their seats at the next election and point out that they voted to protect the Prime Minister from scrutiny.  And there will be another test just weeks down the road: Local elections take place across the country on May 5. While they won't remove Johnson from office, the elections will be an opportunity for voters to send a message of fury straight to Downing Street. While the Conservatives have suffered huge dips in multiple polls ahead of the elections, observers believe it would take a spectacular defeat for Johnson's lawmakers to commit political regicide against Johnson. But it's not out of the question -- and those who have seriously considered removing the Prime Minister from office see the summer as the best time to get rid of him, as it would give a new leader enough time to settle into the job before the next general election. After these elections, the pitfalls are slightly more difficult to predict. At any time, Johnson could be fined again for other gatherings held in Downing Street that broke his own government's laws. And the final report by a senior civil service officer into the Partygate scandal could be so damning that Conservative poll numbers slump even further. However, for the time being, Johnson remains in his job, unwilling to resign and no one is strong enough to force him out. It's frustrating for those who want him gone, but the politics simply make it practically impossible to get rid of Johnson in the immediate future. Whether that is a good thing for Johnson and his party is a different question altogether -- and there are Labour figures who think Johnson fighting the next general election would be preferable to a new, more credible alternative.

        "content": ". on airplanes and other modes of public transportation in the United States following a court ruling that marks a pivotal moment in America's battle against the coronavirus.  A federal judge in Florida struck down the Biden administration's mask mandate on Monday after it was extended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through May 3. The US Surgeon General said last week that part of the reason for the extension was rising Covid-19 cases and the closed settings created by travel. The Justice Department said Tuesday it will appeal the ruling -- but  that the mandate is still necessary to protect public health. Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN that \"mask-wearing on interstate transportation is still an important intervention that's worth continuing.\" \"The biggest concern is, we want people to be safe and we're concerned that we're not through the pandemic yet as much as people want to be, and (Covid-19) rates are starting to tick back up.\" Although the White House confirmed the  while the ruling is being reviewed, it said it still recommends people cover their mouths and noses when traveling.  But if experience from other countries is anything to go by, shifting from \"compulsory\" to \"recommended\" will likely mean most people won't bother. Videos showing air passengers joyfully removing their masks mid-flight when the decision was announced suggest the same. England lifted mask requirements in January, part of its new  strategy. While face coverings remain strongly recommended in many places, including the London Underground system, anecdotal evidence shows the majority of people no longer wear them.  In France, masks are no longer required indoors except on public transport. Judging by the situation in Paris, the divide is clear: Most people still wear masks where they are mandatory but take them off in places that only recommend them. Still, some countries continue to impose strict mask rules.  In , high grade FFP2 masks must still be worn indoors, and anyone not wearing one can be fined up to $450. Individual cities and regions can also bring in outdoor mask mandates in crowded places. In Hong Kong, masks remain mandatory in all public places, including when exercising outside.Face masks offer the most protection against the spread of virus-carrying particles in the air when everyone wears them. But research also suggests that masks can protect the wearer alone, by acting as a barrier between particles and their nose and mouth. Even if everyone around you is maskless, wearing a well-fitted  of infectious particles you could breathe in, according to Chris Cappa, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis who studies aerosol particles and masks.  \"If there were theoretically 100 infectious particles that you were about to breathe in with no mask you would only breathe in five or fewer with the well-fitting N95,\" he said.When the father of CNN's Beijing Bureau chief Steven Jiang raised concerns about his shrinking food supply late last week, the catastrophe brought by  suddenly hit home. \"Will be running out in a few days if no government handout soon,\" he messaged Jiang Thursday. Then, as if anticipating his son's inevitable worry, he added: \"Still have some rice and crackers -- and plenty of coffee.\" It was a startling revelation of the grim reality in China's biggest city and financial hub -- from a member of the generation that lived through the Great Famine and the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that killed millions during the first few decades of the People's Republic, founded in 1949 by Communist revolutionary Mao Zedong. With lockdown measures turning increasingly draconian, a once almost-unthinkable topic has struck a chord with residents in the city and beyond, more so than anything else: People going hungry in Shanghai in 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration last week granted emergency use authorization to the first Covid-19 test that spots . The FDA said the InspectIR Covid-19 Breathalyzer, which is about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, can be used in medical offices and mobile testing sites. It can give results in less than three minutes. The system separates and identifies chemical mixtures to detect five compounds associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  A study of the InspectIR Breathalyzer found that it accurately identified more than 91% of positive samples and nearly 100% of negative samples. Similar sensitivity was found in another study that focused on the Omicron coronavirus variant. However, a positive result should be confirmed with a PCR test, the FDA said. , which involves the virus spreading at a single event on a larger scale than what is typically expected, is still possible and poses a risk.  But at this stage of the pandemic, a large event may not necessarily be an invitation to widespread, unchecked illness -- if people use tools now available to limit risk, according to public health experts. We now have authorized vaccinations that limit illnesses and infections, robust supplies of at-home tests that can indicate whether someone needs to isolate, face masks to wear in high-risk situations and therapeutics that can reduce severe disease, . Taking a home coronavirus test is much more convenient than going to a clinic, but experts say there is one key downside. Positive results from Covid-19 tests administered by medical professionals are ultimately reported and included in official numbers. But there isn't any requirement for people to report their self-test results to health care providers or local public health departments. That means that infection rates are likely much higher than they appear from the official data.

        "content": "The 10-month-old Israeli coalition government is facing its deepest political crisis to date, after weeks of high-profile attacks across Israel, military action in the West Bank, and after Israeli police entered and arrested hundreds at one of  holiest sites.    From its inception, the coalition government had a razor thin margin, made up of a lineup of political parties from the far left to the right wing, including the first Arab party to be an active member of a government coalition.  Because of that diverse makeup, the government said early on that it had no intention of tackling the most contentious issues in Israeli politics. But escalations in recent weeks have placed those issues front and center.  Its one-seat majority in parliament was lost  when Idit Silman, a member of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's own party, defected. The move sent political shockwaves throughout Israel but did not necessarily mean the current government would collapse, especially since the opposition, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, doesn't have the numbers for a majority itself.     But that could be changing. In recent days, during commemorations of both Passover and Ramadan, Israeli police say they arrested more than 300 people at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where police say people throwing rocks and launching fireworks were jeopardizing safe worship. The Palestinian Red Crescent said scores of people were injured by rubber bullets, stun grenades, and police batons. The presence of Israeli police inside the mosque itself became a flashpoint, as it is regarded as offensive to Muslims and puts a strain on a decades-old \"status quo\" agreement about the site. In response, the United Arab List party, also known by its acronym Ra'am, suspended its membership in the coalition to protest what it said was Israeli police violence at the holy site that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims.    \"If the government continues its steps against Al-Quds and its people, Al-Aqsa, its worshipers and its sanctuaries in this holy month, we will submit a collective resignation, and we call on all parties to cooperate with and support this decision,\" party members said in a statement.   For the moment, the action has no immediate consequences -- Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is in recess for a few more weeks and by the time it returns, the party could decide to sit with the coalition once again.     But if even just one member of the UAL party defects from the coalition, Netanyahu could potentially have the numbers in hand to call for a vote to dissolve parliament and trigger new elections, giving him a pathway back to power.     Never before in Israeli history has the fate of a government been in the hands of an Arab, non-Jewish party. Without UAL's support,  would never have taken power. And even before joining the government, party leader Mansour Abbas had said that while he's a proud member of the government with the aim of improving the lives of the approximately 20% of Israel's population that identifies as Arab, he has his own \"red lines\" -- though it remains unclear exactly where those lines are.    \"I said and I continue to say that the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque is a red line in which there is no compromise,\" Abbas wrote in a Facebook post last week. \"This is what I conveyed today in my conversation with the officials with whom I communicated, and I explained to them my position.\"   Apart from Abbas' vaunted leverage in the governing coalition, there are other officials whose influence may be moderating the response of Israeli police. as well. Israeli Minister of Public Security Omer Bar Lev is a member of the left-leaning Labor Party. And Defense Minister Benny Gantz has pushed forward increasing the number of work permits, believing that giving Palestinians more economic opportunity will bring more calm.     In Jerusalem, Israeli officials believe they have shown restraint in policing tactics on Palestinians around the mosque and Old City. Israeli media report police have been more reserved in their responses during clashes than in previous incidents and haven't employed the kind of tactics that inflamed tensions during Ramadan last year, like barring people from gathering at the Damascus Gate plaza.   Israeli officials emphasized that even after the worst of the clashes on Friday, more than 50,000 Muslim worshippers attended prayers at the compound peacefully, although at various points since then Muslim worshippers were blocked from Al Aqsa as police accompanied Jewish groups and foreign tourists on scheduled visits.    The compound is often a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It lies in East Jerusalem, which most of the international community regards as having been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Israel disputes that and claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.     This Ramadan, Israeli restrictions on movement of Palestinians between the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have not been as tight as before for those with Israeli-issued permits.     At the same time though, Israel has launched raids across the West Bank in response to Palestinian attacks, and 14 Palestinians have died since late March in clashes with Israeli security forces or been shot dead by Israeli soldiers for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails or soldiers at a checkpoint.      The real test for the Israeli government will come in early May, when parliament comes back into session. That is when the true fragility of their position will be made clear.    Digital rights watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday it had warned British officials that electronic devices connected to government networks, including some inside the prime minister's office and foreign ministry, appeared to be infected with Israeli-made spy software. It said the government was targeted by the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus, Jordan and India. The UAE foreign ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador to protest the treatment of Palestinians in Jerusalem by Israeli forces, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Turkish authorities jailed a journalist on Tuesday pending trial after he announced hackers had stolen personal information from government websites and shared some of it with him, including President Tayyip Erdogan's ID card, as proof, his lawyer said. This Ramadan, drama went beyond the screen with the premiere of television series \"From the pyramid road to...\" about a love triangle that involves a sultry Egyptian woman and a Kuwaiti couple.  The Saudi state-owned channel MBC's broadcast of  the Kuwaiti family drama is raising eyebrows in the Kuwaiti government and as far away as Egypt.  Written by Kuwaiti writer Hiba Hamada, the show follows the struggle between Abla, a doctor and wife of a wealthy Kuwaiti, and an Egyptian belly dancer trying to drive a wedge between them for self-interest. Kareema, the dancer, is hired to perform at the wedding of Abla's son. After the celebrations, she is unable to return home and stays at Abla's family home, where she tries to seduce her husband.  The show touches on topics deemed controversial in Kuwait such as gender roles and relations and has prompted accusations of stereotyping on social media. In one scene, Abla is shown lecturing her son about men's perceptions of women's clothing, saying women will be harassed in Kuwait no matter what they wear. Egyptians took issue with the portrayal of Egyptian women as dancers chasing after wealthy men from the Gulf.  The controversy led the Kuwaiti ministry of information to distance itself from the show, saying on Twitter that it \"is not produced by a Kuwaiti company, has been filmed outside Kuwait, and is broadcast on platforms outside of Kuwait.\" While the show was filmed in the UAE, the ministry said it will launch an investigation into any scenes that may have been filmed within Kuwait without a permit.

        "content": "Tesla has posted record profits once again, overcoming supply chain issues that have dogged the broader auto industry to blow away Wall Street's forecast for the company for the first quarter of 2022. But the company warned that it is not immune from supply chain problems, which it said limited \"our ability to run our factories at full capacity,\" a situation that will likely persist through the rest of 2022, it added. A recent Covid outbreak and  in China forced it to temporarily  earlier this month.\"Recent Covid-19 outbreaks have been weighing on our supply chain and factory operations,\" Tesla said. \"Furthermore, prices of some raw materials have increased multiple-fold in recent months. The inflationary impact on our cost structure has contributed to adjustments in our product pricing.\"Still, even with supply chain issues the company earned adjusted income of $3.7 billion, much higher than the $2.6 billion forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. It also was more than triple the $1.1 billion it earned on that basis a year ago and 30% higher than the  of $2.9 billion it posted in the fourth quarter of last year.Revenue of $18.8 billion also easily topped forecasts, rising 6% from the fourth quarter sales and 81% from the year ago total. Demand for its cars was so strong that the days supply of vehicles it had available for customers fell to onlythree days.CEO Elon Musk said that despite the company's Shanghai plant being shut down for a couple of weeks in April due to Covid lockdowns there, and several suppliers also having to shut down, he thinks the factory should be able come close to its first quarter production level, if not exceed it.\"Tesla Shanghai ... is coming back with a vengeance,\" Musk told investors on the investor conference call. \"So I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from [Tesla's factory in] Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.\"Musk took time to thank suppliers who he said \"have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.\" And he said the company should be able to produce 1.5 million vehicles this year, a bit better than a 50% increase from its 2021 output. He said he believes the company should be able to continue its 50% annual growth rate \"for the foreseeable future, for basically several of the next years.\"\"Basically, the future is very exciting. I've never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla's future than I am right now,\" he said.Musk also defended recent price increases for its cars. Tesla's cheapest car, a Model 3, , up 34% from three years ago.  Musk said Tesla must raise its prices in the face of higher raw material costs.\"It may seem like maybe we're being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long,\" he said. \"And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year. So our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that that we're aware of and believe will happen over the next 6 to 12 months. \"We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible,\" he added. \"It's been very difficult with ... inflation is at like a 40- or 50-year high. Suppliers are under severe cost pressure. In some cases we're seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% increase in costs from the end of last year.\"Tesla's results are particularly impressive given the current supply chain problems,  said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.\"We believe these 'Cinderella-like' delivery numbers in a brutal supply chain backdrop speaks to an EV demand trajectory that looks quite robust for Tesla heading into the rest of 2022,\" he wrote in a note.Supply chain problems, most notably a , has led to  at virtually all automakers.That has led to tight supplies of vehicles and  for car buyers. Most automakers sell their cars through a network of dealers who are independent businesses, and who buyers paying above the manufacturers' suggested retail price, or what is known as .But Tesla sells its cars only in company-owned stores, putting it in a better to profit from the higher prices it gets for its cars. Shares of Tesla jumped 4% in after-hours trading following the company's earnings report.Musk has gotten a huge amount of attention in recent weeks due to and take it private. There have been whether Musk, who is already CEO of SpaceX as well as Tesla, has the time to take a role overseeing Twitter if he is successful in buying it.

        "content": "Actor Johnny Depp resumed his testimony in a Fairfax, Virginia court in his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard on Wednesday. Depp discussed the changing nature of his relationship with Heard. He accused Heard of name calling and making demeaning comments about him at times in their relationship that would escalate to arguments. \"I was not allowed to be right, not allowed to have a voice,\" Depp said.An argument between the former couple in 2015 ended with Depp seeking medical care for a severed finger after, he claims, Heard threw a bottle of vodka at him.\"She threw the large bottle and it made contact [with his hand] and shattered everywhere,\" Depp testifed. \"Then I looked down and realized that my tip of my finger had been severed.\"\"I don't know what I nervous breakdown feels like,\" Depp added. \"But that's probably the closest I had ever been.\"Heard has denied the claim.In his roughly three-hour testimony on Tuesday, the Oscar-nominated star spoke in detail about Heard's allegations of domestic abuse, his history with substance abuse and his experiences growing up with an abusive mother. \"You slowly realize you're in a relationship with your mother, in a sense,\" Depp testified Wednesday about his dynamic with Heard, comparing the abuse he says he experienced by his mother to Heard's alleged abuse.Depp's attorney asked him why he stayed with Heard as their relationship deteriorated. \"I wanted to try to make it work,\" he said. \"Ms. Heard had spoken of suicide on a couple of occasions, so that also becomes a factor, that's something that lives in the back of your brain,\" Depp said.The actor, known for his work in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, is suing Heard for $50 million over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she wrote about her experience with domestic abuse. She did not name Depp in the piece, but he claims it cost him lucrative film work. Asked on the stand Wednesday what he's lost in light of the allegations, Depp replied, \"Nothing less than everything.\"  \"When the allegations were made, when the allegations were rapidly circling the globe, telling people that I was a drunken, cocaine-fueled menace who beat woman suddenly in my 50s, it's over,\" he said. \"You're done.\" Depp has maintained his innocence and testified that while he and Heard had arguments during their relationship, he has never \"struck a woman.\" In his lengthy second day of testimony, Depp discussed his tattoos, telling the court Heard would make fun of some of them, which he equated to keeping a journal of his life. He referenced a \"Winona forever\" tattoo, which Depp said he got for his former-girlfriend, actress Winona Ryder, but changed it to \"Wino forever\" after they broke up. He said Heard didn't like it.\"I took off the last two letters and had it say 'Wino forever,'\" Depp said, adding, \"I thought through pain comes humor. Humor has to come in there into the pain and that's how you play it out in the mind... so I changed it to 'Wino forever.'\"He said that Heard wanted him to get a tattoo of her own name, which he eventually did.\"And ironically it wasn't long after that that everything started going sideways,\" Depp said. \"I was doing everything I could to bring a smile to her face as opposed to a frown and then the onslaught of whatever problems she was experiencing,\" he said. \"I would try to wake her up with laughter, singing stupid songs in her ear. I generally just tried to keep bringing her mood up. Sometimes it worked, many times it didn't. But I tried.\" Depp gave further details about his use of oxycodone during the time he was with Heard and symptoms of withdrawal he would experience when he went through detox.Depp and Amber met on the set of \"The Rum Diary\" in 2009, married in 2015 and went to a contentious split, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides.The couple settled their divorce in August 2016, releasing a joint statement which read in part, \"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love.\"Heard had been unsuccessful in her attempts to get the suit dismissed. She filed a $100 million defamation countersuit against Depp in 2020, which is ongoing.In 2020, Depp lost a libel case in the UK against News Group Newspapers and Dan Wootton, executive editor of The Sun, over an article that claimed Depp was violent toward Heard during their relationship. The court ruled in the publisher's favor, determining the tabloid's claims were shown to be \"substantially true.\"Chloe Melas, Lisa France and Sandra Gonzalez contributed to this story.",

        "subtitle": "The Justice Department on Wednesday appealed a ruling by a federal judge that struck down the mask mandate for mass transportation, following a recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "content": "The Justice Department on Wednesday  by a federal judge that struck down the mask mandate for mass transportation, following a recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"It is CDC's continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary.  CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC's legal authority to protect public health.\"In the wake of Monday's ruling, the Justice Department had considered whether to fight a court decision that caught much of the administration, airline industry, local public transit departments and everyday Americans off-guard. The appeal means that the administration will head to a higher court to extend the mandate -- despite the fact that many airlines and public transit systems have already decided to make masks optional following the court ruling.The appeal is a risky move that could limit the government's ability to make similar mandates in the future. If the 11th Circuit -- which oversees appellate challenges from Florida, where the federal judge who struck down the mandate sits -- upholds the ruling striking down the mandate, it would be precedent for all the other federal courts in that circuit, which covers the Southeast. A Supreme Court ruling upholding the decision to strike down the mandate would make the judge's conclusions about CDC authority binding nationwide.White House press secretary Jen Psaki, speaking to CNN+'s Chris Wallace Wednesday night, said the appeal was important for preserving the CDC's future public health authority.\"That's important for two reasons: One because we think it's entirely reasonable, as does the Department of Justice, for the CDC, the health and data experts -- health experts most importantly in our administration -- to be able to have that time to evaluate. But also because they want to fight to ensure the CDC's authority and ability to put in mandates in the future remains intact,\" Psaki said.She added: \"We know there's going to be ups and downs in this pandemic, we're all ready for it to be over. But we want to ensure that our public health experts are able to take steps, if needed, in the future.\"Earlier Wednesday, Psaki said as to whether they will wear a mask on an airplane  the federal mask mandate on planes, trains and other public transportation.  \"People are not legally bound to wear masks. So, it is a point in time where it is up to people, it is their choice,\" Psaki told reporters, later adding that the administration continues to recommend \"everyone wear masks on a plane\" per guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.When asked about President Joe Biden's comments Tuesday that people should decide for themselves whether to wear masks on an airplane, Psaki said that Biden \"was answering the question quite literally,\" reiterating that the White House disagrees with the judge's decision and that Biden and others traveling with him would continue to wear a mask in flight.\"We are not implementing the mask mandate because of the court order, which we disagree with, while he is still abiding by CDC guidance. So, we recommend Americans do that across the country. They're still recommending people wear masks on airplanes,\" Psaki said, noting that travelers aboard Air Force One Tuesday on a trip to New Hampshire all wore masks.Psaki said  \"does not actually show that there is a universal view of people getting rid of masks,\" but that that \"doesn't matter\" to the White House as it makes its decisions \"based on public health and data.\"The Biden Justice Department said on Tuesday it would appeal the court ruling that struck down the federal mask mandate for travelers -- but only if the CDC determined the mandate is still necessary to protect public health.Before the Florida judge's ruling, the Biden administration had extended the requirement for masks on planes, trains, and inside airports through May 3. The CDC was set to assess whether the mandate was still needed, and Psaki later suggested that assessment could be finished before May 3.\"I would expect you'll hear from the CDC very soon. And I don't think it's at the end of 15 days, in terms of their expectation and ask for an appeal,\" Psaki said.Pressed on why the Justice Department didn't immediately appeal the ruling or seeking an emergency stay, Psaki pointed to the CDC's need to gather more data on the BA.2 subvariant of Covid-19, the original reason for the extension of the mandate last week.",

Tinkov was among 65 individuals and entities  on March 24 for \"supporting Russia's illegal invasion.\" He owns , TCS Group, and is worth about $3.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Western sanctions have frozen about $300 billion worth of Russia's reserves and plunged the economy into a deep recession. Dozens of global businesses have exited the country, and the European Union has closed its airspace to Russian airlines and aircraft. \"The Kremlin's civil servants are in shock that not only they but also their children won't go to the Mediterranean this summer. Businessmen are trying save what's left of their property,\" he wrote.Referring to the mysterious symbol daubed on Russian tanks that has become a sign of popular support for the war in Russia, Tinkov said there were \"idiots that write the letter Z but there are about 10% idiots in all countries. 90% of Russians are AGAINST this war.\"Switching to English at the end of his post, he called on the West to \"give Mr. Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre.\"\"Please be more rational and humanitarian,\" he added.Tinkov's call for peace follows  from other Russian business leaders.
