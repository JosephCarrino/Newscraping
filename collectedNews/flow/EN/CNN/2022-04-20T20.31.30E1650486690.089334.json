In an emotional seventh minute, which Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described as the \"moment of the game,\" Liverpool supporters sang their club's anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' while United fans applauded. Ronaldo's shirt number at United is seven. A United shirt with the player's name and number was also held up in the away end by the visiting fans, while both sets of players had walked onto the pitch wearing black armbands.

He and his partner Georgina Rodriguez had Monday announced the death of their baby boy, saying it was the \"greatest pain that any parents can feel.\"Ronaldo and Rodriguez were expecting twins. In a statement on social media, the couple said the birth of their baby girl \"gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness.\"Speaking to reporters after the match, Klopp said: \"Pretty sure if you ask anybody about it, my moment of the game, even when it was very important and a great result, was the seventh minute when our people showed pure class.\"The whole stadium together showed pure class, in a moment where we obviously, everybody knew since yesterday, since I heard first time about it, so many things they are much more important in life than football.\"Obviously, we really feel for Cristiano and his family.\"Many  have been posted on social media. United wrote: \"Your pain is our pain. Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time, Cristiano.\"Former Brazil star and three-time World Cup winner Pele said: \"My friend, I send you my prayers and my condolences at this very difficult time.

        "content": " stunned the world when he climbed El Capitan  -- and now the  is giving fans a front row seat to his free soloing skills. Honnold is the star of a new two-part virtual reality (VR) series which follows him as he demonstrates his skills on unforgiving mountains in the Dolomites, Italy, and in his familiar stomping ground of the US. Audiences, who require a Meta headset to watch the series, get to see Honnold shimmy up rock faces using just his hands and feet. Look down, and viewers get a very real sense of just how far he is off the ground. \"I'd never done anything in VR, so it seemed like an opportunity to do something new and interesting,\" Honnold told CNN Sport, speaking about the making of the 'Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR.'\"The real highlight of doing VR is that it allows people to really be there.\"Honnold was joined on the adventure by a number climbers, as well as series producer . Griffith had already demonstrated the art of VR in a stunning project focused on Mount Everest, but the opportunity to work with the world-renowned Honnold was an exciting prospect. Griffith had worked with plenty of professional climbers but was impressed with how methodical Honnold was, which helped the producer feel more comfortable filming the sometimes death defying routes. On occasion, Honnold is hanging on to the rock face with one hand, at other times he's seen hanging upside down with nothing between him and the ground.While viewers can enjoy watching stunning sunsets and the beautiful orange light they throw across towering mountains, the series also shows Honnold climbing in the mist and cloud. At one point, viewers are seemingly standing in the clouds as mist rolls in with Honnold climbing in an almost dream-like setting. The show allows for a new appreciation of the strength, flexibility and mental fortitude which has made Honnold such a name. \"They're very thoughtful human beings,\" Griffith told CNN Sport when asked what it was like working with free soloists -- those who climb without ropes. \"And when they go and solo something, they don't just turn up and go crazy on it. There's an awful lot of planning and training and everything else that's gone in before they even set foot on the solo. \"So when you watch people like Alex solo, he's always in control. He's never panicking and terrified. I mean, that really would be terrifying to watch. But he's so calm on the rock when he's soloing. \"He just exudes confidence and chill when he's soloing, so you never panic.\"Griffith had his work cut out trying to capture Honnold and world-class alpinist Nicolas Hojac -- who helped guide the team through the Dolomites.The equipment needed to shoot in virtual reality isn't light and was hauled up and down the rock faces wherever they went. The crew would then hide behind corners or rocks so viewers are left with an unspoilt view of Honnold climbing in these astonishing settings. The camera itself, which weighs around 5.5 kilos, is actually made up of eight different cameras, allowing Griffith to shoot in 3D. Then comes the rigging system which aims to get the camera as far away from the rock face as possible while still keeping the very expensive equipment safe and secure.Griffith said it took the team over a year to mastermind the complex rigging system which can be set up while hanging off the side of a mountain. But the outcome, Honnold says, was worth the extra effort. \"I'm not normally that impressed by soloing footage because, in general, the memory of the experience of something is more powerful than watching it on film,\" he says. \"But the VR experience is pretty close.\"Sharing with my family is the most important thing, having people close to me actually understand what we're doing and where we are and what it feels like.\"My mother-in-law has been watching the film five minutes at a time. She will watch five minutes and get all stressed out and put it away. And then the next day she will watch five more minutes.\"Given his standing, Honnold is asked to feature in numerous projects around the world but, it seems, working in VR with Griffith has captured his imagination. The pair both seem excited about collaborating again and Honnold, named as a producer in the series, has ideas about what could come next. \"I've already floated some ideas to Jonathan,\" he laughed. \"I'm very proud of the final result. I think it's great. You know, honestly, if anybody would have us, I would happily do it again. \"The whole experience was great and I got to do a month of great climbing. I'm very, very pleased with the whole thing and I would happily do more of it.\" Griffith, who spent hours painstakingly going through the footage in post-production, said he'd also be keen after taking a break from such an intense and time consuming project. \"I feel like it'd be really hard now to better it because my brain is just like tons of sponge cake after that project,\" Griffith said. \"But I know, in about two months' time, I'll look back on it and I'll think 'we should have done that better and that could have been better' and I'll get totally psyched to do another one.\"",

        "content": ".Astronomers have discovered a new kind of star explosion called a micronova. Although it may be smaller than the giant supernova explosions that claim the lives of stars, this incendiary event still packs a punch. Each micronova can burn through \"around 3.5 billion Great Pyramids of Giza\" of material (or 20,000,000 trillion kilograms) in just a few hours, according to the researchers. These extremely powerful outbursts can occur on the surface of white dwarfs, or dead stars about as small as our planet, based on observations made by a team of astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert.\"We have discovered and identified for the first time what we are calling a micronova,\"  said lead study author Simone Scaringi, an astronomer and assistant professor at Durham University in the United Kingdom, in a statement. \"The phenomenon challenges our understanding of how thermonuclear explosions in stars occur. We thought we knew this, but this discovery proposes a totally new way to achieve them.\"A study detailing the findings published Wednesday in the journal .White dwarf stars that are found paired with other stars draw hydrogen from their companions, like zombies feeding on their fellow stars. When the gas encounters the piping hot surface of the white dwarf, the hydrogen atoms fuse into helium, triggering an explosion. These events are known as novae.\"Such detonations make the entire surface of the white dwarf burn and shine brightly for several weeks,\" said study coauthor Nathalie Degenaar, an astronomer and assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam, in a statement. Micronovae are smaller than typical novae and only last for a few hours. Micronovae explosions occur on white dwarfs that have strong magnetic fields, which send material toward the star's poles. This trajectory causes the hydrogen fusion reactions to occur in more localized spots at the magnetic poles.\"This leads to micro-fusion bombs going off, which have about one millionth of the strength of a nova explosion, hence the name micronova,\" said study coauthor Paul Groot, an astronomer and professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands, in a statement.The research team spotted the microexplosions after going through data collected by NASA's planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS mission. The satellite is used to search for exoplanets, but it also surveys nearby stars to search for planets located around them.  \"Looking through astronomical data collected by NASA's TESS, we discovered something unusual: a bright flash of optical light lasting for a few hours. Searching further, we found several similar signals,\" Degenaar said.Two of the micronovae occurred on white dwarfs, and the astronomers followed up on the third using the Very Large Telescope to confirm it was also a white dwarf. This allowed the researchers to declare their observations were the discovery of something new.Now that micronovae are their own class of stellar explosion, the research team hopes to observe more of them to see how common they are -- especially since they challenge the current understanding of star explosions.\"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is. These events may actually be quite common, but because they are so fast they are difficult to catch in action,\" Scaringi said. ",

Discovery, as is CNN -- declined comment regarding the criticism and West's apology demands.

        "content": "On February 13, hundreds of people gathered at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial center. The crowd was there to see a new club, , play its first-ever football match.The match ended in  after Sporting Lagos equalized as a result of an own goal from Go Round FC, leaving supporters of the new club buzzing with excitement.The club, which currently plays in the Nigerian National League, the country's second-tier, is the brainchild of Shola Akinlade, co-founder and CEO of financial technology company Paystack, which he says was acquired for more than $200 million in 2020 by Irish American financial services company . Akinlade, who is also a tech investor, says he intends for Sporting Lagos to be a platform for community development and social change. Akinlade told CNN that his motivation to create the football club came during a moment of self-reflection in 2021. \"I lost my dad last year and I was looking at my 75-year-old mum, and it occurred to me that I need to build something that has staying power,\" he said. \"Football is one of those things because it is built around communities.\"He says the goal of the club is to use football to create job opportunities for communities in Nigeria, and he plans to find young, untapped talents and train them to excel at the sport. \"There are so many people that are born with these skills, but it doesn't convert to opportunity,\" Akinlade said. \"So I want us to spend the next 30, 40 years building something that helps the next generation of football talents in Nigeria.\"Akinlade pulled in some of his most influential friends as a brain trust -- including ESPN journalist Colin Udoh and sports administrator Godwin Enakhena, both now part of the club's governing body. \"My brain cannot solve all these problems,\" Akinlade said. \"But if I have a lot of powerful brains solving the same problem, it will be helpful. I just shared it around and everyone just came up with their own ideas on how this could work.\"Sporting Lagos currently ranks , after ten games.  In Nigeria, managing a football club is often challenging, and teams have to deal with problems including , , and aNigerian sports journalist Tolu Olasoji says that clubs are mostly owned and run by the government, and are often lacking in structure. As a result, many that are run privately, struggle.\"There is a lack of accountability in football clubs because the government doesn't pay attention to how club money is spent or what football infrastructure to invest in,\" said Olasoji. He added that \"as a private individual in the football league who cares about making a profit or accountability, you will likely stay frustrated by the system.\"Olasoji thinks the lack of structure and accountability in Nigerian football will make things hard for Sporting Lagos, but he says the team is off to a good start. \"He (Akinlade) has some of the best minds in Nigerian football on his team ... and that creates the possibility for it to achieve its objectives,\" he explained.Akinlade, who is the team's main backer, says the club is trying to overcome infrastructure challenges by \"building a football arena with security (and) assisted parking.\" The tech entrepreneur says plans are also underway to create a football academy to train young talent, which he hopes to launch in the next few months, starting with 11 to 15-year-olds. \"We will be getting them the best coaches and sending them to the best schools as a way of developing their talents,\" he added.Sporting Lagos has the support of several other tech-based companies besides Paystack, with its matches sponsored by brands such as Abeg, PiggyVest, Renmoney and Helium Health.Akinlade says a lot of tech-based companies are trying to find new platforms to promote their products and services. Sports, he said, has become one of those places. \"I think for platforms like Abeg and PiggyVest supporting us, it's also about figuring out how to use this as a platform, either for footballers or the football ecosystem,\" he told CNN. Akinlade says his dream for the club is \"to move to the first division of Nigerian football and have players come out of Sporting Lagos play in the World Cup.\"This story has been updated to reflect the reported value of the sale of Paystack.",

        "content": "Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand's new most expensive sedan.While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand's showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that's $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.This new version also highlights BMW's flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands' electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the companyflexibility to easily produce more -- or fewer -- electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn't risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn't choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don't have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries. The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.\"There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,\" he said, during a meeting with journalists.Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn't much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors', though.) The front passenger seat, if it's unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone's own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.The car's headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series' large \"kidney\" grille can be outlined in lights at night.For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors' Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times. The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla's Summon mode.A sophisticated \"head up display\" which displays data in the car's windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.Performance is a core part of BMW's brand image. For decades, BMW's marketing tagline was: \"The Ultimate Driving Machine.\" Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker's performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car. A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.",

Americans don't know enough about movies outside their own borders.\"Once you overcome the 1-inch tall barrier of subtitles,\" he said,  for his film, \"you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\"Now, Americans are seemingly consuming more international art than ever before. After winning at the Golden Globes, \"Parasite\" went on to win the biggest award in Hollywood: . Some of Netflix's most-watched shows, like \"Lupin\" or  are from outside the US, dubbed or subtitled in English. And some of this year's most lauded films were international offerings -- Norway's \"The Worst Person in the World\" and Japan's \"Drive My Car.\"Yet one continent has seemingly found itself outside the buzz: Africa. The continent has been  than ever, with 12 countries submitting films to the Oscars in 2021 -- a record. Meanwhile, Nigeria's commercial film industry, \"Nollywood,\" only just began to emerge in the 1990s -- and is now considered . But even as these movies are recognized abroad, recognition in the US has been slower to come. \"Lingui, The Sacred Bonds,\" for example, was Chad's entry to this year's Academy Awards for best international feature and screened at festivals all over the world, including at France's prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Still, for those in the US, the film was difficult to find until the distribution rights were finally purchased by MUBI, thus making it available to stream.\"Just like (cinema) is a big orchestra...I just want a place for everyone to play their own music in the big orchestra,\" Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, the director of \"Lingui,\" told CNN. \"(African filmmakers) should be in the melody of the world.\"The issue, in part, is one of perceptions. Many Hollywood executives thought, and continue to think, that no one is interested in seeing films focused on Black and African people, said Moradewun Adejunmobi, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies African literature and pop culture.She used the success of 2018's \"Black Panther\" as an example. The film, part of a popular American superhero franchise, was expected to do well. But to in one month? Hollywood executives were taken aback, Adejunmobi said.\"It's that lack of imagination, that lack of understanding, that a film looking at a Black-centered world could do well,\" Adejunmobi said.That same lack of imagination is also at play when it comes to movies from the continent. She pointed to the Academy Awards as an example.In 2021, 12 countries in Africa submitted movies to the Oscars' best international feature film category -- the most African countries to ever submit. Ivory Coast's \"Night of the Kings\" made the shortlist, while Tunisia's \"The Man Who Sold His Skin\" received an official nomination, which goes to just five non-US movies per year. This year, 10 countries submitted to the awards. None advanced.In the entire history of the Academy Awards, only three movies from African countries have ever won the best international feature film award. All three movies were directed by White men.\"It's kind of a shame,\" Haroun said. \"A whole continent is just forgotten. I don't understand.\"Just the way the award is set up makes it difficult for movies from Africa to compete, said Mamadou Dia, director of \"Nafi's Father,\" Senegal's entry for the 2021 awards. Everything -- from hiring a publicist, to navigate the ins and outs of Academy voting, to advertising the movie -- adds up, he explained. The Oscar run for \"Nafi's Father\" cost Dia tens of thousands for the first phase alone, a cost he hadn't expected. Films submitted to the Oscars also require a commercial release -- something not every filmmaker in Africa can afford, especially considering some countries don't actually have that many theaters. Dia rented a van, bought a projector and screen, and drove the movie around the country to play. In Matam, his hometown and where the movie was shot, some people had never seen a screen so big.Spending all that money on an Oscars run is hard to justify, though, especially when that money could instead go toward financing another film. But the Oscars are a path into the US market. The awards were a chance to show everyone that a movie from Senegal -- with no co-productions in Europe, shot in Dia's small hometown of Matam and completely in Fulah, the local language -- could make it all the way to Dolby Theatre. To Dia, that was worth a shot.\"All the major festivals of the world, most of the time, they pick one movie from Africa and they say 'That's it, we have enough,'\" Dia said. \"That's bullsh*t. Africa is 54 different states and countries and more than 2,000 different languages. You cannot just put us into a box.\"Yet that's what much of US entertainment has done. Depictions of Africa on TV are broadly negative, a  from the University of Southern California found, with viewers twice as likely to see negative depictions of the continent than positive ones. That is, of course, if the continent was ever mentioned. On the film festival level though, Haroun noted that movies from Africa do receive recognition. Chuko Esiri, who co-directed \"Eyimofe\" with brother Arie, told CNN he didn't think there was a discernible difference in how their movie was received in the United States, having festivals in San Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia, as well as the NAACP Image Awards. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was borderline impossible to find African movies. Film industries in African countries were much smaller than Hollywood, with far fewer films being made, and the technology wasn't the same back then, Adejunmobi said.There were no DVDs or streaming services where movies from around the world were easily available to anyone.California Newsreel, a small nonprofit film distribution company, did regularly distribute movies from Senegal, Adejunmobi said. But those outside of academic circles may not have known about the nonprofit and, simply put, the interest wasn't there. These days, with DVDs and YouTube, it's easier and cheaper to both make and distribute movies.\"Almost everywhere, it is possible for people to pick up some basic kind of camera, could be an iPhone, and begin to produce and shoot something,\" Adejunmobi said. \"It's easier to produce, easier to shoot and easier to circulate.\"Streaming's business model makes that circulation easier. Mainstream Hollywood's business model relies on tentpole movies that cater to a wide variety of people (think Marvel) -- which makes it difficult for films from Africa to be received in the US, Adejunmobi said. But streaming services require a large, wide-ranging collection that can cater to many different groups. There, film and television from Africa can thrive.It's already happening. Netflix just began production on the third season of \"Blood & Water,\" a South African teen crime show, and distributed a rerelease of Ethiopian director Haile Gerima's landmark film \"Sankofa\" late last year. Hulu has Ivory Coast's \"Night of the Kings.\" Kenya's \"Rafiki,\" a gay love story, is on Showtime. Smaller services are getting in on the action, too -- Criterion Collection will feature Nigeria's \"Eyimofe,\" its first film from the country, and also has two films by Senegalese auteur Ousmane Sembène. In addition to \"Lingui,\" MUBI is also streaming a collection of Haroun's earlier films.Though it can still be difficult to find movies from the continent, even lauded ones, Adejunmobi said the landscape is much better now than in previous decades. Films from Africa can circulate, she said -- just maybe not through the big screen at your favorite neighborhood theater.Still, visibility has its traps. Adejunmobi used \"Tsotsi\" as an example -- the 2005 South African film was the most recent from the continent to win the Academy Award for best foreign language film (as the international category was previously called). The movie, which takes place in the aftermath of apartheid, follows the story of a young gangster who steals a car, only to find a baby inside. It's a \"feel-good movie about race,\" Adejunmobi said, and it ends with a moment of redemption. But there were other movies made at the same time that asked harder questions about South African society and the world. The fact that \"Tsotsi\" became the first film from the continent to win the award in almost 30 years shows that maybe recognition from the US is only given to stories that neatly fit what American audiences want to see.\"I'm kind of ambivalent about when certain African films break out and are given entry in the American cinema space,\" Adejunmobi said. \"Because I feel that they tend to be telling stories that are catering to what maybe certain segments of the American audience want to hear, but they are not necessarily films that are engaging at a harder level, at a more substantive level, with the questions that people in whatever the country it is might be asking.\"On the whole, though, there has been a positive shift, Esiri said.\"I do care very much about American audiences seeing (\"Eyimofe\"),\" he said. \"We make stories to share our culture and people with the world. Film is the easiest way to gain an understanding of the other peoples we share this planet with. More often than not what you discover is that we are, at base, the same.\"Whether Hollywood pays attention, cinema in Africa is growing. IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nigerian movies, has become one of the largest on-demand services for Nigerian movies, despite its beginnings as a YouTube channel. Now, the distributor has become so renowned that Canal+ -- one of the biggest media companies in Europe --Smaller steps are being taken, too. One of the biggest barriers facing many movies coming out of African countries is the weakness of the film market. In countries like Chad or Cameroon, movie theaters are basically nonexistent, Haroun said. Still, his film played in 10 countries the same day, something that he said is very new. If movies from the continent can do well at home first, that could help increase their visibility.\"If you have a film, an African film, which got 1 million people in Africa, (made) $1 million at the box office, I'm sure that everyone will be interested because maybe it will work in another country,\" he said. \"So we have to first build an economy and a real market in Africa, and that will open more doors I think.\"There are still challenges domestically, though, particularly for indie or art house movies, Esiri said. Even in a country like Nigeria, home to a huge commercial film industry, promoting \"Eyimofe\" was difficult.\"The domestic market is saturated with explicitly commercial fare, art house or indie film was an entirely new proposition,\" Esiri said. \"The mechanisms for marketing were not particularly effective and it will be something we shall have to continue to work on.\"And still, too often, movies from the continent are linked to a single auteur rather than a broader industry, Dia said. But now, a whole generation of African filmmakers is emerging, he said, telling stories in ways that feel true using their own traditions, cultures and folktales.That new generation, Haroun said, is tackling social and political issues in fresh ways. He pointed to Mati Diop's \"Atlantique\" as one example, and Dia's work in \"Nafi's Father\" as another. Which is to say: scarcity is not the issue. The art is there.A cinephile culture on the continent is developing, too. The Panafrican Film Festival, commonly known as FESPACO, the Africa Movie Academy Awards, and film festivals in Durban, South Africa, Zanzibar and Egypt all award films from the continent. This, Adejunmobi said, is where the recognition is really coming from. In spite of everything, film in Africa continues to grow. And the work is exquisite -- just see the rich choreography in \"Night of the Kings,\" the soft light of \"Lingui,\" the tension of \"Nafi's Father,\" the challenges in \"Eyimofe\" deliciously depicted in 16mm film. These all just in the last few years. African filmmakers are not waiting for Americans to offer a seat in a section. They're bringing their instruments to the orchestra anyway.",

        "content": "When he was first elected French President in 2017, Emmanuel Macron  that over the next five years he would do everything to ensure people would no longer have \"any reason to vote for the extremes.\"Unfortunately for the French electorate, Macron fell short of this promise to stem the rise of the far-right. In the wake of his 2017 victory, the political landscape shifted dramatically, with Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party being the main beneficiary. Now, just days away from France's presidential election on Sunday, Macron again faces Le Pen in a rematch of their 2017 contest -- and this time, Le Pen is riding a late surge in support that puts her a During his first term in office, Macron's administration flirted with the same right-wing themes that have powered Le Pen's rise -- including Islam, security and immigration. Indeed, the entire political landscape in France is not immune to the appeal of policies that have profound effects on anyone who was not born White and on French soil. Whether or not Macron retains his seat, the effects of the creeping acceptance of the premises fueling Le Pen's rise will be profound.The focus on French Muslims, in particular, has been marked by a steady increase in fear-mongering for votes over the past 30 years. As successive waves of terrorist attacks in France galvanized public opinion since the mid-1980s, state authorities have been trying to create a framework to oversee Muslim religious practices and organization, through the idea of creating a But in the past 10 years, the threat has expanded from public safety to include Muslims being seen as an existential threat to the cultural identity of what is being called \"traditional France.\"Seeing an opportunity to ride a wave of discontent, politicians have  instrumentalizing the once liberal concept of laïcité (France's form of secularism), including banning full-face coverings and  in public spaces.While Macron is seen as an alternative to the far-right, he has also attempted to play both sides -- putting on a liberal face for an international audience, while quietly embracing the very policies that the far-right has championed at home. To lead this charge, Macron appointed Gérald Darmanin to the Ministry of Interior, one of the most powerful ministries in France. Darmanin has polarized the electorate with a staunch support for the French police, gaining strong support from influential police unions while alienating much of the left. Furthermore,  accuse Darmanin of playing into anti-Muslim hatred with inflammatory rhetoric and action. In a vivid illustration of the Macron Administration's rightward shift, last year Darmanin accused Le Pen of in the midst of the debate around the Law Strengthening Respect For the Principles of the Republic (Anti-Separatism Law) of August 2021. The anti-separatism bill was part of Macron's strategy ahead of the 2022 presidential election to take some wind out of the far-right's sails. Under the law, non-profit organizations are subject to signing a \"contract of republican commitment\" -- by which they must pledge respect to liberty, equality, fraternity, human dignity and public order. As a result, public authorities can arbitrarily deny, claim reimbursement or withdraw support to associations they deem are not respecting said values.Some associations fear that the heart of their activities (such as providing support to undocumented people, or human rights activist groups denouncing government discriminatory policies) could be deemed a violation of public order -- and as a consequence, lose their funding.Facing a fractured field on the left, analysts predicted Macron was trying to lure some right-leaning voters away from Le Pen by taking action on some of the far right's focal issues. Indeed, Darmanin declared in  that he wished that \"far-right voters would vote for us (Macron's party)\". Meanwhile, Le Pen has done her own version of a face-lift, de-emphasizing the harsher elements of her platform, while refusing to concede the underlying ideology that her party pioneered over the past 30 years. Her  include amending the Constitution to restrict immigration, family reunification and asylum that she deems a threat to France's identity. Le Pen's manifesto also contains measures for a legal distinction between \"native-born French\" and \"others,\" for access to employment or social benefits. Le Pen also announced her intention to  on the wearing of the headscarf in public spaces on the grounds of protecting Laïcité and the 1905 Law on Separation of Church and State. Laïcité has been understood for most of the 20th century as imposing neutrality upon the state and its civil servants, while guaranteeing religious freedom and freedom of conscience for private individualsBut since the 1990s, the understanding of laïcité has evolved and been interpreted as limiting religious expressions, more specifically Muslim ones. This has primarily been implemented through legislation restricting the wearing of visible religious signs, especially the wearing of the headscarf by some Muslim women. Macron sometimes into this narrative, once asking a young French Muslim woman wearing a headscarf if she was wearing a headscarf \"by choice\" or \"by force\" and complimented her when she confirmed it was by choice.While Macron's statement was baffling, as it's unlikely he would have asked such a question to a Catholic nun wearing a veil, a Jew wearing a yarmulke or a Sikh wearing a turban, the President is clearly trying to backpedal from the actions of his administration and pretend measures like the Anti-Separatism Law never happened. Once again, Muslims, and especially Muslim women, are being instrumentalized for electoral purposes. Regardless of who wins the election, the far-right has already won. They are shaping the agenda of French political debate. If Le Pen does not win this time, she or someone like her will most likely win another time.  French Muslims are tired of being pawns in this political game. Muslims comprise an estimated  of France yet take up almost all of the political and media discourse, while their voices are left out of the conversation.  Islam and immigration are topics that the far-right loves to use for their agenda, and unfortunately Macron, and those before him, fell into this trap. If Macron wins, he will have to make amends with those  And he and his administration will have to stop treating their French Muslim citizens as if they were a population that needed to be tamed. There is a need to proactively and constructively engage with Muslims, put in place programs that fight discrimination, and stop weaponizing laïcité as a tool for political identity. Muslims are simply not the threat some politicians and pundits make them out to be. France needs to allow Muslims to be full French citizens on their own terms, to express their identities openly and honestly, in a manner that is both true to their faith yet unambiguously French. Whether or not Macron or Le Pen wins this weekend, there is no doubt that the political landscape is shifting under the feet of French voters. ",

        "content": "Ever since Covid-19 nearly shut down travel two years ago, US airlines and travelers have been dealing with frustration and uncertainty. They've endured several waves of the virus, government-mandated restrictions on travel and service problems as airlines struggled to staff up for a resurgence in demand. All of this has tested passengers' patience and airlines' balance sheets.Unfortunately, there are more unknowns on the horizon. A new and more dangerous variant of Covid could emerge (there is already a more transmissible form of Omicron spreading); the war in Ukraine could take an even more dangerous turn; or rising interest rates, inflation and oil prices could slow the US and global economies more than expected. We are only about eight weeks into the crisis in Ukraine, but so far, travelers don't appear to be pulling back. In March,  were at 87% of 2019 levels, and many  are reporting no discernable effect as of yet on  for future travel, which remain strong. If these trends continue, this summer will most likely be much like last year's — with crowded planes. But this time the fares will be noticeably higher. For airlines, higher fuel costs will slow their long, bumpy path to financial recovery —  is already one of the most expensive items for airlines. And the sudden run-up in oil prices will feed through to jet fuel prices. US airlines have disclosed estimates of how much a specified increase in  would raise their expenses. The numbers are sobering. For example, a $1 increase in the price per barrel of jet fuel could cost  an extra $95 million over the course of a year, based on its forecast fuel consumption. Meanwhile,  recently estimated that its second quarter 2022 jet fuel would cost $3.20 to $3.35 per gallon, compared with $2.16 in the same period .  Airlines will try to increase ticket prices to offset rising fuel costs. And they are counting on not losing too many customers since other airlines will also likely hike fares to try to offset higher fuel costs. Even Southwest Airlines, which hedges most of its fuel costs, faces other cost pressures, like labor expenses, and may seek to raise fares somewhat.Airlines are probably right to anticipate that passengers won't stop traveling. After all, they know that declining virus counts, the end of  and considerable pent-up demand for travel will probably more than offset geopolitical and inflationary concerns for passengers. And given that airlines are constrained by staff shortages, there will likely not be many empty seats. On top of higher fuel costs, strong demand and limited supply translate to higher fares, though they will not need to be dramatically higher for airlines to offset costlier fuel.  estimated in mid-March that it would need to raise fares $15 to $20 on a typical $200 one-way ticket to cover anticipated higher . And the  more recently that it is \"successfully recapturing higher fuel prices.\" We at S&P Global Ratings don't expect that airlines will be able to fully offset the higher cost of fuel through fare increases (and their earnings will suffer accordingly), but they should be able to recover most of it.Of course, as we all well know after the last couple of years, a lot could change by the time the summer travel season arrives. But right now we're on track for a busy — and pricey — season ahead. ",

        "content": "Extreme land use combined with warming temperatures are  in some parts of the world, scientists reported Wednesday.The study, published , identified for the first time a clear and alarming link between the climate crisis and high-intensity agriculture and showed that, in places where those impacts are particularly high, insect abundance has already dropped by nearly 50%, while the number of species has been slashed by 27%.These findings raise huge concerns, according to Charlotte Outhwaite, the lead author on the study and researcher at the University College London, given the important role of insects in local ecosystems, pollination and food production, and noted that losing insects could .\"Three quarters of our crops depend on insect pollinators,\" Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the UK, . \"Crops will begin to fail. We won't have things like strawberries.\"We can't feed 7.5 billion people without insects.\"Outhwaite said their findings \"may only represent the tip of the iceberg,\" because of the limited amount of evidence in some regions. \"But I think there are also a lot of consequences that we probably don't really know because obviously there are so many different kinds of insects,\" Outhwaite told CNN. \"They do so many important things. We just don't have a strong handle on how much we rely on them for certain situations.\"Tom Oliver, a professor of applied ecology at the University of Reading, said in a statement that scientists don't yet know when insect populations could reach a point of no return, where their losses would be too great to overcome.\"In terms of a potential tipping point where the loss of insects causes whole ecosystems to collapse, the honest answer is we just don't know when the point of no return is,\" said Oliver, who was not involved in the study. \"We know that you can't just keep losing species without, ultimately, causing a catastrophic outcome.\"He likened the gradual loss to removing rivets from an airplane, which you can't keep doing \"without it eventually falling out of the sky.\"The researchers defined high-intensity agriculture as the kind characterized by the use of chemical pesticides or fertilizers, low crop diversity, large field size or high livestock density, among other things — all of which are relatively common features of modern-day farming.And, scientists say, extreme land use has a compound effect with the climate crisis. Razing natural habitats for agriculture can dramatically alter the area's local climate and trigger temperature extremes. Researchers found substantial declines in insect populations in areas of the world that are much warmer, particularly in the tropics, where Outhwaite noted finding alarming reductions in insect biodiversity. Researchers analyzed data from a 20-year period for more than 6,000 locations and studied nearly 18,000 insect species, including butterflies, moths, dragonflies, grasshoppers and bees. They concluded that in areas with low-intensity agriculture, less climate warming, and a nearby natural habitat, insects only declined by 7%, compared to the 63% decrease in areas with less natural habitat cover.  Many insects rely on plants for shade during sweltering days — the loss of nearby natural habitats could leave them more exposed and vulnerable to warming temperatures. And as climate change advances, scientists say these natural buffers may become less effective.Outhwaite told CNN there are things we can do at an individual level to help stave off this crisis -- planting more native species and wildflowers, reducing pesticides used in gardens and even limiting the frequency of lawn mowing.\"And then, thinking a little bit more broadly about perhaps protecting insects in other areas, it's probably a good idea to think about where the foods that we are buying are being sourced from,\" Outwaite said. \"So if they're being sourced from tropical countries, there's probably going to be a high impact on biodiversity there.\"She also noted that governments have a large role to play in recognizing the impact of trade and food production, and could try to not source food \"from areas which are implementing deforestation.\"\"I think people are becoming more aware now that biodiversity and insects in particular are at risk, but we haven't quite got them into the thoughts and thought processes\" that would result in protective action, Outhewaite said.A recent  underscored how the world's ecosystems are very much connected to human systems. And unless the planet slashes heat-trapping emissions, those systems will continue to see major losses in biodiversity — particularly insects. \"Whether these remaining insects can continue to support ecosystem functioning, or whether they will eventually be lost themselves is still an open question,\" Oliver said. \"Under the precautionary principle, however, it would be best to act now so we don't ever find out about ecosystem collapse by experiencing it.\"",

        "content": "If your friend has recently lost weight, you might want to tell her how great she looks. Maybe you also say that you wish you had her body or self-control or you ask her how she did it. Perhaps you've been on the receiving end of such a \"compliment\" in the past.Such comments are well meaning but can have unintended negative consequences. \"In that case, we are unintentionally exacerbating or affirming the thin ideal that our society tends to emphasize and idolize,\" said Alvin Tran, an assistant professor of public health at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, who does research on eating disorders and body image. \"We need to be very cautious when we do approach conversations around someone's physical appearance, especially their weight.\" This is especially important when talking to people with eating disorders or serious body image issues, since such remarks can worsen their situation. Compliments about someone's weight loss or thinner body perpetuate society's deep-seated diet culture, Tran said, and the idea that thinness is inherently good. \"We do tend to operate (as if) we can somehow look at people and, based on body size, determine whether they're healthy,\" said Tamara Pryor, a senior fellow and director of research at ED Care, an eating disorder treatment center based in Denver. \"We have people in large bodies that are in a state of malnourishment as well as people in extremely low size that are malnourished, and people that are standard size but still very severely compromised by an eating disorder. People can't look at them and tell that.\" But if you're pleased or wowed by how someone looks, should you not compliment them at all? What is and isn't OK to say? CNN asked for advice from Pryor and Joann Hendelman, the clinical director of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders.   It's intrusive. Whose business is it for us to be passing judgment, particularly expressing it verbally? We might look at people and make judgment calls, but we need to keep it to ourselves. I come from the second wave of the feminist movement, where it was \"my body, my business.\" That still stands to be the case.  If somebody said to me, \"Oh my gosh, you look great. You've lost some weight,\" I would find myself thinking, \"What did you think of me beforehand? Was I not acceptable?\" I could imagine the pressure the receiver would then feel to maintain the lower weight or lose more weight to receive more praise or be accepted. They might think, \"What about me and the essence of who I am as a human being?\" There are both physical consequences and significant psychological consequences that get perpetuated. If you don't get that compliment, then it becomes, \"There's something wrong with me. I'm not good enough.\" Any questions regarding appearance tend to be triggering, and they're more triggering for people with eating disorders, because they have such a heightened sensitivity abouthow they're being judged based on body shape and size. My patient and her mother went to a clothing store. She's extremely low weight and anorexic, and had just started treatment. As she's in the dressing room, her mom gasps, because when she saw her daughter trying on clothes, she realized how extreme the weight loss was. In comes the clerk, who hears the mom say, \"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that your weight had gotten so low. I'm so grateful that you're in treatment now.\" The clerk said, \"Are you kidding? I would die to be that thin. How did you do it?\" So, then the patient has this mixed and conflicted response: She can feel her mother's very real concern, but on the other hand, she's getting complimented.  I have known and worked with people who had cancer or another reason why their bodies were small. For them, compliments are very uncomfortable because they know they have this horrible illness, and yet people are complimenting them on this weight loss that they would give everything not to have. Find ways to engage that don't include commentary on their bodies. If someone needed to lose weight for health reasons, complimenting them on their tenacity in achieving that goal isn't best. Because then it's like, \"Oh, boy, what if I fail or gain some weight back?\" That feels like a lot of pressure. Instead, if someone brings up recent weight loss, ask how they feel about the weight they've lost or what made them do it, rather than making a judgment yourself.  Compliment them on what they're wearing, or say something like, \"Your eyes are so bright today\" -- those kinds of things. If a friend is still so tied to being skinny in order to get compliments, and I say how fantastic that is, I am supporting their focus on their body size and doing them a disservice.  Think about what being healthy means and what your body can do for you -- such as taking in the nutrients you need or gaining strength. If we could all accept that our bodies get us from this position to the next position, and that it's not about the way our bodies look, but what's inside -- it's amazing how much our bodies can give us back. It's important to accept who we are and our uniqueness. We have to accept our genetics. The more we can accept our bodies, the healthier we are likely to be. Believe that our bodies know best. ",

Instead, Biden and many vulnerable Democrats are gingerly trying to maneuver around inflation that is at a , the threat that new Covid-19 variants could derail the recovery -- amid fresh  -- and the ripple effects of a war in Ukraine that some western officials now believe may stretch until the .Comparing the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to an \"earthquake,\" the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday scaled back its , predicting the world economy would expand by 3.6% in both 2022 and 2023, a sharp slowdown from growth of 6.1% in 2021. The IMF warned in its report that the war would \"severely set back the global recovery, slowing growth and increasing inflation even further\" at a time when the effects of the pandemic are still being felt.The US labor market is strong, with the unemployment rate reaching  last month, but it's not clear voters will reward Biden for that. CNN's Matt Egan reported Tuesday that , with some forecasters saying Americans should brace for increases heading into the heavy summer driving season. That could serve as another blow to Biden just a few weeks after he announced with great fanfare that he was trying to  by releasing 1 million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next six months.There are also rising concerns about how the war is leading to greater global food insecurity with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stating in remarks Tuesday that \"the war has made an already  worse.\" In the midst of the conflict, prices have been rising at  on essential goods that include wheat, corn, soybeans, vegetable oils and fertilizer.\"Price and supply shocks are already materializing,\" Yellen said, \"adding to global inflationary pressures, creating risks to external balances, and undermining the recovery from the pandemic. I want to be clear: Russia's actions are responsible for this. But the United States is urgently working with our partners and allies to help mitigate the effects of Russia's reckless war on the world's most vulnerable.\"As the administration looks for ways to demonstrate to voters that they are focused on lowering their costs, officials announced additional changes to the federal student loan system Tuesday aimed at  in discharging their debt sooner. Biden's previous moves canceled student loan debt for some 700,000 borrowers by the end of March, totaling more than $17 billion in relief. But there is  so far that voters are giving him political credit for that as many of his Democratic colleagues urge him to do more ahead of what looks to be a challenging midterm environment.The White House framed Biden's trip to Portsmouth as a chance to show how he is using all the tools at his disposal to bring down prices for Americans while making investments in the nation's infrastructure to move goods more quickly and efficiently.But it was yet another foray out into the country that only underscored the  quickly to improve the bottom line for families right now.While Tuesday's focus was on the bipartisan infrastructure law he signed last year, the most memorable part of Biden's speech was his solemn attempt to prepare Americans for continuing economic turbulence ahead, as he argued that he was doing his best to deliver on his campaign promise to \"build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.\"\"The fact is that we are in a situation where the war in Ukraine is going to continue to take its toll on the world economy. It's going to take its toll on energy. It's going to take its toll relative to food,\" Biden said.He noted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has \"driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world.\" Calling Russian President Vladimir Putin \"a big reason for inflation,\" Biden worked in the administration's gimmicky phrase explaining the surge in gas and energy prices as \"Putin's price hike\" -- an attempt to blunt GOP messaging about high prices being his own fault. Alluding to the food insecurity issues that Yellen highlighted, Biden also pointed out that Ukraine and Russia are \"the two major  in the world.\"\"An awful lot of people are hurting. It makes a big difference, it makes a big difference -- the cost of a dozen eggs, the cost of a gallon of gasoline, it matters,\" the President said, alluding to his own financial struggles earlier in his life to underscore his empathy for what Americans are going through.While it is proving difficult for many Americans to connect their pressing pocketbook concerns to infrastructure improvements that will unfold over several years, at the Port Authority in Portsmouth Biden tried to emphasize how billions of dollars of improvements at America's ports -- through the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law -- could alleviate supply chain problems that have hampered the nation's economic recovery.He noted that the port in Portsmouth supports more than 2,300 jobs, emphasizing how a recently completed $18.2 million Army Corps of Engineers project to widen the turning basin in Portsmouth Harbor had made it \"easier, faster, and cheaper and safer for ships to get in and out.\" Without a planned $1.7 million dredging project that was included in the new infrastructure law, the port might have had to turn business away, he said.\"We're sending a message. This port is open for business and will be for a long time,\" the President said.\"There's so much more in this law,\" Biden said after detailing repairs to roads and bridges, the efforts to ensure clean drinking water by upgrading aging pipes, and the expansion of access to high-speed internet. \"I'm not going to bore you with the rest of it -- it's significant. Look, we've made a lot of progress and we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us. But we know that families are still struggling with higher prices.\"Biden lavished praise on New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, one of the , and Rep. Chris Pappas, who is trying to  in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, for helping to make the port upgrades happen.In a nod to independent voters in the region, Hassan emphasized her work with Republicans in Congress to get the infrastructure measure passed, citing the investments as \"the foundation for making sure that New Hampshire's families, small businesses and our entire economy can thrive.\"",

Other traditional automakers, such as  ,  ,   and  , are all expected to report a drop in earnings — ranging from a 14% decline at VW to a 58% plunge at Ford — due to  and production problems.But how the company does in the first quarter isn't the biggest concern for Tesla shareholders. It's what lies ahead for the company. Here's a rundown of what to look for in its earnings report and call with investors.Nine months ago, Musk announced he would generally stop participating in the quarterly call, saying it took too much of his time. That lasted exactly one quarter. By the time Tesla reported  in January, he was back on the call, though his comments appeared to do . Now with concerns among some investors that Musk's attention is being diverted by his bid for  , will he be on the call once again? There are risks for the company either way.\"From a perception standpoint, if he's not on the call, it feeds into the thesis that he's too busy with Twitter,\" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. At the same time, Musk can be a  on these calls. During the early days of the pandemic in April 2020 he lashed out at stay-at-home orders in California that temporarily shut his main factory, calling them \".\" If he makes similar comments about far more  now in place in much of China, he could anger Chinese authorities, who could make life very difficult for Tesla in the world's largest market for electric vehicles. Speaking of which, investors will want to know what's the outlook for . Tesla is reported to have  this week, though the company has yet to confirm that. Investors will want to know if it can stay open, and what is going on with the factories of suppliers of critical parts, such as batteries.\"The main focus of the earnings call must be around supply coming out of China,\" said Ives. \"That's the biggest overhang for the stock right now. They've already lost about 50,000 cars of production so far in the second quarter. The question is are they going to give any guidance?\"Once upon a time, automakers lived and died by their internal combustion engines. Features such as fuel injection and measures such as horsepower were the keys to attracting buyers and getting top dollars. Now in the age of EVs, it's batteries and a new set of performance measures: How far can a car go on a single charge? How fast can it charge? And how much will it cost to build?Tesla's next generation battery is the , which is expected to provide a breakthrough in both costs and the distance a vehicle can travel on a single charge. Tesla has only recently started using the battery in vehicles, and it is still only available in limited volumes. The outlook for production of that battery, and the supply of chips and raw materials it needs to build them, is crucial for Tesla's plans to increase vehicle production.Within the last five weeks, Teslahas started shipping cars from two new factories: one outside of  and one outside of , where its headquarters is now based.How fast it can ramp up production, particularly with the supply chain problems caused by China's Covid lockdowns, and to a lesser extent the war in Ukraine, is crucially important if the company is to hit its growth targets for the year.Beyond that, investors will probably be looking for more on the new products set to be built in Austin, namely the  and Tesla's Semi truck. No significant production of either is expected before 2023 at the earliest, but it will be a bad sign if they are pushed back even further, especially with  and  set to roll out their own electric trucks soon.The Ford 150 Lightning is due in showrooms this spring. The Silverado EV is due out next spring.Tesla's market cap is more than the combined value of the 12 largest automakers on the planet not because it is so much more profitable, but because of its growth projections. If it can't stick to its better than 50% annual growth path, the company's stock could take a tumble.Finally, if Musk is on the call it will be particularly interesting to see if he makes any comments about his efforts to buy Twitter. So far his comments have been in broad strokes, not details.And he hasn't said anything about whether he plans to be involved in the day-to-day management of Twitter.\"There are , at a time he should be so focused on Tesla, how can he juggle so many balls?\" said Ives.Musk also hasn't disclosed how he will finance his bid to buy the additional shares, which could cost in the neighborhood of $40 billion. Will he have to sell some of his Tesla stake to come up with the cash? If so, that would likely put downward pressure on Tesla's share price.",

No matter the form of public transportation -- planes, trains, trams, subways, buses or even rideshares -- the spread of Covid-19, but masks work best.\"You can't engineer your way out of a problem like this,\" said , an assistant professor of epidemiology and assistant professor in chemical and environmental engineering at the Yale Institute for Global Health. Someone infected with Covid-19 releases aerosols that contain the coronavirus when they talk, laugh or simply exhale. If the person isn't wearing a mask to block those aerosols, they can hang in the air and be inhaled by other people nearby. Outdoors, viral particles may disperse with even a light wind. But indoors, where there is no wind, particles tend to concentrate and hang around. Good ventilation can help break up the concentration of viral particles, but it can't do everything. \"Ventilation is great, but we know if we are outside, the risks are lower. Being able to re-create the same amount of airflow that you would have with just your natural wind patterns in a confined indoor space that's heavily occupied is incredibly hard to do,\" Pollitt said. \"Outside of putting yourself into, say, a wind tunnel, which obviously wouldn't be comfortable for many reasons or energy-wise, we have to think about what's realistic.\" On public transportation of any kind, a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system sucks in air from outside, treats it and pushes it into the cabin or car. It's a closed-loop system that can pull a little bit of fresh air. A bus or subway car can have 10 to 18 air exchanges per hour on the low side, according to Jim Alosi, a former Massachusetts secretary of transportation who is now a lecturer on transportation policy planning at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning; on the high side, it might have 40 to 50. \"Everything depends on the age of the equipment,\" Alosi said. Older systems are not as efficient as newer ones. Ventilated air that iswell-mixedhas good circulation and is relatively safe, said , an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who has done studies on how the coronavirus spreads in an environment.But when ventilation is not as good, the air is not so well-mixed, and there can be zones inside a room with a higher concentration of particles.\"One can't really predict where these zones are not well-mixed in a room. Really, it's a multidimensional problem, and it's not easy to predict in a not-so-well-mixed room how safe it is to stay for an extended duration of time,\" Mathai said.And if the transportation system wants maximum efficiency to cool or heat the air in a cabin, it can shut off the air intake and use what's already inside,, director of the Fresno State Transportation Institute and an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Geomatics Engineering at California State University, Fresno.\"Buses have filters, just like the ones inside our vehicles,\" Tawfik said. \"But they are not designed for viruses like the coronavirus or the flu virus.\"In May 2020, Tawfik and his team did  to see how a virus could spread through buses with a typical ventilation system. Using nontoxic colored candles and steam, they simulated how air flowed in a variety of buses. They found thatHVAC systems are extremely efficient and hold cool or the warm air inside a bus a lot longer than some may expect. When the team introduced smoke, they saw that it spread in seconds and filled the whole cabin. Even when they opened the doors and introduced fresh air into the HVAC systems, the smoke lingered for minutes. The researchers think the virus behaves like the smoke did and could linger even after an infected person has left a bus. \"These were unpleasant findings, because it means that opening the doors and windows doesn't help much,\" Tawfik said. \"The systems were designed to treat air fast and keep it inside the cabin for a long period of time.\"With another experiment, the team tried to see if they could treat the air to make it safer. They tested the buses with three viruses that were similar to the coronavirus. Cooling the air mitigated an average of about 80% of the viruses, and heating was at about 90%.\"That does not necessarily mean that it's safe, because this 10% is still millions of viruses,\" Tawfik said. For one thing, it's not clear how much of the virus virus it takes to infect someone. HEPA filters mitigated about 94% of the viruses. Ionizers were a little less efficient, but photocatalytic oxidation and UV lights were better. UV lights in the HVAC system removed about 99% of the viruses. Northern California's BART system and New York's Metro system are among those that have introduced some of these technologies during the pandemic.People can catch Covid-19 on planes, especially when an infected person isn't wearing a mask, but a plane's air system is much stronger than one on a bus or train.Airplanes use HEPA filters that can capture about 99% of particles in the air. They also have better air circulation when flying. Air is typically fed in through the top of the cabin, extracted by floor vents, fed through those filters and eventually sent back into the cabin.  bring in air in a top-to-bottom direction about 20 to 30 times per hour, creating a 50-50 mix of outside and recirculated air and reducing the potential spread of the virus. So the risk of getting sick is low, the experts say.However, people are usually on planes a lot longer than they may be on a subway or on a bus, and more time in a crowded plane can increase someone's exposure. When a plane is parked, it does not have that superior circulation.\"Airplane systems are a little similar to bus systems when they are on the ground,\" Tawfik said. That's why  you'll notice the temperature isn't as well-regulated then, and it's also when there isn't the same amount of fresh air circulating. It's then dealing with the same challenges.\"Uber and Lyft have dropped their mask mandates, and many taxi companies have stopped requiring masks.Infection in a car is certainly possible, You can always wear a mask, and some experts suggest opening car windows and keeping talk to a minimum. Keep in mind that shorter rides are also better than longer ones.Alosi said there are things that transportation systems could do to mitigate some of the risk. Trains and buses could run more often so there aren't as many people on board, for instance. He says it could help to require people to show proof of vaccination if they want to get on a train or plane. That probably wouldn't work with subways or buses, though, nor would it fly politically. Alosi thinks public transportation has been unfairly stigmatized. \"If you're not up in arms about people being unmasked in the grocery store, you should chill out about public transit,\" he said. Even before masks were mandatory on public transportation, , mass transit systems don't seem to be major drivers of viral spread.  And although it's not mandatory, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. \"When you spend significant duration indoors, you obviously inhale, and if you have co-occupants who are potentially infected, you can inhale these tiny droplets that can get you sick,\" Mathai said. Ventilation absolutely helps, he said, but protecting yourself can take multiple tools of mitigation.  \"Masks really reduce the momentum of these released aerosol droplets.\"A mask  when others aren't wearing them. \"Just wearing a mask is a such a simple solution to increasing the level of safety,\" Pollitt said. \"Putting one on, it's an easy thing to do.\" ",

Officials this week temporarily  flights again from India, Pakistan and the Philippines.As of Wednesday, 11 flight routes from 10 airlines had been temporarily cut off, including those from London and Amsterdam, the government said in a statement.The latest disruption is linked to a controversial regulation that requires routes to be suspended for seven days if three or more passengers on an incoming flight test positive for Covid-19 or have insufficient health documentation.The carriers affected are Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air India, Turkish Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, All Nippon Airways and regional budget airline Scoot, according to Hong Kong authorities.In recent months, the rise of the  has meant this rule has been repeatedly activated, causing many flights into the city to be canceled and chaos for travelers around the world. So far this month, 21 routes have already been suspended over the rule, according to a CNN tally.Joanne Townson, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 25 years, said she'd had at least six flights to the city canceled over the last 16 months for various reasons, including the regulation. She said Hong Kong's flight bans and quarantine restrictions recently prompted her to resign \"from a job I loved\" and fly to Europe, because she had been unable to see her daughters for 18 months.

Walsh added that Hong Kong's status as an international hub had \"slipped,\" leaving it \"effectively off the map now.\"\"I think it's going to be difficult for Hong Kong to recover,\" he said.Frederik Gollob, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told CNN Business that the airport used to be one of the city's biggest advantages.Besides the city's quarantine rules, flight suspensions are one of \"the biggest\" concerns of the international business community, he added.

But the economy isn't helping, either.Inflation is forcing households to reevaluate their budgets. People in Great Britain canceled about 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of 2022. More than a third did so to save money, according to a new report by media consultancy Kantar.\"Food and energy are people's priorities right now, not watching 'Stranger Things,'\" CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson told me.Netflix signaled it could make big changes to its business as it tries to stem the bleeding. It's taking another look at how to address password sharing. CEO Reed Hastings also told analysts that the company will consider a lower-price subscription option with advertising.\"I've been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\" Hastings said Tuesday. \"But as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice.\"Big picture: Hewson said the stock plunge shows that Netflix was extremely overvalued, as investors — flush with cash during the pandemic recovery — fed a huge rally. Shares of Netflix rose 86% from the end of 2019 through 2021, while the S&P 500 climbed 48%.\"They were assuming people were going to be locked down forever,\" Hewson said, adding that unlike Apple and Amazon, Netflix doesn't have many alternative sources of revenue.Clearly, the market mood has changed. The strong reaction could set the stage for another turbulent earnings season, with investors already on edge after disappointing results from the big banks.When companies reported fourth quarter results earlier this year, Netflix and Facebook experienced huge stock losses as investors signaled growing sensitivity to downbeat predictions for the future. That was because the Federal Reserve was set to start raising interest rates, a move that would weigh on high-growth companies. Facebook's disastrous results triggered the biggest loss in market value for an S&P 500 company on record.Now, rates are officially on the rise, and there's daily debate about whether the Fed could be even more aggressive than expected. The war in Ukraine is also dragging down sentiment. That could tee up big swings for top stocks as they disclose results.Investors have been spending a lot of time following CEO Elon Musk's ploy to buy Twitter. But come Wednesday evening,  to a company he already controls.  reports first quarter results after markets close. Analysts have strong expectations, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports.The electric carmaker's earnings are forecast to jump 142% from a year ago. Other traditional automakers, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen are all expected to report a drop in earnings due to supply chain problems and production issues.Watch this space: Musk joined the call with analysts last quarter. Will he be on this time around?If he isn't, that could feed Wall Street's worries that he's too busy trying to take Twitter private to deal with his management responsibilities. If Musk does dial in, there could still be risks, given his tendency to speak off the cuff.Another point of focus will be lockdowns in China, which have affected Tesla's production in Shanghai. Credit Suisse analysts estimate that the recent shutdown there prevented the manufacture of 90,000 vehicles.Shareholders will want to know if the plant can stay open given restrictions, and how suppliers of critical parts such as batteries are faring.Investor insight: A lot is riding on Tesla's performance. Disappointing results could further disrupt a stock market that's already unsteady.Prices at the pump have stopped falling from their recent highs — and some forecasters are warning of another uptick as the summer driving season looms and the war in Ukraine drags on, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports.After a slow-but-steady decline, the national average price for regular gasoline bottomed out at $4.07 a gallon last week, according to AAA.

But Johnson has thus far declined to resign from his post and, with no general election scheduled until 2024, his fate will ultimately be determined by his own Conservative members of parliament, the only people who can remove him from office prematurely. For now, they seem content with him remaining in Downing Street despite poll after poll showing the public thinks he should resign. Johnson is embroiled in the worst crisis of his premiership after the  for  by attending a 2020 birthday gathering thrown in his honor, in his office, at the height of lockdown. The Conservative party's polling doesn't look too good either, though party sources think on balance Johnson is still more of an electoral asset than a problem. They are aware that this could change if Johnson is issued with another fine by police or more details emerge from the so-called \"Partygate\" scandal. What this means in the medium-term is that Johnson simply has to plough on and avoid the various pitfalls directly in front of him -- which his allies note he has managed to do so far and can continue to do so. The first such pitfall arrives on Thursday, when members of parliament will be able to vote on a motion tabled by the opposition parties that would refer the Prime Minister to a parliamentary committee that would investigate his conduct. Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour party, said: \"We are urging Conservative MPs to do the right thing. To respect the sacrifices that their constituents made during the pandemic.\"Johnson, who has a sizeable parliamentary majority, is expected to survive the vote, but Labour sources are quietly briefing that the motion will be politically toxic for Johnson either way. If Conservative MPs vote against holding the inquiry, Labour will be able to go to their seats at the next election and point out that they voted to protect the Prime Minister from scrutiny.  And there will be another test just weeks down the road: Local elections take place across the country on May 5. While they won't remove Johnson from office, the elections will be an opportunity for voters to send a message of fury straight to Downing Street. While the Conservatives have suffered huge dips in multiple polls ahead of the elections, observers believe it would take a spectacular defeat for Johnson's lawmakers to commit political regicide against Johnson. But it's not out of the question -- and those who have seriously considered removing the Prime Minister from office see the summer as the best time to get rid of him, as it would give a new leader enough time to settle into the job before the next general election. After these elections, the pitfalls are slightly more difficult to predict. At any time, Johnson could be fined again for other gatherings held in Downing Street that broke his own government's laws. And the final report by a senior civil service officer into the Partygate scandal could be so damning that Conservative poll numbers slump even further. However, for the time being, Johnson remains in his job, unwilling to resign and no one is strong enough to force him out. It's frustrating for those who want him gone, but the politics simply make it practically impossible to get rid of Johnson in the immediate future. Whether that is a good thing for Johnson and his party is a different question altogether -- and there are Labour figures who think Johnson fighting the next general election would be preferable to a new, more credible alternative.

        "content": "The Ohio doctor accused of overprescribing fentanyl to his critically ill patients and hastening their deaths was found not guilty of 14 counts of murder on Wednesday.William Husel and his attorney embraced at the defense table after the 14th and final not guilty verdict was read in court. He was subsequently discharged from the courtroom.The decision comes just over a week after jurors began deliberating and days after they said , leading Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook to instruct them to continue their deliberations.After the verdict, Franklin County Ohio prosecutor Gary Tyack praised both sides of the case.\"The State of Ohio v. William Husel was carefully tried and prepared by both the Prosecution and the Defense,\" he said. \"The Jury after review of all the evidence was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that William Husel was guilty of any charges submitted to them. We accept the jury verdict.\"Defense attorney Jose Baez celebrated the acquittal and criticized the investigation that led to charges. In a Zoom call with reporters, he said Husel hopes to eventually practice medicine again.\"I can tell you he's incredibly happy and grateful. He wants this time right now to spend with his family,\" Baez said. \"They're incredibly relieved that this nightmare is finally over.\"as prosecutors said he purposely administered excessive doses of fentanyl that caused or sped up the deaths of patients in the intensive care unit from 2015 to 2018. All of the counts also included the lesser charge of attempted murder.\"If you hasten a person's death, even if their death is as sure as the sun is going to rise in the morning, if you hasten that along, you have caused their death under the eyes of the law,\" Franklin County prosecutor David Zeyen said in closing arguments.Baez argued prosecutors had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the doses actually hastened the patients' deaths or that Husel purposely intended to kill the patients.The trial began in February, with over 50 witnesses testifying for the prosecution, including doctors, nurses and administrative employees of Mount Carmel Hospital West, where Husel worked as the night ICU physician.Family members detailed the stories of their loved ones declining quickly once at the hospital, as well as their experiences with Husel and the ICU. Experts also told the court the large fentanyl doses Husel gave to patients caused their deaths and were intended to accelerate the dying process.Despite the accusations, Husel's former colleagues testified that he was a wonderful doctor who was hardworking, fought to save people's lives, was helpful to everyone in the ICU unit and was always there to teach and explain.Husel's defense called just one witness, Dr. Joel Zivot, who studied the medical records of the 14 patients and determined they had severe and unrecoverable illnesses. Zivot also testified that recovery to a normal state of health was not possible for the patients, and he determined underlying medical issues caused their deaths.Husel did not take the stand. His medical license is currently suspended, defense counsel confirmed to CNN.The trial comes almost three years after Husel, 46, was , though 11 of those counts were dismissed pretrial.The Mount Carmel Health System initially said the hospital received a report related to Husel's care on October 25, 2018. The hospital system . In that period, three people died \"after receiving excessive and potentially fatal doses of medication\" ordered by the doctor, the hospital said in a statement.Husel was fired December 5, 2018. That same month, an attorney representing Mount Carmel reached out to the Franklin County prosecutor's office, launching an investigation into Husel.During their initial conversations, the attorney said a doctor -- later identified as Husel -- was \"administering doses of fentanyl at a level that they internally believed were inappropriate and not for a legitimate medical purpose,\" said Ron O'Brien, the Franklin County prosecutor at the time.The investigation found the doses, which ranged from 500 to 2,000 micrograms, \"were designed to hasten the death of the patients that were being treated,\" O'Brien said.Fentanyl is an opioid used to treat patients with chronic severe pain or severe pain after surgery, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

        "content": ". on airplanes and other modes of public transportation in the United States following a court ruling that marks a pivotal moment in America's battle against the coronavirus.  A federal judge in Florida struck down the Biden administration's mask mandate on Monday after it was extended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through May 3. The US Surgeon General said last week that part of the reason for the extension was rising Covid-19 cases and the closed settings created by travel. The Justice Department said Tuesday it will appeal the ruling -- but  that the mandate is still necessary to protect public health. Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN that \"mask-wearing on interstate transportation is still an important intervention that's worth continuing.\" \"The biggest concern is, we want people to be safe and we're concerned that we're not through the pandemic yet as much as people want to be, and (Covid-19) rates are starting to tick back up.\" Although the White House confirmed the  while the ruling is being reviewed, it said it still recommends people cover their mouths and noses when traveling.  But if experience from other countries is anything to go by, shifting from \"compulsory\" to \"recommended\" will likely mean most people won't bother. Videos showing air passengers joyfully removing their masks mid-flight when the decision was announced suggest the same. England lifted mask requirements in January, part of its new  strategy. While face coverings remain strongly recommended in many places, including the London Underground system, anecdotal evidence shows the majority of people no longer wear them.  In France, masks are no longer required indoors except on public transport. Judging by the situation in Paris, the divide is clear: Most people still wear masks where they are mandatory but take them off in places that only recommend them. Still, some countries continue to impose strict mask rules.  In , high grade FFP2 masks must still be worn indoors, and anyone not wearing one can be fined up to $450. Individual cities and regions can also bring in outdoor mask mandates in crowded places. In Hong Kong, masks remain mandatory in all public places, including when exercising outside.Face masks offer the most protection against the spread of virus-carrying particles in the air when everyone wears them. But research also suggests that masks can protect the wearer alone, by acting as a barrier between particles and their nose and mouth. Even if everyone around you is maskless, wearing a well-fitted  of infectious particles you could breathe in, according to Chris Cappa, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis who studies aerosol particles and masks.  \"If there were theoretically 100 infectious particles that you were about to breathe in with no mask you would only breathe in five or fewer with the well-fitting N95,\" he said.When the father of CNN's Beijing Bureau chief Steven Jiang raised concerns about his shrinking food supply late last week, the catastrophe brought by  suddenly hit home. \"Will be running out in a few days if no government handout soon,\" he messaged Jiang Thursday. Then, as if anticipating his son's inevitable worry, he added: \"Still have some rice and crackers -- and plenty of coffee.\" It was a startling revelation of the grim reality in China's biggest city and financial hub -- from a member of the generation that lived through the Great Famine and the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that killed millions during the first few decades of the People's Republic, founded in 1949 by Communist revolutionary Mao Zedong. With lockdown measures turning increasingly draconian, a once almost-unthinkable topic has struck a chord with residents in the city and beyond, more so than anything else: People going hungry in Shanghai in 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration last week granted emergency use authorization to the first Covid-19 test that spots . The FDA said the InspectIR Covid-19 Breathalyzer, which is about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, can be used in medical offices and mobile testing sites. It can give results in less than three minutes. The system separates and identifies chemical mixtures to detect five compounds associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  A study of the InspectIR Breathalyzer found that it accurately identified more than 91% of positive samples and nearly 100% of negative samples. Similar sensitivity was found in another study that focused on the Omicron coronavirus variant. However, a positive result should be confirmed with a PCR test, the FDA said. , which involves the virus spreading at a single event on a larger scale than what is typically expected, is still possible and poses a risk.  But at this stage of the pandemic, a large event may not necessarily be an invitation to widespread, unchecked illness -- if people use tools now available to limit risk, according to public health experts. We now have authorized vaccinations that limit illnesses and infections, robust supplies of at-home tests that can indicate whether someone needs to isolate, face masks to wear in high-risk situations and therapeutics that can reduce severe disease, . Taking a home coronavirus test is much more convenient than going to a clinic, but experts say there is one key downside. Positive results from Covid-19 tests administered by medical professionals are ultimately reported and included in official numbers. But there isn't any requirement for people to report their self-test results to health care providers or local public health departments. That means that infection rates are likely much higher than they appear from the official data.  In the US, only 7% of positive cases are detected, which means that case rates are 14.5% higher than reported, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  to your local public health department helps experts understand the prevalence of a new disease in different communities.

His extradition has been the subject of numerous court dates since his arrest, which took place after Assange sought diplomatic refuge in the embassy for seven years.

        "content": "Actor Johnny Depp resumed his testimony in a Fairfax, Virginia court in his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard on Wednesday. Depp discussed the changing nature of his relationship with Heard. He accused Heard of name calling and making demeaning comments about him at times in their relationship that would escalate to arguments. \"I was not allowed to be right, not allowed to have a voice,\" Depp said.An argument between the former couple in 2015 ended with Depp seeking medical care for a severed finger after, he claims, Heard threw a bottle of vodka at him.\"She threw the large bottle and it made contact [with his hand] and shattered everywhere,\" Depp testifed. \"Then I looked down and realized that my tip of my finger had been severed.\"\"I don't know what I nervous breakdown feels like,\" Depp added. \"But that's probably the closest I had ever been.\"Heard has denied the claim.In his roughly three-hour testimony on Tuesday, the Oscar-nominated star spoke in detail about Heard's allegations of domestic abuse, his history with substance abuse and his experiences growing up with an abusive mother. \"You slowly realize you're in a relationship with your mother, in a sense,\" Depp testified Wednesday about his dynamic with Heard, comparing the abuse he says he experienced by his mother to Heard's alleged abuse.Depp's attorney asked him why he stayed with Heard as their relationship deteriorated. \"I wanted to try to make it work,\" he said. \"Ms. Heard had spoken of suicide on a couple of occasions, so that also becomes a factor, that's something that lives in the back of your brain,\" Depp said.The actor, known for his work in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, is suing Heard for $50 million over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she wrote about her experience with domestic abuse. She did not name Depp in the piece, but he claims it cost him lucrative film work. Depp has maintained his innocence and testified that while he and Heard had arguments during their relationship, he has never \"struck a woman.\" In his lengthy second day of testimony, Depp discussed his tattoos, telling the court Heard would make fun of some of them, which he equated to keeping a journal of his life. He referenced a \"Winona forever\" tattoo, which Depp said he got for his former-girlfriend, actress Winona Ryder, but changed it to \"Wino forever\" after they broke up. He said Heard didn't like it.\"I took off the last two letters and had it say 'Wino forever,'\" Depp said, adding, \"I thought through pain comes humor. Humor has to come in there into the pain and that's how you play it out in the mind... so I changed it to 'Wino forever.'\"He said that Heard wanted him to get a tattoo of her own name, which he eventually did.\"And ironically it wasn't long after that that everything started going sideways,\" Depp said. \"I was doing everything I could to bring a smile to her face as opposed to a frown and then the onslaught of whatever problems she was experiencing,\" he said. \"I would try to wake her up with laughter, singing stupid songs in her ear. I generally just tried to keep bringing her mood up. Sometimes it worked, many times it didn't. But I tried.\" Depp gave further about his use of oxycodone during the time he was with Heard and symptoms of withdrawal he would experience when he went through detox.Depp and Amber met on the set of \"The Rum Diary\" in 2009, married in 2015 and went to a contentious split, with charges of bad behavior levied by both sides.The couple settled their divorce in August 2016, releasing a joint statement which read in part, \"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love.\"Heard had been unsuccessful in her attempts to get the suit dismissed. She filed a $100 million defamation countersuit against Depp in 2020, which is ongoing.In 2020, Depp lost a libel case in the UK against News Group Newspapers and Dan Wootton, executive editor of The Sun, over an article that claimed Depp was violent toward Heard during their relationship. The court ruled in the publisher's favor, determining the tabloid's claims were shown to be \"substantially true.\"Chloe Melas, Lisa France and Sandra Gonzalez contributed to this story.",

        "content": "Joe Biden would probably like to forget the last few days.  They've been filled with confusing messages on critical topics, projecting an image of a directionless White House led by a President whose tendency to veer off message is only adding to his problems.Consider:* Astruck down the administration's  on Monday. In response to that ruling, the Biden administration first didn't make clear what its next steps would be. Then late in the day on Tuesday, the administration said it would  -- if the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines the mandate is still needed. In the midst of all of that, Biden added to the confusion, telling reporters during a trip to New Hampshire Tuesday that it was \"\" when it came to people wearing masks on public transportation.* The administration has a revolt on its hands over its previously announced decision to rescind Title 42, a public health measure put in place in March 2020 -- in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic -- that allowed border patrol officials to turn away migrants seeking asylum. Earlier this week, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who runs the Democrats' Senate campaign committee, said of Title 42 that \"unless we have a well thought out plan, I think it is something that should be revisited and perhaps delayed.\" That follows questions raised by a number of Democrats on the ballot this year, concerned that rescinding Title 42 will lead to a flood of undocumented immigrants at the border. In the face of all of that,  Tuesday that the administration is considering \"delaying the repeal of Title 42 border restrictions.\"* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading liberal voices in the country,  suggesting that Biden and the Democrats need to start playing offense, legislatively speaking. \"Despite pandemic relief, infrastructure investments and the historic Supreme Court confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, we promised more — and voters remember those promises,\" wrote Warren. And this bit of frank talk: \"To put it bluntly: if we fail to use the months remaining before the elections to deliver on more of our agenda, Democrats are headed toward big losses in the midterms.\"All of this comes as Biden is at or near his low ebb in terms of job approval during his term. In  -- an average of the last four national polls -- Biden's approval rating is at just 39% among Americans, with his disapproval at 55%.In short: Biden didn't have a lot of goodwill left with the public before this week. But the conflicting messages coming out of the White House -- and the broader Democratic Party -- make it look like there is no plan to turn things around in advance of the midterm elections, which are now just over 200 days off.Perhaps in an attempt to address this sense of a lack of direction, Biden put out a series of tweets Wednesday morning blaming inflation on Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine and urging Congress to take action. \"I've called on Congress to move immediately to lower the cost of families' utility bills, prescription drugs, and more — while lowering the deficit to reduce inflationary pressure,\" It's not clear that there is much desire among Democrats -- many of whom are eager to get home and campaign before the midterm elections -- to follow through on Biden's push.It's all a mess for Democrats. And a mess without any clear -- or easy -- solutions.",

        "content": "The 10-month-old Israeli coalition government is facing its deepest political crisis to date, after weeks of high-profile attacks across Israel, military action in the West Bank, and after Israeli police entered and arrested hundreds at one of  holiest sites.    From its inception, the coalition government had a razor thin margin, made up of a lineup of political parties from the far left to the right wing, including the first Arab party to be an active member of a government coalition.  Because of that diverse makeup, the government said early on that it had no intention of tackling the most contentious issues in Israeli politics. But escalations in recent weeks have placed those issues front and center.  Its one-seat majority in parliament was lost  when Idit Silman, a member of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's own party, defected. The move sent political shockwaves throughout Israel but did not necessarily mean the current government would collapse, especially since the opposition, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, doesn't have the numbers for a majority itself.     But that could be changing. In recent days, during commemorations of both Passover and Ramadan, Israeli police say they arrested more than 300 people at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where police say people throwing rocks and launching fireworks were jeopardizing safe worship. The Palestinian Red Crescent said scores of people were injured by rubber bullets, stun grenades, and police batons. The presence of Israeli police inside the mosque itself became a flashpoint, as it is regarded as offensive to Muslims and puts a strain on a decades-old \"status quo\" agreement about the site. In response, the United Arab List party, also known by its acronym Ra'am, suspended its membership in the coalition to protest what it said was Israeli police violence at the holy site that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims.    \"If the government continues its steps against Al-Quds and its people, Al-Aqsa, its worshipers and its sanctuaries in this holy month, we will submit a collective resignation, and we call on all parties to cooperate with and support this decision,\" party members said in a statement.   For the moment, the action has no immediate consequences -- Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is in recess for a few more weeks and by the time it returns, the party could decide to sit with the coalition once again.     But if even just one member of the UAL party defects from the coalition, Netanyahu could potentially have the numbers in hand to call for a vote to dissolve parliament and trigger new elections, giving him a pathway back to power.     Never before in Israeli history has the fate of a government been in the hands of an Arab, non-Jewish party. Without UAL's support,  would never have taken power. And even before joining the government, party leader Mansour Abbas had said that while he's a proud member of the government with the aim of improving the lives of the approximately 20% of Israel's population that identifies as Arab, he has his own \"red lines\" -- though it remains unclear exactly where those lines are.    \"I said and I continue to say that the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque is a red line in which there is no compromise,\" Abbas wrote in a Facebook post last week. \"This is what I conveyed today in my conversation with the officials with whom I communicated, and I explained to them my position.\"   Apart from Abbas' vaunted leverage in the governing coalition, there are other officials whose influence may be moderating the response of Israeli police. as well. Israeli Minister of Public Security Omer Bar Lev is a member of the left-leaning Labor Party. And Defense Minister Benny Gantz has pushed forward increasing the number of work permits, believing that giving Palestinians more economic opportunity will bring more calm.     In Jerusalem, Israeli officials believe they have shown restraint in policing tactics on Palestinians around the mosque and Old City. Israeli media report police have been more reserved in their responses during clashes than in previous incidents and haven't employed the kind of tactics that inflamed tensions during Ramadan last year, like barring people from gathering at the Damascus Gate plaza.   Israeli officials emphasized that even after the worst of the clashes on Friday, more than 50,000 Muslim worshippers attended prayers at the compound peacefully, although at various points since then Muslim worshippers were blocked from Al Aqsa as police accompanied Jewish groups and foreign tourists on scheduled visits.    The compound is often a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It lies in East Jerusalem, which most of the international community regards as having been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Israel disputes that and claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state.     This Ramadan, Israeli restrictions on movement of Palestinians between the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have not been as tight as before for those with Israeli-issued permits.     At the same time though, Israel has launched raids across the West Bank in response to Palestinian attacks, and 14 Palestinians have died since late March in clashes with Israeli security forces or been shot dead by Israeli soldiers for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails or soldiers at a checkpoint.      The real test for the Israeli government will come in early May, when parliament comes back into session. That is when the true fragility of their position will be made clear.    Digital rights watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday it had warned British officials that electronic devices connected to government networks, including some inside the prime minister's office and foreign ministry, appeared to be infected with Israeli-made spy software. It said the government was targeted by the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus, Jordan and India. The UAE foreign ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador to protest the treatment of Palestinians in Jerusalem by Israeli forces, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Turkish authorities jailed a journalist on Tuesday pending trial after he announced hackers had stolen personal information from government websites and shared some of it with him, including President Tayyip Erdogan's ID card, as proof, his lawyer said. This Ramadan, drama went beyond the screen with the premiere of television series \"From the pyramid road to...\" about a love triangle that involves a sultry Egyptian woman and a Kuwaiti couple.  The Saudi state-owned channel MBC's broadcast of  the Kuwaiti family drama is raising eyebrows in the Kuwaiti government and as far away as Egypt.  Written by Kuwaiti writer Hiba Hamada, the show follows the struggle between Abla, a doctor and wife of a wealthy Kuwaiti, and an Egyptian belly dancer trying to drive a wedge between them for self-interest. Kareema, the dancer, is hired to perform at the wedding of Abla's son. After the celebrations, she is unable to return home and stays at Abla's family home, where she tries to seduce her husband.  The show touches on topics deemed controversial in Kuwait such as gender roles and relations and has prompted accusations of stereotyping on social media. In one scene, Abla is shown lecturing her son about men's perceptions of women's clothing, saying women will be harassed in Kuwait no matter what they wear. Egyptians took issue with the portrayal of Egyptian women as dancers chasing after wealthy men from the Gulf.  The controversy led the Kuwaiti ministry of information to distance itself from the show, saying on Twitter that it \"is not produced by a Kuwaiti company, has been filmed outside Kuwait, and is broadcast on platforms outside of Kuwait.\" While the show was filmed in the UAE, the ministry said it will launch an investigation into any scenes that may have been filmed within Kuwait without a permit.
