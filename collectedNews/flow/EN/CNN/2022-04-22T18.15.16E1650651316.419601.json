        "content": "When Shirley Raines was  in New York City last December, she wasted no time bringing the honor back to her Skid Row community in Los Angeles.\"It's just a really amazing opportunity for the homeless to be seen, helped ... for people to understand what they're going through,\" she said. The founder of the non-profit , Raines provides hair and makeup services, food, clothing, hygiene and safety items to thousands of homeless people every week. She hopes the award will continue to garner attention for a community that is struggling and often overlooked.\"I think it's important to change the narrative of what people think Skid Row is about, to see the commonalities that we have,\" Raines said.Rain or shine, she sets up \"shop\" weekly at the corner of 5th and Towne to serve those she calls \"Kings\" and \"Queens.\" Her goal is to help them see themselves as worthy, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Raines says she knows how it feels to be labeled. For decades, she struggled with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her first son.\"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"After volunteering with a church group on Skid Row, Raines said it was the homeless community that helped her find purpose. \"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave.\"Early on, Raines began live-streaming her Beauty 2 the Streetz events on Instagram and Tik Tok and soon gathered a devoted social media following. She has more than 4 million followers on social media -- people who not only want to help but also follow her work and life. In times of need, Raines often appeals to them for donated tents and hygiene items.And in 2021, when Raines found out she was a Top 10 CNN Hero, she also encouraged her followers to vote for her for CNN Hero of the Year. \"As much as you want to say it doesn't really matter, let's be real. I wanted to bring that prize money, that win, that recognition to the community,\" she said. \"It felt really good to know that social media really rocked with us.\" Raines was presented with the award by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa and thanked the Skid Row community and her children, including her late son, who inspired her work.\"I wanted people to understand you are not looking at a woman who buried a child, who started a non-profit, got her life together, and now she's a CNN Hero winner,\" Raines said. \"You're looking at a woman who did all those things and remains very much broken, but yet is still a CNN Hero winner.\"Raines' organization received $100,000 to expand its work, and she says the money will be used for feeding programs. As homeless populations increase, she says they need support more than ever.  \"The work continues on,\" Raines said. \"But it's the hardest thing to get the support and help for. There's a massive need for tents (and) blankets down here.\"For those Raines serves, the honor and award have indeed been a win.\"It was like a team feeling,\" said Skid Row resident Michael Jackson who was featured in Raines' profile piece. \"Everyone was approaching me ... I was happy and proud just to know her. She's helped out more people than you can imagine.\"Despite the honor, Raines says she wants to stay grounded and doesn't think of herself as a hero.\"I don't do hero stuff, I do human stuff,\" she said. \"I work out here in the streets to gain the trust of my community. The world had that opportunity to vote for 10 amazing organizations. And they chose one that dealt with homelessness ... to them that might say, 'Oh my god. People really are paying attention. People really do care.'\"CNN's Dan Przygoda contributed to this story.",

        "content": "The glittering skylines of Hong Kong and Shanghai have long been associated with wealth and glamor. But in recent weeks, they have become synonymous with a much grimmer reality, as authorities in the two international finance hubs struggle to contain raging Omicron outbreaks.Extreme Covid measures have heavily restricted the lives of residents in both cities, with Shanghai now entering the third week of government-mandated home lockdown, and Hong Kong chafing under a third year of quarantine and travel curbs. Once China's gateways to the West, heavy-handed border closures and suspended air routes have closed the two cities off to much of the world, even as other hubs open up. On Tuesday,  arrived in Hong Kong from outside Asia Pacific --a stark contrast to the pre-pandemic era when the city's airport was one of the world's busiest, regularly hosting 1,100 passenger and cargo flights daily to and from 200 international destinations. Now most of the traffic is outbound, carrying residents fleeing Hong Kong for greener pastures with fewer restrictions. In February and March, more than 180,000 people left the city while only about 39,000 entered, according to immigration data.Shanghai, like Hong Kong, is home to large numbers of foreign residents -- but fears are growing that too could soon change.JÃ¶rg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, estimates China has lost about 50% of all European expatriates since the pandemic started -- and he warns there could be another exodus of families this summer when the school year ends. \"I wouldn't be surprised if another half of (those remaining) leave,\" he told CNNA recent report by the British Chamber of Commerce in China appeared to back up this assessment, noting that international schools in China could see at least 40% of teachers leave ahead of the upcoming school year -- which could prompt more families to relocate.Driving these departures is China's adherence to an uncompromising zero-Covid policy that relies on a combination of strict border quarantines, home lockdowns and mass testing in a bid to stamp out infections.But those measures no longer appear sufficient in the face of the latest Omicron wave. Hong Kong recorded the  in Asia and Oceania last month as cases spiked and the virus ripped through elderly care homes. Shanghai plunged into crisis soon after, with all 25 million residents placed under mandatory home lockdown in late March. Many in Shanghai have complained of being unable to access food, basic supplies and even medical care during emergencies. Reports of health workers forcing elderly residents into quarantine and of workers killing a pet corgi after its owner tested positive fueled  toward the government on Chinese social media.\"Shanghai is really pushing us to the corner. They don't treat us like humans at all,\" one user wrote on Weibo, China's highly censored Twitter-like platform.\"I really can't understand. How could it be this bad? What's happening to Shanghai?\" another popular Weibo comment read.Before this wave, Shanghai officials had prided themselves on their less disruptive approach to containing outbreaks, and had avoided the kind of citywide mass testing seen in other major Chinese cities. Hong Kong, too, had once been lauded as a zero-Covid success story. Though it had previously faced several outbreaks, its death rate remained low until a fifth wave arrived in February. The risk of infection seemed so low that many residents -- particularly the elderly -- didn't view vaccination as a priority, leaving much of the city vulnerable when Omicron struck.Now, as a growing number of residents look to leave, that sense of relative safety -- and both cities' standing as international capitals of travel and commerce -- seems further away than ever.\"We've gone over a month without making any money as a business,\" said Josh Vaughn, an American entrepreneur in Shanghai who owns an online sunglasses brand. \"It makes me stressed thinking about it because I don't know when this lockdown is going to end ... I'm so scared that this could be the end of my business.\"Vaughn said that after contracting Covid this month he faced hostility from his neighbors, who were reluctant to let him back into his apartment building after he was discharged from hospital -- echoing similar experiences from other expatriates who have felt ostracized.Wuttke, the European Union Chamber of Commerce president, warned that the economic impact of China's Covid restrictions could push some foreign companies to consider moving regional headquarters out of greater China -- throwing the future of major business hubs like Shanghai and Hong Kong into question as the rest of the world opens up. Singapore, which for years for the title of Asia's top international business hub, was the first Asian country to declare it was moving away from a zero-Covid policy to living with the virus last year. Some in Hong Kong's business sector are now eying the Southeast Asian city state, which lifted  for vaccinated travelers in April.Chinese authorities have acknowledged this precarious position, with Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam saying in late March, \"I have a very strong feeling that people's tolerance are fading ... that some of our financial institutions are losing patience about this sort of isolated status of Hong Kong, as Hong Kong is an international financial center.\"In an effort to boost Hong Kong's flagging economy, Lam lifted some flight bans and shortened quarantine requirements last month. But it may be too little, too late -- especially as Chinese officials and state media ramp up rhetoric praising China's zero-Covid policy, offering little hope that these international financial centers will open up anytime soon.Gabriele, an Italian resident in Shanghai who asked to be identified by his first name only, tested positive in early April and has since been confined to his apartment for more than three weeks, he said. Describing the situation as a \"nightmare,\" Gabriele said health workers said they would come to test him again but \"never showed up,\" and attempts to contact local authorities have gone nowhere. \"We feel helpless,\" he said.Now, he's thinking of moving home for good -- leaving behind a city he had once loved. \"The city completely lost its shine. I don't know if it will recover,\" he said. \"It's like a completely different city ... it really feels like we're going backwards in time instead of looking forward to the future.\"Additional reporting by CNN's Akanksha Sharma and Michelle Toh",

        "content": "People around the globe have been moved by the horrible images of Ukrainians in distress, fleeing their homes after the Russian invasion began in late February. But the scope of the situation can be difficult to comprehend.More than a quarter of Ukraine's population has been uprooted since February 24 and more than 4.6 million people have left the country, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It's the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, the UN says.More than 4,500 miles away in Anchorage, Alaska, paramedic-turned-nurse Teresa Gray mobilized to help. Late last month, through her nonprofit , she and several volunteers traveled to Galati, Romania, where they provided care -- and comfort -- to hundreds of Ukrainians.\"These people have lost everything -- their homes, their family members, their country. I knew the hardships they're going through,\" Gray said. \"Because we've done this before, in other countries, I knew that we (could) make a difference for them.\"After creating her nonprofit six years ago, Gray has sent medical teams to natural disasters and refugee crises in the US and around the world. Her organization's work is all done by volunteers, with travel and supplies funded through donations and assistance from other nonprofits.Gray says the group has provided free medical care to more than 30,000 people on five continents. Gray specializes in sending small, mobile teams of four to eight licensed medical volunteers able to go into remote areas -- a need she recognized after working with other groups.\"There's amazing people doing amazing work out there, but they're very stationary. They come in, they set up, and patients come to them. I really saw a need for basically an ambulance-type response,\" she said.When her group members deploy, they're prepared to be entirely self-sustaining. This ensures that they can work for days at a time without taxing the local infrastructure.\"We can bring our own food, our own water, our own sleeping accommodations,\" she said. \"We try to take basically an ambulance in a backpack.\"When they deploy, it's normally within 72 hours of a disaster to fill the gap before larger groups are fully operational. Their missions typically last seven to 10 days.But the Ukraine crisis required a different type of response. Four days after the invasion, one of her volunteers from England began driving along the western border of Ukraine to assess where their help would be most needed. Eventually, they determined that Romania was overwhelmed by refugees but lacked infrastructure other countries, like Poland, had.Going to the border of a war zone raised other concerns.\"This is the most dangerous mission we've ever done,\" Gray told CNN prior to her departure from the US. \"We're taking the necessary medicine for chemical warfare, in case chemical weapons are deployed. But honestly, the heroes are my volunteers who were begging to go.\" Gray's team was told about hundreds of refugees on a university campus who had very limited medical care. When they arrived at the campus in Galati on March 26, Gray was surprised.\"What we were expecting to see was large groups of people housed in tent cities or in large buildings, and actually they are housing these refugees in individual dorm rooms,\" she said. \"They've got food, they've got shelter, but it's still a large group of refugees. The trauma is the same.\"Gray's team staffed a 24-hour clinic and went room to room, caring for the 300 refugees with the help of interpreters. The problems they treated ranged from a flu outbreak among the children to chronic health problems in the elderly, which posed a particular challenge.\"They now exist in a country that doesn't speak your language and doesn't use the same medicine,\" she said. \"So, we're trying to figure out what's your underlying condition, what medication were you on in Ukraine and what is the equivalent in Romania.\"The group also helped organize a warehouse of donated goods, delivered supplies, and cared for other nearby refugees. When one woman, whose elderly mother had been treated for health issues, asked for help -- Gray's volunteers literally went the extra mile.\"She asked us if we would drive her to the border so (she) and her son could see Ukraine, maybe for the last time,\" Gray said. \"She asked us for help, so we gave it to her. \"That interaction embodies Gray's approach to her work.\"It isn't just about fixing the broken arm or giving you medicine. It's making that human connection,\" she said. \"Human suffering has no borders. People are people ... and love is love. \"CNN's Kathleen Toner spoke with Gray about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.How did you find your way into the medical field? Growing up in Michigan, my godmother was a paramedic instructor, and she would drag me down to the firehouse and make me be a mock victim. I would have to be bandaged and splinted and all sorts of things while they practiced their skills. I loved it. After high school, I stumbled across an ad for an EMT, and I thought, \"I'll go give it a shot,\" and it all made sense to me. I knew in that moment I had found my career. I started as an EMT, became a paramedic. Eventually I moved to Alaska and ended up being a critical-care flight paramedic. Our cities are hundreds of miles apart, so our ambulances are Lear jets. We fly to the villages, pick people up and bring them back to major cities. I've picked up patients in dogsleds, on snow machines -- whatever we needed to do to make it happen, I've tried all the different avenues of paramedicine. I've loved them all. Now I'm a registered nurse, but I also still hold my paramedic license. What led you to get involved in disaster response work? In late 2015, I had semi-retired. I was a stay-at-home mom, and I was watching TV and I saw the  on the beach of Lesbos face down in the water. I had not really been aware of what was going on over in Greece or the Syrian refugee crisis. And so I just decided that I was going to go to Greece and see if I could help. It was life-changing. These people were stepping off the boats, soaking wet, hypothermic. It was heartbreaking. But I made a difference for people. In addition to natural and humanitarian disasters, your group also does medical sustainability missions.  We will find communities that are chronically medically underserved, and we ask them to commit five years to building their own medical infrastructure, and we support them during that time. We've done that with the Philippines very successfully. We normally go in twice a year and we give them the equipment, the supplies, the medications they need, and the ongoing training. And then we also mentor them and support them through telemedicine. When we first started going to a remote island in the Philippines, they had a huge population of cleft-palate babies being born, just simply because their nutrition wasn't good. Within three years, we eliminated cleft-palate babies on that island by giving out prenatal vitamins. That's all it took -- but that's what it took. So that's what we do. It doesn't matter what you need, if we can provide that for you, we will.To donate to Mobile Medics International via GoFundMe, ",

        "content": "The Walt Disney Company, a longtime engine of Florida's economy, now finds itself in a disorienting position: Enemy of Florida's governor . And let's be clear about the root cause: Resistance to LGBTQ equality.The impending removal of Walt Disney World's special tax district is wrapped up in anti-big business rhetoric. But the chain of events that led to \"DeSantis versus Disney\" began with the Florida GOP's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law.Homophobia and hate are right underneath the surface of the high-minded talking points about \"parental rights in education.\"Of course parents have rights-âbut right-wing media stars and conservative lawmakers are galvanizing viewers and voters by demonizing transgender teachers and condemning inclusive Disney shows.The most incendiary commentators throw around terms like \"child abuse\" and accuse opponents of \"grooming\" kids for sexual predation, sometimes by taking a teacher's comments grossly out of context, or acting like one outspoken educator represents an entire profession.It is a conservative backlash to growing acceptance of gay and transgender people, with entire networks and websites programming to a fear that conservative beliefs are being trampled on.\"We're seeing these issues weaponized all over the country,\" Democratic political strategist David Axelrod said on CNN Wednesday night.Florida is one of the focal points. When Republicans in the state pushed the \"parental rights\" bill that came to be known as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law earlier this year, a wide variety of opponents said the law could hurt the LGBTQ community by creating a chilling effect. , the state's largest private employer, did not initially take a public stance against the bill, which infuriated LGBTQ employees and allies.The internal revolt prompted both an apology and an adjustment by Disney CEO Bob Chapek. His professed support for those employees and his halt to political donations in Florida provoked stark criticism from Republicans in the state. That's when state lawmakers took aim at the unique status that lets Disney operate as an independent government around its Orlando-area theme parks. Taking cues from DeSantis, the GOP-controlled state Senate voted to eliminate Disney's privileges on Wednesday and the state House voted the same way on Thursday.It is a move \"widely seen as retaliation\" by DeSantis and his loyalists,  of The New York Times wrote.The \"Don't Say Gay\" undercurrent is undeniable. Florida Republican state Rep. Randy Fine, who sponsored the tax district bill,  that Disney \"has tried to import California values into Florida.\"Fine also implored the company to remember that \"they are a guest in our state\" and said \"if you want special privileges, you'd better be on your best behavior.\" The expected change would not take effect until June 2023, more than a year from now. That means Disney will have a lot of time and room to negotiate.Disney, seeing no upside in commenting, has remained silent about the matter. But DeSantis, sensing a political advantage as he plots a 2024 presidential run, is unlikely to let up. \"If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy,\" he asserted in a campaign fundraising email on Wednesday. -- Kadia Goba's framing : \"Florida Republicans are trying to change the narrative around their push to end special incentives for Disney by saying they're protecting free markets, a shift away from what they've explicitly said it's about in the past: retaliation against the company's support of LGBTQ rights...\" -- Colby Itkowitz has a story about this on the front page of Thursday's Washington Post. \"The rapid escalation in public support for the LGBTQ community's rights in recent years had quieted much of the blatant homophobia in the nation's political discourse,\"  \"But, in recent weeks, Republicans have reverted to verbal and legal assaults on the community, sometimes employing baseless tropes that suggest children are being groomed or recruited by defenders of gay rights.\" In short: Call Democrats criminals, garner right-wing media coverage, raise money, win elections...",

In addition to water loss due to an , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.That's enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the , according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.It's bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are  -- if not worsen -- in the coming months.Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead's water level , triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January.And last week, Lake Powell  the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity.The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated.The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.\"It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,\" Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. \"The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.\"",
