        "content": ".A rare blazing orange wildflower that was thought to be extinct for 36 years was rediscovered in South America.The wildflower Gasteranthus extinctus has only been spotted in Ecuador's cloud forest and was last documented in 1985, according to a . The researchers saw a dim future for the flower, so they named it \"extinctus\" because they believed it would soon die out, said coauthor Dawson White, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Field Museum in Chicago.Most of the cloud forest suffered deforestation in the years that followed. The habitat loss was thought to have killed off dozens of species, White said.Researchers decided to take another look in western Ecuador in 2021 to see if there were any patches of forest left and to search for the species that had lived there. Within days, the flower was found, White said. \"It was total elation because Gasteranthus extinctus is a symbol of these unique forests,\" White said. The team gathered samples to later confirm the DNA of the plant, which was scattered in clumps in the small sections of remaining forest. After the magnificent rediscovery, team member Riley Fortier checked the nature app  to see if anyone else had taken a similar photo, White said. A joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, iNaturalist is a biodiversity observation network where people can post photos of plants, birds and other findings in nature for help with identification. The researchers found photos of the wildflower posted in 2019 by a group of Ecuadorian students who had been enjoying an outing in a small conservation area. \"They were out on a trip a little north of where we were collecting and sure enough, they took two pictures of Gasteranthus extinctus, but they weren't able to identify it as such,\" White said.He was able to track down the students to learn more details about their encounter and to include their observations in the scientific paper. Gasteranthus extinctus is not well known in Ecuador, but another member of its family, the African violet, is, said Carmen Ulloa Ulloa, botanist and curator at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. She was not involved in the study.\"Many people probably have an African violet from Africa in their homes, but very few of the Ecuadorian native plants are cultivated for ornamentals,\" she said. While no longer considered extinct, the wildflower is still endangered, White said.Despite the devastation the cloud forest is suffering, the Ecuadorian government continues to destroy the forest for their own gain, which wreaked havoc in that part of the country, he explained. The originally Ecuadorian government redistributed the land to the working class in the 1950s and 1960s, White said.People cut down trees to make way for growing crops like cacao beans and bananas, most of which end up in the United States, he added.\"We were with local landowners, and they told us about their plans to continue to cut down some of these small forests that still remain,\" White said.Ulloa Ulloa grew up in Ecuador and saw firsthand the deforestation, but as she became an adult, she understood the delicate balance of needing to protect the environment while finding ways to make money. \"You need to protect the forest, but then you also need to feed the population of the country,\" Ulloa Ulloa said. One solution is to invest in ecotourism, which invites tourists to enjoy the natural land, she said. It's a way to protect the forest while boosting Ecuador's economy, Ulloa Ulloa explained. Research teams who traveled to Ecuador before and after White's team discovered nearly half a dozen plant species new to science. The teams who discovered the new species are hoping to publish their findings later this year, he said.White's goals are to  while continuing inventory on the newly discovered species, he said.",

        "content": "For 12-year-old Dmytro Keda, after the worst few weeks imaginable, Thursday evening was a dream come true. Keda, who fled his hometown of Mariupol in Ukraine after spending three weeks holed up as Russian forces bombarded the city, came on as a last-minute  in Shakhtar Donetsk's charity friendly  against Poland's Lechia Gdańsk. And in a touching scene, Keda -- having exchanged a few passes with his Shakhtar teammates after coming on -- was put through on goal, slotting home before being mobbed in celebration by players from both teams. Keda was lifted aloft in celebration, with his goal marking the difference in a 3-2 victory for the Ukrainian side. Shakhtar's head coach Roberto De Zerbi  after the match that the decision to let Keda come on and score was \"spontaneous.\" The Ukrainian club's game against Lechia Gdańsk comes as part of the club's 'Global Tour for Peace' which involves playing a number of teams -- including Olympiacos, Fenerbahçe and Hajduk Split -- in a series of charity games.As of April 7, over 1.4 billion Ukrainian hryvnia ($47.2 million) had been donated by the foundation set up by Shakhtar owner Rinat Akhmetov and the team to \"help Ukraine and Ukrainians during the 40 days of the war.\" \"This amount includes humanitarian aid to civilians, as well as assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Territorial Defence force in dozens of cities and towns,\" a  on the club website read. Before Thursday's game at the Polsat Plus Arena, the Ukrainian national anthem was played while a minute of silence was observed for the victims of the war.Players from both teams wore shirts with the message \"Stop war\" emblazoned on the front, with the Shakhtar shirts featuring the names of Ukrainian cities affected by the war. De Zerbi said after the victory in the friendly match that \"football is definitely not paramount for us.\"\"We currently travel around Europe as guests and are grateful to everyone who gives us the opportunity to play in different cities,\" the Italian manager said. \"Today, we are in Poland which is closer to Ukraine. Therefore, of course, it was more emotional. We can say that the two peoples are very similar, and that's why people in the stands were more emotional.\"",

        "content": "The Russian  rests deep beneath the Black Sea this morning.Whether it lies there as the victim of Ukrainian missiles, Russian incompetence, bad luck or a combination of all three is unclear. What is certain, though, is that the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years will raise troubling questions not only for Moscow, but for military planners around the world.The ship sank off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday.Russia's Defense Ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship's stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles and that these sparked the fire that detonated the ammunition.US and Western defense officials seem to favor the Ukrainian account.The US believes with \"medium confidence\" that Ukraine's version of events is accurate, a source familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror on May 2, 1982, during the Falkland Islands war.The General Belgrano and the Moskva were of similar size -- each about 600 feet (182 meters) long and displacing 12,000 tons -- though the crew of about 1,100 aboard the General Belgrano was more than double the size of the Moskva's crew of about 500.Russia has not disclosed the number of casualties occurred during the Moskva's fire and subsequent sinking. A total of 323 crew died when the General Belgrano went down.The biggest effect may be on Russian morale. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war. Though Moscow carefully manages news about the war in Russia, it will be hard to hide the sudden absence of such a large ship. And its loss will raise doubts about Russia's warfighting abilities, whether it was due to enemy action or accident.\"Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies -- either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship,\" analysts Mason Clark, Kateryna Stepanenko, and George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War wrote in their daily war briefing.Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said the doubts went all the way to the Kremlin.\"It raises questions about naval competence 10 years after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin announced he was going to restore the navy's capabilities, morale and professionalism,\" Schuster said.\"It seems he has not been able to keep any of his promises for any of Russia's military services,\" Schuster said, noting  on land too.But analysts are split on what impact the sinking will have on the Russian invasion.The ISW analysts see it as a relatively minor blow, saying the ship was mostly used for cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian logistic centers and airfields. Russia has land-based systems and strike aircraft that can do the same thing, they said.However, they added that if it was indeed a Ukrainian missile that led to the sinking, the Russian navy would have to rethink its operations, possibly moving ships farther from Ukrainian territory and adjusting their air defenses.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Moskva's main mission was air defense for the Russian forces in the Black Sea.\"It will have an impact on that capability, certainly in the near term,\" Kirby told reporters.Analysts say the sinking will be carefully studied in East Asia, especially if it is confirmed that Ukrainian missiles struck the warship.In particular, analysts will be searching for any insight it might offer into any potential military conflict involving Taiwan-- the democratically ruled island that Beijing's ruling Communist Party claims as part of its territory. Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to gain control of Taiwan and this has caused tensions with the US, which is committed to providing the island with defensive weapons.Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp. think tank, said the strike on the Moskva would underscore to both China and the US \"the vulnerability of surface ships\" in any potential military clash.Heath said in such a scenario the US Navy would want to keep its surface ships well out of range of the anti-ship missiles Beijing has amassed on the Chinese mainland.China, on the other hand, would be aware that Taiwan had been acquiring inexpensive anti-ship missiles similar to those Ukraine claims hit the Moskva, Heath and others said.Because of that, \"any potential (Chinese) invasion of Taiwan remains an extremely high risk mission,\" Heath said.But some analysts said the Moskva's sinking has limited relevance for the situation in East Asia. Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander who is now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, said there were too many differences between the situations.The Moskva's air defense systems are not in the same league as the more modern Aegis systems on US Navy destroyers, and Ukrainian anti-ship missiles are not as good as Chinese ones, Shugart said.And Soviet-era warships like the Moskva have been typically \"known for their offensive punch, not for their defensive systems or their damage control,\" Shugart said.",

        "content": "One of the most anticipated family get-togethers in recent royal history took place this week -- and it was kept entirely under wraps.Prince Harry and Meghan stopped by the UK and  on their way to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands, according to a spokesperson for the couple. The visit hadn't been expected by the media and was only confirmed after the pair had left for their next destination. This is the first visit back that we're aware of for Meghan since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex resigned from royal duties in early 2020.Harry returned last year, joining his brother William to unveil a statue of their mother, Diana, at Kensington Palace. But he was chased by photographers and later said it wouldn't be safe for him to return without police protection. , and launched a legal challenge against the government's decision that prevents him from doing so.A statement given to media at the time said Prince Harry \"inherited a security\" from his family. \"He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\"Something must have changed: Maybe the security issue has been resolved, or the secret nature of the visit lowered the risk.Either way, it opens up the possibility that we will see the couple come back more; the most obvious next opportunity would be the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, but nobody on either side is confirming yet whether they'll return for the event.Since the Sussexes left the UK, they have gone out of their way to express their support and respect for the Queen. They've been more critical about Prince Charles, and a rift has clearly developed with the heir to the throne. Back in March last year, it was reported that Harry and his father had \"unproductive\" conversations following his and Meghan's . Two months later, Harry told the Armchair Expert podcast how his childhood felt like being in a \"zoo,\" and hinted that Charles' parenting led him to feel \"some form of pain or suffering.\"CNN understands the couple also met Charles on Thursday, so there could be some positive news there. We don't know what the group spoke about, but it's possible they took the opportunity to clear the air. It was also the first chance for Meghan to speak face-to-face with Charles and her grandmother-in-law since she and Harry quit as active royals.Back then, and again after that dramatic sit-down with Oprah, their decision was met with a whirlwind of controversy and dueling statements from both camps -- though Meghan spoke warmly in the interview of her relationship with the Queen, whom she said has \"always been wonderful to me.\"The foursome would have had plenty to catch up on. The death of the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, brought Harry back to Britain for the funeral. And soon after that visit, Harry and Meghan's second child was born. They gave her the name Lilibet, a nod to the Queen's longtime nickname.The idea of seeing Meghan and Harry back on the Buckingham Palace balcony for a big royal event seemed very unlikely last week. It's slightly more likely now. Every year, like clockwork, the Queen attends the Maundy Service and gives out coins to people who have contributed to the community. The number relates to each year that the Queen has been alive: This year it would have been 96 men and 96 women.But for the first time since 1970, she wasn't able to attend on Thursday after experiencing mobility problems. Initially, everyone expected to see her as the service was on her doorstep at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. However, the organizers were given several days' notice, so she didn't pull out at the last minute. We know the Queen will miss the Easter Service there this Sunday too.She also  which she caught in February. \"It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesn't it?\" she said while meeting virtually with hospital workers.Prince Charles stepped in for his mother at the Maundy Service, as he often has to these days, and it was poignant to see him giving out so many coins to represent the monarch's advanced age.The Queen's 96th birthday is next Thursday; it'll be marked with a 41-gun royal salute in Hyde Park, but the biggest festivities are reserved for her official birthday in June.But the palace is keen to emphasize the Queen is still well enough to conduct matters of state. She is carrying out virtual meetings from her apartments and goes through the official papers that are sent to her every day by her government in that familiar red box.Prince William described himself as a \"stubborn optimist\" while speaking with actress Cate Blanchett and campaigner Danny Kennedy on their Climate of Change podcast. William said progress can be made quicker than people think, \"because the solutions are out there.\" The prince launched the Earthshot Prize in 2020, which awards people or organizations working to battle climate change. The Queen's personal adviser and senior dresser has written in her book that she briefly became the monarch's hairdresser during the UK's Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, the PA Media news agency reported Monday. In an update to her book on serving Her Majesty, Angela Kelly has dedicated an entire chapter to pandemic life in the palace -- a period that has been dubbed \"HMS Bubble\" and saw a reduced household of staff. That meant that the monarch -- like many of us -- had to entrust haircuts to those living in the same home.Canada will welcome Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall in May. The heir to the throne will visit Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada's Capital Region, and the Northwest Territories, where they'll meet with local communities, according to Clarence House. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he's looking forward to \"showing them some of the many reasons why we take pride in being Canadian.\" It's their first trip to Canada since 2017, when they enjoyed a carriage ride through Ottawa and took part in the country's national day celebrations. Official tours by the couple have gained extra importance since Elizabeth II elevated Camilla's future title to \"Queen\" when Charles takes the throne. A showcase of royal portraits of each of the seven ruling British queens will feature in  timed to coincide with Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June. An iconic Armada Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I, which commemorates the failed invasion of England by the Spanish Armada in 1588, will lead the display. It will be joined by Andy Warhol's 1985 \"Reigning Queens\" portrait of Elizabeth II, a richly-colored reinterpretation of the official photographic portrait taken in the Queen's Silver Jubilee year. Warhol created prints of several monarchs that year, but he wasn't too happy when they were displayed in New York City. \"They were supposed to be only for Europe -- nobody here cares about royalty and it'll be another bad review,\" he said in his memoirs.  This year's exhibition, which will run from May 28 to June 15, will also feature key portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots, Queen Victoria, Queen Anne, Mary I and Mary II, lent from aristocratic and other distinguished British collections. Prince William pays tribute to Christiana Figueres, chair of Earthshot's board of trustees, and reveals his hope that progress against climate change is possible while speaking on the Climate of Change podcast.CNN's Hafsa Khalil contributed reporting.",

        "content": ".Astronomers have detected a powerful radiowave laser, known as a megamaser, in space. This record-breaking megamaser is the most distant one ever observed at 5 billion light-years away from Earth. The light from this space laser traveled a whopping 36 thousand billion billion miles (58 thousand billion billion kilometers) to reach our planet. An international team of astronomers, led by Marcin Glowacki, observed this light, using the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory's MeerKAT telescope. (MeerKAT is shorthand for Karoo Array Telescope, preceded by the Afrikaans word for \"more.\") Glowacki is a research associate at the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.Megamasers are created when two galaxies crash into each other. It is the first hydroxyl megamaser that MeerKAT has observed, Glowacki said.Hydroxl, a chemical group consisting of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom, can be found inside galaxy mergers. \"When galaxies collide, the gas they contain becomes extremely dense and can trigger concentrated beams of light to shoot out,\" Glowacki said in a statement. The research team has named the laser Nkalakatha, which means \"big boss\" in isiZulu, the Bantu language of the Zulus in South Africa.The astronomers detected the megamaser on the first night of a survey that spanned more than 3,000 hours of observation time using MeerKAT.\"It's impressive that, with just a single night of observations, we've already found a record-breaking megamaser,\" Glowacki said. \"It shows just how good the telescope is.\"The research team is continuing to use MeerKAT to observe narrow areas in the sky closely and search for the same elements spied in the megamaser. Doing so could provide more insight into how the universe has evolved.\"We have follow-up observations of the megamaser planned and hope to make many more discoveries,\" Glowacki said.The MeerKAT telescope, located in the Karoo region of South Africa, includes an array of 64 radio dishes and has been operational since July 2018. The powerful telescope is sensitive to faint radio light.MeerKAT is a precursor to the transcontinental Square Kilometre Array, or SKA, a telescope under construction in both South Africa and Australia.The array will include thousands of dishes and up to 1 million low-frequency antennas in an effort to build the world's largest radio telescope. Despite the fact that these dishes and antennas will be in different parts of the world, together they will create one telescope that has over 1 square kilometer (0.39 square miles) of collecting area. As a result, astronomers can survey the entire sky much more quickly than with other telescopes.",

        "content": "Four survivors were still hospitalized Thursday, two days  left New Yorkers badly shaken and forced a reckoning over passenger security on thein the country.Mayor Eric Adams is due to hold a virtual news conference Friday to thank frontline workers for their handling of the shooting and its aftermath.In court Thursday, Frank James, 62, was denied bail and did not enter a plea on charges of violating a law that prohibits terrorism and violent attacks on mass transportation. He was arrested a day earlier in Manhattan's East Village after  to police; hours earlier, a teenager had  to report seeing him.Police say James boarded a train during Tuesday morning's rush in Brooklyn, set off smoke grenades and fired a gun 33 times, shooting 10 people.Twenty-nine people were sent to hospitals, including the 10 who were shot and 19 others who suffered injuries mostly related to smoke inhalation, falling down or having a panic attack, officials said. The four people still hospitalized Thursday were in stable condition, according to hospital representatives.While officials have not released a motive for one of the most violent attacks to occur on the city's subway system, they have pointed to  in which James shares his views on violence, mass shootings and mental health. James, who's Black, says in the videos that he suffered from post-traumatic stress and supported hatred of African Americans and other people he believed had maligned him. In a video posted in February, he criticizes a plan by Adams' administration to address , saying it was \"doomed to fail.\"City officials want to enhance security in the subway system, the mayor told CNN on Wednesday, noting the process would entail examining technology that could detect whether somebody is carrying a gun.\"But it is extremely challenging to identify every person that enters the subway system because of the ,\" he said.On the day of the shooting, more than 3 million people rode the system, which also includes passengers who used the Staten Island Railway,  the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. At James' hearing Thursday, Assistant US Attorney Sara Winik described the attack as \"premeditated and carefully planned.\" Prosecutors also argued James was a flight risk and a danger to the community, according to a letter submitted by US Attorney Breon Peace to a federal judge.\"The defendant committed a premediated mass shooting on the New York City subway system and then fled the scene, with a stockpile of ammunition and other dangerous items stowed in his storage unit,\" the letter says.Defense attorney Mia Eisner-Grynberg cautioned against a rush to judgment. \"We are all still learning about what happened on that train,\" she said outside the courthouse. \"What we do know is this: Yesterday, Mr. James saw his photograph on the news. He called Crime Stoppers to help. He told them where he was. Initial press and police reports in cases like this one are often inaccurate. Mr. James is entitled to a fair trial, and we will ensure that he receives one.\"The shooting James is accused of carrying out took place as a train was traveling from the 59th Street station to 36th Street station in Brooklyn just before 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.The suspected shooter was wearing a yellow hard hat, an orange reflective jacket and a surgical mask as he set off at least one smoke device and began shooting at people with a Glock pistol, according to a criminal complaint. Witnesses saw the suspect wearing a gas mask, the complaint stated. the smoke engulfing the train by running to one end of the car. The doors wouldn't open until two minutes later, when the train reached the 36th Street station, and passengers fled the train as the smoke followed them, video shows. Other victims with bloody wounds fell to the platform as they shouted for medical care. Blood streaked the subway platform, with people sitting and lying on the platform, photos taken at the scene show.James was initially named a person of interest after authorities determined he rented a U-Haul van whose keys were found at the scene. Investigators declared him a suspect Wednesday morning after they learned he bought a gun that was left at the scene. Authorities found a bag containing the Glock handgun, a plastic container with gasoline, a torch, the U-Haul key and multiple bank cards, as well as another bag containing fireworks, the complaint states.James bought the gun in Ohio in 2011, the bank cards had James' name on them and the U-Haul key was connected to a van James had rented in Philadelphia, according to the complaint.A neon construction jacket left on the subway platform had a receipt for a storage unit in Philadelphia registered to James, the complaint states.Federal prosecutors believe he went to the storage facility filled with ammunition and weapons the evening before the attack, according to court documents. A search of the unit revealed additional ammunition and \"a threaded 9mm pistol barrel that allows for a silencer or suppressor to be attached.\"Hours before James was arrested, Jack Griffin, 17, said he was on a field trip with his high school photography class when he spotted the suspect sitting on a bench on Manhattan's Lower East Side.Griffin submitted the tip to NYPD's Crime Stoppers around 10:30 a.m. And although James wasn't captured for several more hours, the NYPD later told him the tip helped narrow their net of his whereabouts, he said.\"It's crazy,\" he said. \"I was looking for things to shoot (with a camera), and I found probably one of the most wanted people.\"CNN's Caroll Alvarado, Chris Boyette, Travis Caldwell, Alaa Elassar, Rob Frehse, Jason Hanna, Chris Hippensteel, Artemis Moshtaghian, Paul P.

        "content": "China has begun sending its most advanced fighter aircraft, , to patrol the East and , Chinese state media has reported.Early versions of the J-20 stealth jet used Russian engines -- but those have since been replaced with domestically-produced twin engines. The jets were first shown to the public with the new Chinese engines last year at Airshow China.The deployment is intended to \"better safeguard China's airspace security and maritime interests,\" state-run tabloid reported on Wednesday, citing military experts. Ren Yukun, a spokesperson for the J-20's state-run manufacturer, added that it was a \"training routine\" for the J-20 to begin conducting patrols now that it's equipped with Chinese engines, according to Global Times.The announcement comes just weeks after United States Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, the commander of US Pacific Air Forces, said US F-35s and Chinese J-20s came into close proximity with each other over the East China Sea.The East China Sea and South China Sea have both long been contested regions, with overlapping territorial claims by numerous countries.China claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building up and militarizing its facilities there, turning islands into , and allegedly creating a  that could number in the hundreds of boats.Meanwhile in the East China Sea, China claims sovereignty over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands. In recent years, the US has reiterated its promise to defend the Japanese islands in the event of foreign aggression.Experts say the deployment of the J-20s shows two things: China's increased confidence in its military abilities, and its warning to other countries with a stake in the territorial dispute.With some 200 J-20s reportedly in service, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) \"now has in regular service a fleet of advanced stealth fighters as good as the Americans, who remain the benchmark,\" said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia. He added that China's message to the world is: \"Any foreign military aircraft intruding into China's claimed airspace in the East and South China Sea may now be intercepted by J-20s.\"While such a move would be politically fraught, the J-20's wide radius of action means it could patrol further out to sea, or stay longer in areas like the East China Sea, Layton said. Small formations, such as a handful of jets, could also conduct occasional deep patrols into the South China Sea, land to refuel at one of China's island airbases, then return to the mainland. The PLAAF could even launch missions to overfly any US carrier battle groups that enter the South China Sea.The transition from Russian to Chinese engines also shows China's growing independence in military manufacturing, Layton said. \"It's not just that China does not need Russian help anymore, it is that Chinese-built aircraft are now superior to Russia.\"The fact that the J-20s now have more reliable twin engines than the Russian ones makes these patrols \"a much more plausible option,\" which could be why they hadn't been sent on patrol before, said Layton.The J-20 has long been touted as China's answer to the American F-22 -- considered the world's premier stealth fighter jet -- and the F-35.A 2017 report by the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the new Chinese engines would give the J-20 low supercruise ability, meaning they could fly at supersonic speeds for prolonged periods.US officials have long said the J-20 can't stack up to US stealth fighters -- but Wilsbach, the US Pacific Air Forces commander, said last month that the J-20s made a strong impression when they encountered US F-35s over the East China Sea.\"We're relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20s,\" Wilsbach said at a  for Aerospace Studies conference.The US observed \"relatively professional flying\" by the Chinese aviators, he said, but noted the US was unsure how China would employ the J-20s, whether in multi-mission roles like the F-35 or in an air superiority role like the F-22.Layton said the US, Japan and other countries will be \"keenly collecting electronic intelligence data\" on any J-20s out on coastal patrols, hoping to gather more information on its stealth characteristics, as well as any radio and datalink transmissions.",

        "content": "As Russia faces unprecedented sanctions on virtually all sectors of its economy, it may have to turn to a trusted ally with more than four decades of experience with Western embargoes.   Until the Ukraine war, Iran was the most sanctioned country in the world, according to  which tracks sanctions. Russia now holds that record and the two countries are in what analysts call \"a marriage of convenience\" that is likely to grow stronger as the war in Ukraine escalates. \"Common interests in helping the other evade sanctions are important to these dynamics in Russia-Iran relations,\" said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics in Washington DC. Amid tit-for-tat air blockades between Moscow and the West last month, Russian transport minister Vitaly Savelyev said is \"studying the case of Iran\" to help it deal with sanctions on maintenance and spare parts. Iran still operates some planes purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ruptured its ties with the West. \"This bilateral relationship will likely grow stronger as the war in Ukraine rages on, especially if the Vienna talks fail to revive the JCPOA,\" Cafiero added, referring to the 2015 deal that put verifiable limits on Iran's nuclear program designed to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He noted that Iran's isolation will further push Tehran to make itself useful to the Kremlin.     After decades of Western economic constraints, the Islamic Republic has become a master of evasion, using illicit markets and manipulating vessel-tracking to circumvent sanctions. Today, Russia is living a similar crisis as the West clamps down on Moscow in an effort to cripple its war effort. Can Russia follow Iran's lead to circumvent Western sanctions? Some analysts say it already is. The US, the G7 group of rich nations, and the European Union have imposed a series of unprecedented  on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The largest blow, however, would be to Russian energy, which by 2020 made up  of Russia's exports. The US and Britain have already banned Russian oil. Today, the EU -- which remains highly dependent on Russia's supply -- is considering a similar move, but is yet to reach consensus on the matter. One way Russia can learn to survive potential sanctions on its oil is to shift vessels and rebrand its blend, a tactic that has been used by Iran.  Iran has in the past  millions of oil barrels off little-known ports in Asia to escape Western sanctions, Reuters reported in 2012. Barrel transfers in the dead of night from one vessel to another allowed Iran to masquerade under different flags, selling its oil to keen Asian buyers without catching the eye of Western monitors. Iran didn't respond to a request for comment, Reuters added. \"About 8% of the world's largest tankers are now engaged in the smuggling of sanctioned oil, largely comprising Iranian and Venezuelan product,\" said Cormac Mc Garry, security expert at Control Risks in London.   \"Ghosting\" is the most commonly used mechanism, Mc Garry told CNN, whereby ships turn off their automatic identification systems as they switch cargo from one vessel to another. \"The trick here is that the second tanker may look completely compliant [with sanctions], and the trader or consumer can be duped into thinking they have purchased an unsanctioned cargo,\" said Mc Garry. Windward, an Israeli maritime intelligence company, said that over the past month it identified Russian crude trading under the radar, where there were ship-to-ship operations between oil tankers departing from Russian ports with other oil tankers. Tankers engaged in this activity arrived in North America, Asia, Russia and Europe, according to Windward.  \"While the new restrictions are changing vessel behaviors ... it seems like some companies are maintaining business as usual, by concealing their actions and trying to keep regulatory bodies ... in the dark,\"  Windward in a blog post. In Iran's case, remote Malaysian territories were used as \"blending\" or \"re-branding\" spots, where Iranian oil would be mixed with others and sold as a non-Iranian product to international buyers. \"\" have been a known gateway to evading oil sanctions, with Asian buyers -- specifically Chinese -- making use of the rebranded mix to purchase sanctioned oil. Russia is already taking a similar route, its oil now rebranded as \"Latvian blend\" -- a 49.99%-Russian mix that is blended with other oil and labelled Latvian. The crude has been bought by UK-based oil and gas company Shell, Bloomberg .  Dealing with sanctioned oil risks both reputational and financial damage, but demand for crude could still drive some buyers to the deep ends of black markets, analysts say. \"Commodities markets are already being squeezed due to supply concerns and so it is not clear that Russian supplies can be replaced,\" said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation think tank in London. Financially, Iran has built a shadowy network that uses front companies and circuitous transactions to launder money and dodge sanctions, analysts say, which some believe may be offered for Russian use. Those companies are used to give the appearance that there is no Iran connection, said Richard Nephew, a scholar at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy in New York who previously serves as deputy sanctions chief at the State Department and director of Iranian Affairs at the US National Security Council. Front companies are a tactic that Nephew believes Russia would be keen to learn from. \"I think that Iran would be prepared to help Russia with respect to some sanctions evasion tools,\" said Nephew, \"but of course, this assumes that Iran itself has access that it can make readily available.\" Sanction evasion is not an easy task, said Batmanghelidj. And while finding complicit partners delays economic collapse in the short-term, it still cuts the chances of long-term profit.  \"The main lesson that Russian should draw from Iran's experience is that evading sanctions and resisting sanctions is hard,\" said Batmanghelidj. \"At best, Russia can aim to demonstrate resilience to sanctions, but that just means staving a runaway economic collapse,\" he told CNN. \"This is why the real cost of sanctions is an opportunity cost of forgone growth.\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after speaking to his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that Tehran \"stands against Russia's war on Ukraine\" and \"supports a diplomatic solution.\" He also said that Iran refuted allegations that arms were transferred to Russia with the help of Iranian companies.  The US Navy said on Wednesday it is establishing a task force that will help combat arms smuggling in the waters around Yemen.  Palestinians and Israeli forces clashed in and around the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem's Old City, marking a significant spike in tensions on what is a day of significance for all three of the city's main religions. At least 150 people were taken to hospitals with injuries from rubber bullets, stun grenades and police beatings, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.  Blistering hot car steering wheel and bursts of hot air at every exit from an air-conditioned refuge, UAE residents are getting a reminder of what desert heat feels like as the weather in the Gulf country turns.    One digital artist in Dubai, however, has used art and technology to let residents fantasize about a UAE with more green than the orange of sand dunes that residents are used to seeing.   Jyo John Mulloor visualizes the desert country in sage, jade, olive, and every other shade of green as he drapes key landmarks like the Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa with forests all around. The pictures, which took 26 days to create, have gone viral on social media. This was Mulloor's sequel to his #letitsnow series where he imagined the city covered in snow.  Calling it the #letitbloom project, the renderings of a greener Dubai aren't an entirely unfamiliar sight. Mulloor says he was inspired by Dubai's ambitious plan to make the desert bloom in a similar way, telling CNN that while his previous project, #letitsnow, was a dream, #letitbloom is a vision. One that he shares with the top royal in Dubai.   In April last year, Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashed Al Maktoum launched the \"Dubai 2040 urban master plan,\" which aims to double green and recreational places in the city as well as dedicate 60% of the emirate's total area to nature reserves and rural areas.   While Mulloor admits his renderings are an exaggeration of the 2040 vision, he believes Dubai can transform up to 60% of what his artworks depicted. \"If anyone in the world can do it, Dubai can do it,\" he says.    Elon Musk took a jab at Saudi Arabia on Twitter after his recent bid to purchase all outstanding shares of the social media platform for $43 billion was rejected by a royal shareholder.  According to a regulatory filing on Thursday, Musk offered to buy all outstanding shares of Twitter for $54.20 per share. If what he called \"my best and final offer\" is rejected, Musk said he will need to reconsider his position as a shareholder. Musk currently owns a 9.1% stake in Twitter. Saudi prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, one of the world's richest men who holds 5.2% of Twitter shares, took to his 14.2 million followers to say he doesn't believe Musk's offer \"comes close to the intrinsic value\" of Twitter. Musk responded by asking Al Waleed how much of Twitter Saudi Arabia owns, publicly and privately, as well as about the kingdom's views on freedom of speech.  Al Waleed is yet to respond.  ",

The texts, which have not been previously reported, were sent by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The text exchanges show that both members of Congress initially supported legal challenges to the election but ultimately came to sour on the effort and the tactics deployed by Trump and his team.   \"We're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic,\" Roy texted Meadows on January 1. That text was first  by the House select committee and described as being written by a House Freedom Caucus member. Roy's authorship has not been previously reported. When situated in the overall timeline of events between the election and January 6, the series of texts from Lee and Roy provide new details about how two Trump allies went from fierce advocates of the former President's  to disheartened bystanders. By January 3, Lee was texting Meadows that the effort \"could all backfire badly.\" But shortly after the election, both men were encouraging Trump to keep fighting.  In a series of texts to Meadows on November 7, Lee offered his \"unequivocal support for you to exhaust every legal and constitutional remedy at your disposal to restore Americans faith in our elections.\"Lee went on: \"This fight is about the fundamental fairness and integrity of our election system. The nation is depending upon your continued resolve. Stay strong and keep fighting Mr. President.\"Also on November 7, Roy wrote to Meadows, \"We need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend.\"In a statement to CNN, Lee's communications director, Lee Lonsberry, said, \"I'd like to highlight that Senator Lee has been fully transparent,\" pointing to how Lee had called for an investigation into claims of fraud in the 2020 election but ultimately recognized Biden as president-elect and voted to certify the electoral results on January 6. Roy Communications Director Nate Madden told CNN the text messages \"speak for themselves.\"An attorney for Meadows did not respond to CNN's request for comment.A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment.A source familiar with the committee's work tells CNN that Lee's texts \"reflect he was a cheerleader before he was against it. He uses legal language to push blatant conspiracy theorists into the Trump orbit.\"Over a few days in November, Lee lobbied Meadows to get attorney \"Sydney Powell is saying that she needs to get in to see the president, but she's being kept away from him,\" Lee wrote to Meadows on November 7. \"Apparently she has a strategy to keep things alive and put several states back in play. Can you help get her in?\"Lee then sent Meadows Powell's cell number and her email.  On November 9, Lee again pressed Meadows about Powell, calling her a \"straight shooter.\" That same day, Roy warned Meadows about Trump's approach, texting him, \"We must urge the President to tone down the rhetoric, and approach the legal challenge firmly, intelligently and effectively without resorting to throwing wild desperate haymakers or whipping his base into a conspiracy frenzy.\"Then came the  on November 19, where members of Trump's legal team -- including Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- laid out a series of false claims and conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud.   The messages started to take on a more critical tone. \"Hey brother - we need substance or people are going to break,\" Roy texted on November 19, a few hours after the news conference wrapped.  Two hours later, Lee texted Meadows with serious concerns, saying he was \"worried about the Powell press conference.\" Lee told Meadows, \"The potential defamation liability for the president is significant here.\"For the campaign and for the president personally.\"Unless Powell can back up everything she said, which I kind of doubt she can.\"Meadows responded, \"I agree. Very concerned.\"The news conference came as  in his effort to challenge the results in key swing states. By late November, Lee had shifted away from Powell and started promoting , who a federal judge in California said last month may have been planning a crime with Trump as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election, calling it \"a coup in search of a legal theory.\"Privately Roy was also texting Meadows with support for Eastman, and criticizing Giuliani.\"Have you talked to John Eastman?\" Roy texted on November 22. \"Get Eastman to file in front of pa board of elections...\"Get data in front of public domain.\"Frigging rudy needs to hush.\"   By December, both Republican lawmakers express grave concerns to Meadows about the plan to challenge the certification of the election on January 6. On December 16, Lee asked Meadows for guidance: \"If you want senators to object, we need to hear from you on that ideally getting some guidance on what arguments to raise.\"I think we're now passed the point where we can expect anyone will do it without some direction and a strong evidentiary argument.\" On December 31 Roy expressed even more concern in a text to Meadows. \"The president should call everyone off. It's the only path. If we substitute the will of states through electors with a vote by congress every 4 years... we have destroyed the electoral college... Respectfully,\" Roy wrote.By this time, Trump and his allies were working behind the scenes to enlist portions of the federal government in the effort to overturn the election. That included urging Justice Department officials, including then-Attorney General William Barr, to investigate fraud even after the agency had declared there was none. Trump was also putting heavy pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election on January 6. In a January 3 text to Meadows, Lee argued that Trump's effort to have states send alternate slates of electors to Congress was not legitimate. \"I only know that this will end badly for the President unless we have the Constitution on our side,\" Lee texted in a note to Meadows. \"And unless these states submit new slates of Trump electors pursuant to state law, we do not,\" Lee wrote to Meadows. As CNN has previously reported, the plan to replace authentic electors with fake ones in a handful of swing states was orchestrated by allies of the former President and overseen by his then-attorney Giuliani.  None of those alternate slates of pro-Trump electors received sign-off from state officials or were put before Congress.  While Lee and Roy both voted to certify the electoral results in favor of Biden, more than 100 of their GOP colleagues in both the House and Senate did not. Chief among them were Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, both of whom Lee called out in his texts to Meadows. \"I have grave concerns with the way my friend Ted is going about this effort,\" Lee wrote to Meadows. \"This will not inure to the benefit of the president.\"Lee added that unless new, competing slates of electors were put forward in accordance with state law, the net effect \"could help people like Ted and Josh to the detriment of DJT.\"When January 6 finally came, neither Lee nor Roy joined their colleagues in objecting to the 2020 presidential election results.  After the violence unfolded and Congress returned to session, Roy said on the House floor, \"The President should never have spun up certain Americans to believe something that simply cannot be.\"  He also texted Meadows, \"This is a sh*tshow.\"Fix this now.\"  ",

The list of atrocities and apparent war crimes allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine gets longer by the day. As Ukrainians reclaim areas previously occupied by invading Russian troops, evidence of the horrors of recent weeks is emerging from the rubble of shattered villages and towns. New victims are discovered on a daily basis. And those lucky enough to have survived the ordeal tell harrowing tales of kidnappings, rapes and torture. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said Monday that her office is investigating 5,800 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with \"more and more\" proceedings opening every day. Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians. But CNN journalists on the ground in Ukraine have seen firsthand evidence of atrocities at multiple locations across the country. Here is what we saw.Novyi and Staryi Bykiv are two tiny specks on the map, separated by a small stream. Together they form a sleepy community of about 2,000 people that you'd expect few Ukrainians -- let alone the Russian army -- to be familiar with.Katerina Andrusha told me that's why her daughter Victoria decided to leave her apartment in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary and come back here at the start of the war; she believed it would be safer at home.But on February 27, residents say Russian forces rolled into the neighboring villages, turned the local school into their base, vandalized and looted homes and terrorized the people here for five weeks.On March 25, Katerina said Russian soldiers came to her home and took Victoria, claiming she had information about their forces on her phone.Three days later, Katerina herself was taken captive. She said she was held in a cellar for three days. Blindfolded and terrified, she tried to find out what had happened to her daughter.\"They told me she was in a warm house and that she was working with them and would be home soon,\" said Katerina.She said she hasn't seen Victoria since. As she spoke to us, Katerina's gaze drifted skyward in disbelief. She showed us pictures of her daughter, a beautiful schoolteacher.\"We hope that she will get in touch with someone, somewhere,\" she said.Just a few streets away, we met another mother. Olga Yavon's grief was raw and all-consuming. She knew why we were there and the moment she came out to greet us, she broke down in tears.Her boys, Igor, 32, and Oleg, 33, are among six of the village's young men who authorities say were executed by Russian soldiers on February 27.She told us Russian forces rounded them up after a bridge nearby was blown up.The Russians kept hold of their bodies for nine days before dumping them on the outskirts of the village, with instructions to bury them quickly, she said.\"They were very good boys,\" Olga said. \"How I want to see them again.\"I have seen a lot of awful things in my career, but some of the things we were confronted with on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian troops were beaten back by Ukrainian forces have been among the most harrowing. In the suburb of Bucha we were among the first to reach a  that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.We saw half-buried bodies, legs and arms sticking out of the earth. We met  here; he broke down and could not stop crying. The neighbor who comforted him was also in tears. These moments of heartbreak are difficult to witness -- they make you want to cry as well.Also in Bucha, we were led into a  -- the Ukrainians say the men had been executed by Russian troops. Some had their hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head or the heart.You could still see the horror on their faces. It seemed like the dead wanted the truth of their violent death to be uncovered.No matter how many bodies you see, you never forget a single one.At 10:30 a.m. last Friday as many as 4,000 people in and around the  were waiting to be evacuated when a missile exploded overhead, raining down chunks of metal. Shrapnel ripped through the crowd, which was largely composed of women, children and the elderly. The latest death toll is more than 50, with more than 100 injured. When we , we found the concourse still stained with blood, littered with the scattered possessions of the dead and wounded. On one platform, we found a large pool of congealed blood in a shrapnel impact point with several false teeth nearby. Someone, probably an elderly person, must have been hit and killed there. City officials believe Kramatorsk could be surrounded, besieged and pulverized by Russian forces if and when the much-anticipated offensive in the east gathers pace. The mayor had been urging residents to leave, and prior to Friday's strike around 8,000 people a day were boarding westbound trains. The evacuation effort had been publicly announced, with people from surrounding towns and villages urged to gather at the railway station in Kramatorsk, which was the major regional hub. There was nothing secret about it.  Russia has , claiming the missile -- a Tochka-U -- is no longer used by Russian forces, and alleging that it was a Ukrainian missile that hit the station. Military analysts dismiss the claim.Part of the missile crashed into a small park in front of the station. Someone, somewhere wrote on it in Russian \"for the children.\"While tagging and writing slogans on missiles, bombs and shells is a very old tradition, it is not for certain what the intended message was.  The worst thing I have seen since arriving in Kyiv nearly a month ago would have to be the body of a man we were shown in a , northwest of Kyiv.We were led to the site by the owner of the house, who had fled town in the first few days of war. She returned as the invading troops withdrew, only to find her home had been ransacked by Russian soldiers. Behind her garden shed, she showed us a man, with a bag over his head, his hands tied behind his back and his trousers pulled down, exposing his underwear and heavily bruised leg. He had a gunshot wound to the head, and a single bullet case was still lying next to his body.He appeared to have been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers, although we do not know for sure what happened to him.By this time, we had already seen the now infamous mass grave in Bucha, but the image of that man has stuck with me -- I find the individual more relatable than the collective. It is easier to compartmentalize, to dissociate a group from the humanity they were robbed of.I keep thinking about that man and who he might have been. Did he suffer? Did he have a family? What were his ambitions? What led him to that backyard? Did he fight back, did he protest against the Russian occupation? What if it had been me — or my brother, who was living in Kyiv when the invasion started?This man is one atrocity too many. And then you realize there are countless others, still waiting to be found, underneath some rubble, in a shallow grave or in someone else's backyard.",

He lived among \"healers\" with his wife in Costa Rica but is aware not everyone will be able to understand his journey. \"A lot of people call some of the things that I've embarked upon as hallucinogenic, but the way I see them is so much different,\" Hoffmann added. \"I think it's like a backdoor or side door to different dimensions or different planes. I don't really have it down yet; I'm still questioning and trying to figure it all out.\"Hoffmann needs 238.420 or more FedExCup points to remain in the major medical category for the rest of the year and has three starts left to get them.

        "subtitle": "• Chinese officials are 'painfully aware' of economic fallout from lockdowns: European Chamber President",
        "content": "Across China, cities are locking down their residents, supply lines are rupturing, and officials are scrambling to secure the movement of basic goods -- as its  threatens to spiral into a national crisis of the government's own making.At least 44 Chinese cities are under either a full or partial lockdown as authorities persist in trying to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, according to a report from investment bank Nomura and CNN's own reporting as of Thursday. In Shanghai, the , scenes once unimaginable for the hyper-modern financial capital have become part of the daily struggle for 25 million people. There, residents  the confines of their apartments or housing blocks for weeks have been desperate for food and freedom -- some seen in social media clips screaming out of their windows in frustration or clashing with hazmat-clad workers. Even after the release of a tentative plan Monday for the partial relaxation of measures, there appears to be no end in sight.The current situation may mark the most significant challenge for the country -- and, arguably, for Chinese leader Xi Jinping -- since the initial outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan over two years ago. And for Xi, it comes at a particularly sensitive time, months before his expected step into a  in power at the twice-a-decade Party Congress this fall.The stakes are high for the leader -- China's most powerful in decades -- as he has placed his personal stamp firmly on the  driving these unbending measures, where even a small number of cases can spark sweeping disease controls. \"We need to overcome paralysis in the face of risk, war-weariness, leaving things to chance and becoming relaxed,\" state media reported Xi saying Wednesday, calling on the nation to \"strictly implement normalized prevention and control measures.\" In China, the local officials rolling out Covid-19 measures, like those in Shanghai, typically get blamed for mismanagement when there are problems -- a more acceptable target than the central government and its policies, in the country's tightly controlled political environment. And it's not expected that a Covid crisis will imperil Xi's likely third term. But as the outbreak enters a critical phase -- with some  and a top national health official warning Tuesday that Shanghai's outbreak had \"not been effectively contained\" -- China's ruling Communist Party and its leader will have to grapple with the economic fallout and the growing possibility that, like the virus,  seen in Shanghai could spread. Xi has ordered local officials to do all they can to stop the virus, while also minimizing the \"impact on economic and social development\" -- an order that, counter-intuitively, is expected to push local officials to clamp down with harsh measures at the sign of a few cases, or even preemptively, in the wake of the crisis in Shanghai.\"Shanghai officials were trying to thread this needle they've been asked to thread, which is, 'let's maintain zero-Covid, while also not disrupting anybody's life.' They focused a little bit more on the 'not disrupting people's lives' (side). And they failed,\" said Trey McArver, partner and co-founder at the China policy research group Trivium.\"The lesson that everybody's going to learn is that, actually, you really have to focus on the zero-Covid part,\" he said.As of Tuesday, health authorities said more than 320,000 local Covid-19 cases had been reported across 31 provinces, including those in Shanghai, since March 1. Already dozens of cities have some form of lockdown, even though the vast majority of those total cases have been found in Shanghai and the northeastern province of Jilin. Getting supplies across the country has become a steep challenge, with some expressways closed, and truck drivers ensnared in quarantine or at thousands of highway hevalth checkpoints. Some cities have discouraged their residents from leaving, like the major southern port of Guangzhou, which requires its 18 million people to show a negative Covid test if they want to get out. \"You could basically say the whole country now is like a large number of isolated islands,\" said , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.The situation has spurred various ministries in Beijing into action, with a National Development and Reform Commission official pledging Tuesday to \"actively coordinate with local governments\" and \"employ big data\" to ensure essentials get delivered. Meanwhile, health officials and state media have amped up public messaging on why China must stick to the policy, citing the risks, especially to its , of a widespread outbreak in the country of 1.4 billion. Those health concerns come alongside a \"hidden\" political calculation of the costs of a large-scale outbreak, according to Huang.\"(Beijing is) considering the perceived impact on political and social economic stability, considering the impact on the leadership transition ahead of the Party Congress, and considering the regime legitimacy -- there is a lot at stake,\" said Huang. But the risks for the Communist Party of keeping the policy, which has sparked mounting frustration and anger in Shanghai and threatens more disruption, is also clear -- especially as the country is over 88% vaccinated and most cases, authorities say, remain mild.\"Economic slowdown is quite a big concern,\" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor in the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore.\"The central government always utilizes so-called economic performance to enhance their legitimacy. So how are they going to (explain) sluggish economic performance? I don't know. But one thing is very sure, people will be suffering.\"With Xi's name so closely associated with the policies, the leader has linked himself to their success.\"When you've so clearly centralized power in one person's hands, then I think you can plausibly lay any problems at that person's feet -- so it obviously reflects poorly on him,\" said McArver.But as for whether this would imperil the leader's third term, \"the answer is no,\" he said, pointing to what observers of China's opaque elite politics widely believe to be a void of any real competition for the top role. Meanwhile, it's possible that even from the depths of the current challenge -- if they can find a way to bring the outbreaks largely under control -- the central government could spin a political win, akin to what they did in Wuhan in 2020, analysts say.Then, there was significant anger against the government, for example following the death of the , but China's Communist Party emerged from the crisis to paint its stringent control strategy as an . There has been clear frustration against the government this time around, spilling onto social media this week as users adopted pro-China, trending hashtags en masse to make veiled or sarcastic comments against the government -- before being censored.But there are also ready scapegoats across the country in the form of local government officials, who are under enormous pressure and can be blamed for failures in the implementation of the \"zero-Covid\" policy, shifting fault away from the central government's policy itself, experts say. Many cadres have been fired or demoted throughout the pandemic, including recently in Shanghai, with details typically reported by state media.\"The Chinese central government is very, very careful and also very, very smart in turning the anger on the local governments instead of themselves,\" said Wu.And in a political environment where all dissent is quashed, the narrative of Xi's Party will dominate.However, some argue that China has painted itself into a corner where it now needs to uphold its stringent policy, after reveling for two years in the success of \"zero-Covid,\" while scaremongering about the virus and generating broad support for the policy.Huang puts it this way: \"We should never underestimate the government capacity to redefine its narrative to sustain the public support. And we should never underestimate the people's tolerance, even for policies that harm their interest.\"CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Despite the enticing subtitle \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,\" the second sequel to 's Wizarding World franchise mirrors the first, which is to say that it feels like an extended prologue for a better movie that's yet to materialize. In hindsight, Rowling should have funneled her Harry Potter prequel into a limited series, where leisurely pacing is more the norm.In theory, a \"young Dumbledore\" movie would address some of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" shortcomings, providing a more dynamic anchor than the shy and halting Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). Moreover, Rowling has added more A-list help this time around, teaming not only with director David Yates but co-writer Steve Kloves, another veteran of the Harry Potter franchise.Still, the storyline essentially handcuffs Dumbledore (Jude Law), or at least ties his wand behind his back for too much of the movie, by virtue of his romantic bond with the evil Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen, ably stepping in for ), who -- in classic authoritarian fashion -- intends to take over the magical world and wage war against Muggles. (The references to their past relationship are relatively chaste, but were apparently still .)Because Dumbledore can't directly confront Grindelwald and his minions, he must recruit not only Newt but an eclectic group of wizards and witches, as well as Newt's Muggle pal Jacob (Dan Fogler). But other than Jessica Williams' enhanced role as Eulalie (Lally) Hicks (sporting a '40s gangster accent that takes some getting used to), they're a fairly nondescript bunch.Foremost, the latest \"Fantastic Beasts\" unfolds with no great sense of urgency, sending the gang on a series of adventures and detours building toward an anticipated showdown to thwart Grindelwald's plans.Having played villains in James Bond, Marvel and now Harry Potter movies, Mikkelsen advances his bad-guy Hall of Fame credentials, and when he sneers, \"With or without you, I'll burn down their world,\" he introduces a sense of menace that outshines most everything else in the film.Yet even with that contribution and the characteristically impressive production design and effects, \"Fantastic Beasts\" seldom sparks to life. In hindsight, the real misstep might have come when Warner Bros. (like CNN, part of Warner Bros. Discovery) let Rowling outline , as opposed to at most a more conventional trilogy, although  the fourth and fifth installments could depend on how well \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" performs at the box office.Whatever the commercial verdict, the creative one delivers another mixed bag that tempers enthusiasm for more, barring promises to both pick up the pace and enhance Law's role in a more definitive manner.Otherwise, like  \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" is handsomely done but ultimately too much of a dumble-snore. And somehow, its appealing pieces, old and new, again add up to a less-than-magical movie. ",

Along with crocuses and daffodils, fluffy bunnies and chicks and pastel colors popping up everywhere, spring is the season when the sunny spheres of eggs take center stage.While you might be getting your fill of the chocolate egg variety this month -- I'll take mine filled with coconut, thanks -- April is also the time to celebrate the versatility of fresh eggs.Eggs are a nutrient-dense food and \"a perfect way to jump-start your day,\" according to Lisa Steele, fifth-generation chicken keeper, self-described eggs-pert and author of \".\"\"They fill you up, they have some fat in them, they're a complete protein, and they're so versatile,\" she said. One egg contains 6 grams of protein and a host of crucial nutrients such as vitamin B12, riboflavin, choline, biotin and selenium.There's no need to groan at the thought of using up a baker's dozen of hard-boiled eggs after Easter for those who celebrate either. In fact, you don't need to hard-boil eggs before dyeing them. This might not be ideal for anyone hiding eggs for an Easter egg hunt. But for general use, dyed eggs work just as well as au naturel eggs in the following recipes and dishes.No serious examination of this ingredient's versatility can begin without an appreciation of the egg breakfast sandwich. Whether it's on a bagel, crusty roll, English muffin, biscuit or tortilla, a simple scrambled or fried egg is a classic kick-starter for many a morning.But there's more to do with an egg beyond the skillet, and it's OK to take it beyond breakfast, too. Give yourself carte blanche to eat your favorite egg-centric dishes any time of day.For fans of runny yolks,  or muffin tins are much more hands-off than making multiple poached eggs for the family. The basic template is simple: Fill the dish or tin with a combination of meat, vegetables or cheese, then crack in an egg and season with spices and herbs. Bake until the whites are set and the yolks have a bit of jiggle to them.For those who prefer a more scrambled egg, the savory tart and quiche family is where it's at -- with a bonus of baking them in a flaky edible container. Technically, the difference between a tart and a quiche is a matter of depth: Tarts are baked in shallow pans, while quiches are of the deep-dish variety.But whichever you choose, a quiche or a tart is an ideal opportunity to make the most of what's in your fridge. Again, pick a combination of meats, vegetables and cheeses and use an egg custard blended with cream or milk to hold it all together. Try a or a to get started.Love to bake? Now's the time to try your hand at making an egg-enriched bread. French , Jewish , Swiss , Italian  -- many cultures have their own version of a sweet, and often braided, bread. Dairy such as milk or butter is also frequently added to these doughs, making them pull-apart tender.To double your eggy pleasure, slice or cube the bread, and let it sit for a day to go slightly stale. Then turn it into  or a decadent casserole.\"I almost feel like the egg yolk and the egg white are two separate foods,\" Steele said. With different flavors and textures, the yolk and white can be used separately to add richness and structure to a variety of dishes.(From a nutritional perspective, the egg white is mostly all protein, while the yolk contains the essential nutrients, so it's ideal to eat both in some form.)It's easier to separate yolks from whites when eggs are cold, and the simplest way is to do it with your hands. Crack the egg into a bowl, then scoop out the yolk and let the excess whites run through your fingers.For this writer, the most perfect and convenient use of an egg yolk is in .

        "content": "Home prices have  that many homeowners have decided to stay put and make their own home better. But even if you're renovating a home to live in it, it's still important to know what you can expect to recoup from those upgrades and improvements and what will eventually pay off when it comes time to sell. Homeowners that over-renovate a home may not get the cost of the improvement back.For example, it's not the spa-like bathroom or the magazine-worthy custom kitchen that provide the best return on investment, according to a new report on the impact of home remodeling from the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. Instead, the interior projects that recoup the most are refinishing hardwood floors and installing new hardwood flooring.The report estimates the cost of refinishing floors at $3,400 with an estimated return on investment of $5,000, for a 147% recovery of costs. The estimated cost of installing hardwood floors is higher at $5,000, but with a $6,500 return on investment, 118% of the cost is recovered, according to the research. Meanwhile, the cost of a dream project -- like the addition of a new primary bedroom suite -- can be an estimated $182,000, with only about $100,000 of that cost recovered, making the return on investment the lowest of the projects evaluated at 56%.After refinishing floors and new hardwood, the next best return on investmentwas another decidedly unsexy project: an insulation upgrade. Priced at an estimated $2,500, all of that cost is expected to be recovered for a 100% return.Homeowners who do complete kitchen and bath renovations can expect to recoup around 75% of those costs, according to the report. With an estimated cost of about $80,000, a total kitchen renovation recoups about $60,000,and homeowners can expect to recover about $25,000 of a $35,000 bathroom renovation, about 71% of the project's cost.Renovating a basement into a living space offers a bit better rate of a return. At an estimated cost of $57,500, homeowners can recoup 86% of that project's cost. As for exterior home improvements, the projects with the best return on investment are replacing the roof and the garage doors, with both recouping all their costs.Homeowners can expect to get back about 86% of the costs of installing vinyl siding and 67% of vinyl windows, but only 63% of wood windows. The actual cost of each remodeling project and cost recovery are influenced by many factors, including project design, quality of materials, location, age and condition of the home, and homeowner preferences.\"Quite often, an added benefit to home renovations is the possibility of an increase in the home's value, which is a reason why some people remodel,\" said Lautz. \"This is especially advantageous to a homeowner who may be considering selling their house or converting the home to a rental property.\"While the pandemic put much of the economy on pause, residential renovations boomed as homeowners reconfigured their home for new uses like work and school, even as the cost of materials and labor rose.Americans spent $420 billion in 2020 on remodeling their homes and nearly all NARI members found a greater demand in contracting in remodeling work that year.Of homeowners surveyed, 35% hired professionals for the entire job, 28% hired the labor but purchased the materials, and 22% did the entire project themselves. \"Homeowners tend to undertake a remodeling project for any number of reasons,\" said Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at NAR. \"In some instances, homeowners were content with sprucing up a room with a simple paint job, while in other cases, families decided to take on the task of renovating an entire attic or basement to add additional living space to their home.\"About 35% of those surveyed said the most important result from their remodel was better functionality and livability. Around 22% said they had durable and long-lasting results, materials and appliances, and 14% reported beauty and aesthetics as a result of their remodel.\"The pandemic has changed the way we use our homes, and many of those changes are here to stay,\" said Lautz. \"As a result, homeowners needed to reconfigure or remodel how they use their home and maximize space.\"",

        "content": "They may be the most famous international superstars you have never heard of, thanks to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis trying to eliminate their very existence.But in the musical \"Harmony,\" which premiered in New York this week, Barry Manilow and his longtime songwriting partner Bruce Sussman are trying to give the six young men of the Comedian Harmonists their rightful place in history by telling their story.It is a project they have been working on for decades, but \"Harmony's\" relevance now is chilling, with war raging in Ukraine and innocent lives being disrupted by hate.\"It sounds very current,\" Manilow said in an interview during a rehearsal last month.\"I think one of the many joys about doing this show now is that it seems to be resonating more than ever,\" Sussman added.\"There are actually moments in the show where I fear that people are going to think I'm writing to the headlines. These things were written, some of them years ago, and it's just now that they seem like they're taken from the front page of the paper or your lead story on CNN,\" he said.Three of the Comedian Harmonists were Jewish, three were gentile. They were shut down by Hitler, their 12 films and many records ordered burned and destroyed. All men scattered and fled, and one of their Jewish wives was taken by the Third Reich and never seen again.But before it got to that, the men, worldwide sensations in the early 1930s, were in New York, playing Carnegie Hall, and had the opportunity to stay in America but decided to return to Germany.The poignancy of these men not being able to imagine a dictator like Hitler could kill innocent people the way he did is a bone chilling parallel to current events, as Vladimir Putin appears to target civilians - children and women - in his own bloodthirsty quest for land and power.When the character known as \"Rabbi,\" played by Chip Zien, belts out a painful line \"Why?\" the audience does not have to be transported back almost a century to connect with the wanton evil. It is happening as we speak in Ukraine.\"It's the same hate, just different uniforms,\" is one of many lines in the musical with that tragically timely meaning.The group was officially shut down by the Nazis not only because some of the members were Jewish, but because the singers were labeled \"degenerate\" and censored, also the kind of tactic one sees today in Putin's Russia.Sussman wrote the lyrics, and Manilow wrote the music. \"It's my proudest moment as a songwriter,\" said Manilow.\"This is what I started off wanting to be. I wanted to be a Broadway songwriter and an arranger of pop music. That was it. And here it is. It's taken a little while longer, a little longer than I thought it would, but this is the kind of Broadway musical that I always wanted to write. It's got every style of music that I have always loved. It's not just one style. You would think, 'Oh, Barry Manilow, it's going to be all ballads.' It's not. Every song is totally different than the one before it,\" Manilow elaborated.\"This is the Barry I want everybody to know about,\" Sussman chimed in.The two have been collaborators for 50 years, writing one of Manilow's most enduring hits together: \"Copacabana.\" \"'Copacabana' was an ice cream sundae. It was frothy, and it was fun to do, and it was stylistic, stylish. It was also a very weird pop song because there was nothing like it on the radio. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it was as successful as it was. This is -- we have to put ourselves into the head of 1920s, 1930s Germany between the wars,\" explained Sussman.\"We talk about the depth of this piece. It's not a serious evening. The first act is as up, and happy, and funny, and full of energy as any Broadway musical that I've ever seen. Just on the second act, it starts to go dark,\" said Manilow. The idea came decades ago after Sussman watched a documentary about the Comedian Harmonists and called Manilow to say he found the musical they should write. Before Manilow became a pop star in the early 1970s with his first hit, \"Mandy,\" the collaborators and friends wanted to be the next Rodgers and Hammerstein. Both native New Yorkers and Jewish, they said they connected with this story immediately.\"We know these people. I mean, there are Jewish characters and gentile characters. We certainly know the Jewish characters. These are people we grew up with. These are people in our family. These were people in our neighborhoods who happened to also be terrifically talented,\" said Sussman.\"We know what means stuff to them. Yeah, it was deep. That part was a deep experience. Bruce had to go way deeper than I did since he's the book writer, the story writer. But I had to do my own work and find melodies that made sense in this world of Germany and Jewish,\" Manilow said.And to those Manilow melodies, the characters sing of impending doom the audience knows is coming: ",

Going into the quarterfinal match at the Camp Nou level at 1-1 after the first-leg, Frankfurt at one point found themselves three goals up on the night.Filip Kostić's brace and Rafael Borré's fine strike put the German side in surprise control and it looked to be coasting to a memorable win until a frantic end to the match. Barça scored twice in added time, through a magnificent Sergio Busquets goal and a last-second penalty from Memphis Depay, but the Catalan club ran out of time to stage what would have been an astonishing comeback. The result was celebrated by the thousands of Frankfurt faithful who managed to find their way into the stadium. Only 5,000 tickets were officially allocated to the away team, but there seemed to be many more inside the iconic arena with Spanish press reporting at least 20,000 were able to attend the match. Barcelona president Joan Laporta said he was \"ashamed\" that so many Frankfurt fans managed to get in. \"It is a shame we have experienced this here today. It cannot happen again. We have a lot of information about what has happened and we need time to go over it,\" he told Barça TV.  \"Then we will take measures, we will explain them and it will not happen again ever because it is an outrage.\"It was all looking so good for the . The Catalan club looked to have turned a corner after a difficult start to the season and was enjoying a 15-match unbeaten run. But the La Liga outfit struggled to cope with Frankfurt's lightning-quick counter attacks and will learn a lot from a match which highlighted areas that need quick improvement. Barça manager Xavi, also frustrated by the number of away fans in the stadium, said his team didn't play well enough across the two legs. \"We were trying for some heroics at the end, but it wasn't enough. We didn't play the best way,\" he told reporters. \"In fact, we weren't good tonight. They played well on the counterattack and although their second was a fantastic goal, it stemmed from a very silly mistake of ours.\"Frankfurt, currently ninth in the Bundesliga, will now play West Ham in the semifinals after the Hammers reached the last four of a European competition for the first time in 46 years.

        "content": "The world has a lot of problems. Big problems, with big consequences that require big solutions. In the midst of all this \"bigness,\" the average person can end up feeling too small to offer anything of value. They can forget that, sometimes, the path to somewhere better starts small. It can start with a single arm of groceries, driven down the road, so a neighbor can have a meal. No one has to wait for permission, no one has to worry whether their efforts are worthy. They can just do it. That's the philosophy behind community fridges, a growing movement of mutual aid that supports neighborhoods in need while tackling food waste and turning a keen eye to the larger causes of food insecurity. In 2020, Latisha Springer was feeling, well, like most people felt that year. \"It was a difficult summer. It was really negative and overwhelming, and I was tired of thinking about how messed up everything was. I wanted to do something,\" she tells CNN.Springer had learned about community fridges while living abroad in Europe. The practice first took hold : A refrigerator, stocked with food by community members, for anyone to use at any time regardless of need or economic status.\"I thought it was a cool concept -- eliminate the middleman; direct, open access.\"Then she thought some more. Why not here, in Atlanta? Why not now? It all came together quickly, Springer says. Though no one would call this kind of work easy, exactly, resources were simpler to obtain and people were more interested in contributing than Springer thought they would be. She created an Instagram account and posted some requests. A local business offered to host her first fridge, and then provide her some working space. Two years later, , supported by a web of contributing businesses and hundreds of volunteers. Springer quit her job and now puts her Master's Degree in Business to use coordinating several daily wellness checks and food drops, arranging donations from suppliers, and organizing other community activities like neighborhood clean-ups. Keeping up with volunteer scheduling and maintaining stocks and transportation is constant work, but Springer says she knows she can always rely on the people around her. \"Our community is amazing,\" she says. \"Whenever we need something, there's always someone who knows someone who can get it done.\" The concept of community fridges in the US caught on as need that had always been present became more visible during the early months of the pandemic. That's when Eric von Haynes, an organizer and artist in Chicago, began working on a community fridge program with local mutual aid groups. , supported, in part, by grant money and the efforts of Love Fridge volunteers and other local aid coalitions. \"When we began, I wanted to make sure this was sustainable,\" Von Haynes tells CNN. \"Food scarcity didn't start with the pandemic and it isn't going to end when the pandemic ends. We want to make sure we create relationships that last.\" Food is provided by community members, restaurants, local chefs, urban farmers, grocers and food pantries. The Love Fridge, like many community fridges, also offers several other resources like domestic violence support and veterinary care through another mutual aid group. (Community fridges often act as hubs for approved non-food donations like hand warmers for winter months, or baby supplies.)Free99 Fridge and The Love Fridge are good examples of how the same seed, once planted, can grow in different ways. Springer grew Atlanta's Free99 fridges through social media and word-of-mouth, with no background in this kind of work. Already a figure in the fertile mutual aid landscape of Chicago, Von Haynes began a new program that immediately intertwined with related programs. Both have flourished.Mutual aid, which community fridges exemplify, differs from charity because there is no decision on who gets what and why. These programs tend to be run on a \"by the people, for the people\" mindset and prioritize boots-on-the-ground volunteering over donations -- though both help. Mutual aid also allows for people to communicate what they need, rather than being told by contributing parties. Understanding the potential of something like this, like a refrigerator anyone can contribute to or take from, requires a lot of unlearning. \"I had a lot of pushback when I got started like, 'Who's going to monitor who's taking too much?'\" Springer says. \"But what's 'too much?' How do we know what people need, what they are using it for?\" She says her \"fridge friends\" -- those who use Free99 locations -- often tell her they're helping out neighbors in need, or making sure their family members are taken care of. Other questions abound, asked with skepticism or concern: Who looks after the fridge? (Volunteers, who perform wellness checks and maintenance.) What about sanitation? (Volunteers, again. Plus, organizers try to make sure their fridges are on private property to avoid municipal conflicts.) What if someone puts something bad in there? (Fridges are checked regularly, and Von Haynes says community fridges are protected by the Emerson Act, .)There are rules, of course, for the kinds of things community fridges accept. The bottom line? Don't put in what you wouldn't take out.Von Haynes says people are sometimes surprised to learn that grocery partners often contribute expensive food like premium iced coffee, milk alternatives or nice chocolates, as if people who need food deserve the bare minimum and nothing more. \"That comes down to the way that people have been programmed,\" Von Haynes says. The reality is, community fridges help reduce food waste (another \"mutual\" benefit in mutual aid). Not everything that approaches its expiration date is bad; it's just less likely to sell. Plus, retailers and restaurants often have a surplus of perfectly good food that, for one reason or another, can't be sold.  food waste makes up 30% to 40% of the country's food supply. That means food scarcity often hinges on what people can afford and access, rather than the supply that's actually available. Community fridges help break down that barrier, whether it's with an apple or a $9 bottle of cold brew. That prospect can be uncomfortable -- separating availability from value, and value from cost. It can inspire defensiveness, a reflexive retreat into the belief that, because things are the way they are, it is the way they should be. \"While we do want these fridges to serve those in need, we want to change that idea culturally. It's important that we move away from the idea that every action is need-based,\" Von Haynes says. \"We offer resources without gatekeeping.\"\"Food is a human right,\" he continues. \"And people deserve good food.\" Community fridges may start as something small and singular, but even from the beginning, they are rooted to larger systems of social justice and activism. \"You can't talk about food insecurity without talking about poverty, unemployment, housing and healthcare,\" Springer says. Mutual aid programs and issues of racial justice are deeply interwined, dating back to the Black Panther Party's Free , which is said to have been used as a template for the USDA's school breakfast program. Community fridges are often decorated by local artists, splashed with bright messages of nonviolence and solidarity. In Atlanta, each of Free99's fridges is named after a Black community member who was killed by police or in police custody: Breonna (Taylor), Sandra (Bland), Elijah (McClain), Tamir (Rice). In Chicago, The Love Fridge's locations and work intersect with abolitionist groups and important locations around the city where community action is already happening. Springer says making relationships with the people who use the fridges is the most powerful part. It's disgusting the way unhoused people, people in need are treated. These are our neighbors, and it's like people don't want to acknowledge they exist.\" she says. \"So our friends are grateful for the food, but they're also grateful for not being invisible.\"\"I think people are realizing that, ultimately, the only way we can make it is to rely on each other,\" she continues. \"This is how we should treat each other and this is the humanity with which we should operate.\"In caring hands, with the roots of a whole community running underneath, a single fridge can become a network of them. And together, they can become something more.It takes work, yes. It takes time. But Springer and Von Haynes are showing it's possible. ",

I want to thank Dr. Graham and the incredible staff and The Kettering Medical Center in Ohio.\" DeChambeau has had an injury-plagued start to 2022, having finished 2021 ranked No. 5 in the world. The 28-year-old admitted ahead of the Masters earlier this month that he has been dealing with a hand and hip injuries which have affected his play. He explained that he's been dealing with a torn left hip labrum for around two years and injured his hand -- also reaggravating his hip -- when he slipped over on a marble floor while playing table tennis at the  in February. \"That's really when it just got to the point where I couldn't even grip the golf club,\" he said in a press conference ahead of the Masters. \"I tried to play that week, and it was impossible. I was not even gripping with my left hand that week. I was like, 'This is dumb, I have to go take care of my body first and get it right.'\"That's what happened. And went and got a CT scan, MRI, and we found out that -- and X-rays in my left hip, was kind of -- I had a torn labrum, a partial tear. And then in the hand, I had a hairline fracture in the hamate bone, which a lot of baseball players get from excessive hitting.\" DeChambeau took a six-week break to attempt to let the injuries heal but was clearly hampered at Augusta National, missing the cut by eight shots after an opening round four-over 76 followed by a eight-over 80 in the second round. He has seen his world ranking slip to 19th and said he hopes to be back competing at the \"golf's highest level\" after taking the \"appropriate time needed to rest and recover.\"\"Over the past few months My Team, Dr. Graham, and myself have been monitoring the fracture to the hamate bone in my left wrist,\" he said. \"I made attempts to play through this injury at three recent events, including the Masters, but this is typically an injury that requires surgical treatment.\"Through continued discomfort from the fracture, it has caused me to alter my grip and swing, resulting in my inability to compete at golf's highest level. This has not been easy physically and mentally for me.\"For now, I will be taking the appropriate time needed to rest and recover from this procedure and look forward to competing at the highest level within the next two months. Thank you to my family, team, partners, and supporters during this tough stretch but I am excited to work hard to get back competing soon.\"",

        "content": "Native American people in Maine have been excluded from protections guaranteed by federal law for more than 40 years but lawmakers could help change it.As the state Legislature's second session reaches its final days, a  to restore  to Maine's tribes is being considered. Earlier this week, dozens of Indigenous advocates, social justice groups and environmentalists marched outside the state capitol building.The bill, , aims to give the , the , the  and the  (formerly known as the Aroostook Band of Micmacs) power to regulate hunting, fishing, natural resources, land use on tribal lands, economic development, among other rights.The state House voted 81-55 to pass the bill on Thursday and now it heads to the Senate. The legislature is scheduled to adjourn its session on Wednesday.Leaders of the Wabanaki nations said they haven't had equal access to many federal programs and have been excluded from new policy involving federally recognized tribesas a result of a decades-old settlement.In the 1970s a years-long legal battle ensued when the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy argued their ancestral lands had been unlawfully relinquished to Massachusetts and then Maine without the approval of the federal government as required by the Nonintercourse Act of 1790. Their claim was considered to cover about two thirds of Maine's land.The dispute was eventually settled in 1980 with the signage of the , which led the federal government to pay $81.5 million to the tribes but made them subject to Maine laws and placed them under the jurisdiction of state courts.\"What was meant to settle a land claim turned into all kinds of jurisdictional provisions,\" Chief Kirk Francis of the Penobscot Nation told CNN.Since the settlement was reached, Francis says, Congress has passed  \"for the benefit of Native Americans that tribes in Maine have not been able to access in a way that other tribes do across the country.\"Those federal laws include the , which amended the Stafford Act to provide federally recognized tribal governments the option to request a major disaster declaration; and the , which includes a provision allowing tribes to employ medical professionals licensed in another state.Francis said the settlement has impacted the daily lives of the Penobscot people in other ways. For example, the tribe currently doesn't have decision power over dam relicensing and wastewater discharge from municipalities and businesses that affect tribal waters, he said.\"It's been very difficult culturally for the tribe over the years to not have a voice,\" said Francis, adding the Penobscot are riverine people, which means the river and its resources are central to their culture.State Rep. Rachel Talbot Ross, the bill's sponsor, has said it's \"absolutely past time\" to restore tribal sovereignty in Maine and \"modernize\" the relationship between the state and the Wabanaki nations.\"Every time a study is conducted on how the tribes fare under the Settlement Act, it's critical conclusion is that the tribes suffer and have been unable to progress at the same rate as most of other tribal nations within this country,\" Talbot Ross said in on the bill in February.While tribal leaders are hopeful state lawmakers may approve the proposed bill during the current session, they have recently faced both support and opposition for legislative changes.Last year, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, vetoed a bill to allow tribal gaming. In her , the governor said the tribes have been \"unfairly excluded\" from operating their own gaming facility, but the bills were not the answer to a complex issue.Jerry Reid, the chief legal counsel to Gov. Mills, testified against L.D. 1626 in a February hearing saying the governor's office was not ready to support the bill as drafted.He said the governor is not \"necessarily opposed to amending\" the settlement act but \"when amendments are being considered, it's critical that we avoid ambiguous language that could lead to future conflict or litigation.\"Spokespeople for Mills did not respond to requests of comment about L.D. 1626, the proposed tribal sovereignty bill.During a House vote on Thursday, state Rep. Lauren Libby criticized the bill saying it could result in conflicting regulations at the state, federal and tribal levels that could lead to years of costly litigation. Numerous Maine communities may likely be impacted by those disputes because unlike other states, Libby said, tribal land is spread throughout the state and not continuous. For Francis, the opposition to the bill is out of \"fear of the unknown and quite frankly, the lack of wanting to give up any control.\" \"This is not the tribes trying to gain any special rights here. We're just in to restore the rights we had,\" he said.In Congress, US Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, recently introduced  that would amend the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 and allow future federal laws to impact the Wabanaki nations. The bill has been referred to the House natural resources subcommittee.\"This bill will cut through unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic efforts to block the Wabanaki tribes from benefiting from future federal laws passed for their benefit, and create opportunities for improved standards of living and economic growth,\" Golden said in a over the bill last month.CNN's Tiffany Anthony contributed to this report.",

        "content": ".The host of the Passover seder I'll attend Friday evening will include an orange on the ceremonial plate, as a means of acknowledging gay and lesbian struggles during the holiday that commemorates Jewish people's liberation from bondage in Egypt.The orange is a relatively recent addition to the seder plate. Susannah Heschel, a Jewish studies professor at Dartmouth College and the daughter of the civil rights leader Abraham Joshua Heschel, added the piece of fruit in the early 1980s.\"During the first part of the seder, I asked everyone to take a segment of the orange, make the blessing over fruit, and eat it as a gesture of solidarity with Jewish lesbians and gay men, and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community,\" . \"In addition, each orange segment had a few seeds that had to be spit out -- a gesture of spitting out, repudiating the homophobia that poisons too many Jews.\"The inclusion of the orange, which some use to represent feminism, shines a light on a wider pattern: Over the course of decades, many celebrants have used Passover to signal their support for a variety of freedom struggles -- to ask and answer questions about the world around them and the role they want to play in it.For instance, in April 1969, some 800 people -- Jewish, Christian, Black, White -- joined together in the basement of Lincoln Temple, a Black church in Washington, . The event marked the one year that had passed since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and also underscored Black-Jewish kinship bonds.Still curious about the evolution of Passover, I spoke with Rabbi Sandra Lawson, the director of racial diversity, equity and inclusion at Reconstructing Judaism, and Emily Tamkin, a senior editor at The New Statesman and the author of the forthcoming \"\" (and the host of the seder I'll attend on Friday).Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. There are many people who think that there's a right way to observe any Jewish anything. But the beautiful thing about Judaism is that it's constantly evolving. That's how we survive.Passover, I believe, is probably the most celebrated Jewish holiday because it takes place in the home, where people can infuse their customs, their food, as long as it subscribes to the rules of the holiday. But different customs have interpreted those rules to mean different things. I just wrote a whole book that basically says that there's no one correct way to be Jewish, so it would be the height of hypocrisy for me to go out and say, \"This is how you have to celebrate Passover.\" What I really love about this particular holiday, aside from the story itself, is that, if you want it to be, it's in conversation with the world around you -- because it's a story about overcoming oppression and about freedom and about searching for something better and about solidarity.There's so much there that you can use to explore not only Jewish history but present politics, if you so choose. And I think that if you look back at the last several decades of Jewish American history, you see people doing that. They're bringing older traditions in conversation with their country and with the world and creating new traditions in the process. I told my wife about the 10-minute seder (at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, some of Lawson's students at Elon University, where she previously served as the Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life, created an abbreviated seder so that they could celebrate before leaving campus). We're going to make matzo. We're going to do the 10-minute seder. And we're going to hang out.Like a lot of people, I've had to rethink my own orthodoxy around the holiday. If you had told me three years ago that I would actually be in a plague during a time when we're studying the plague and that I wouldn't be doing the things I normally do on Passover, I would've thought that you were nuts. But the world changed. Making matzo (unleavened bread)has become one of our traditions.There are people who are going to be upset and say, \"You can't make your own matzo.\" I can. That's a beautiful thing about this holiday. It's celebrated in the home, and people have the freedom to observe the holiday however they want to.There are people who say that you can't do stuff. People say that to me because . They say things like, \"You can't be a rabbi if you're Black\" or \"You can't be a rabbi if you're queer\" or \"You can't be a rabbi if you're a woman.\" I am so glad that this year we are hopefully able to celebrate together indoors. The word in Yiddish class that we use for \"pandemic\" is the same word that we use for \"plague.\" So it certainly takes on a new resonance that this is happening now.I also want to say that I celebrate Passover a bit differently now than I did when I was younger. As an adult hosting my own seders, I have an orange on my seder plates. One year, my husband and I used the  (the book or guide read during the seder), which has a prompt about refugees now to talk and think about while you're having your own seder.To me, this is a holiday about knowing who you are and not letting anybody take that away from you, and also extending that same right to everyone. The thing that makes my wife's and my seder plate different is that we have a vegan house. And early on, I was trying to figure out how to make a vegan seder plate and started doing some research. In place of an egg, we slice an avocado. And in place of the shank bone, a roasted beet. I also add an orange to my seder plate to remember and pay homage to the feminist movement.And I haven't done this yet, but I'm thinking about adding a tomato, which can represent farmworkers and highlight the lack of awareness and the lack of pay and the poor conditions for people who pick tomatoes. I'll have an orange on my seder plate to represent solidarity with LGBTQ and other marginalized people. But I understand that some people include it to mean feminism or to mean LGBTQ solidarity  feminism. When preparing for this interview, I saw that some people have suggested that for interfaith families you can have an artichoke on your seder plate. Some people turn to an olive for peace in the Middle East or Palestinian solidarity. There are just so many different things that you can include.But what I want to stress is: More than whatever Haggadah you use, and more than whatever individual symbol you have on your seder plate, the important thing is that you're thinking about what the holiday means -- that you're thinking about what the story meant then and what it means in your own life now.I don't want to tell anybody how to live or be. But, to me, it's important not to get so hung up on any one song or piece of fruit that you lose sight of the fact that questioning and changing and doing things a little differently and deciding what to keep and what to shed are part of the Passover tradition, too.",

They should not be traded like commodities and transferred abroad for processing,\" UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Gillian Triggs said in a statement. \"UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum-seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,\" Triggs said. UNHCR also said that the plan would increase risks and cause refugees to look for alternative routes, putting more pressure on front line states. \"Experience shows that these agreements are eye-wateringly expensive usually. They often violate international law. They don't lead to solutions, rather to widespread detention or to more smuggling,\" UNHCR Senior legal officer Larry Bottinick told British radio station Times Radio on Thursday. Human Rights Watch was fiercely critical of the plan, issuing a strongly-worded .\"Rwanda's appalling human rights record is well documented,\" it said.\"Rwanda has a known track record of extrajudicial killings, suspicious deaths in custody, unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, and abusive prosecutions, particularly targeting critics and dissidents. In fact, the UK directly raised its concerns about respect for human rights with Rwanda, and grants asylum to Rwandans who have fled the country, including four just last year,\" it said, adding, \"At a time when the people of the UK have opened their hearts and homes to Ukrainians, the government is choosing to act with cruelty and rip up their obligations to others fleeing war and persecution.\"Amnesty International UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Director Steve Valdez-Symonds described the plan as \"shockingly ill-conceived.\" \"Sending people to another country -- let alone one with such a dismal human rights record -- for asylum 'processing' is the very height of irresponsibility and shows how far removed from humanity and reality the Government now is on asylum issues,\" Valdez-Symonds said in a . As part of the new plan, the British Royal Navy will take over operational command from Border Force in the English Channel \"with the aim that no boat makes it to the UK undetected,\" Johnson said. It also allows UK authorities to prosecute those who arrive illegally, \"with life sentences for anyone piloting the boats,\" he said. The English Channel, a narrow waterway between Britain and France, is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world's poorest or war-torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain.Last November,in bitterly cold waters off the coast of France after an inflatable boat carrying migrants bound for Britain capsized, in one of the deadliest incidents in the English Channel in recent years.CNN's Kara Fox and Helen Regan contributed to this report.

It's a complex olfactory chorus of odors that elicits an emotional response.At car companies like Nissan there are professionals part of whose job is to sniff carefully and ensure every new car has the that unique new car smell. So many demands are made on materials used inside of a car -- they have to last for years, must be easily cleanable, withstand extreme temperatures, and so on -- that expecting them to also smell nice is a lot to ask.But these difficult demands are why carmakers employ people like Tori Keerl, a materials engineer at Nissan's technical center in Farmington Hills, Michigan. She oversees a team of odor experts who carefully analyze the smells of everything that goes inside of vehicles like the Nissan Pathfinder SUV and Frontier pickup. I met her on the show floor of the New York Auto Show to talk about smells and to put my own nose to the test.Keerl was originally hired as a plastics materials engineer, but, partly because plastics make up the majority of materials inside of a non-luxury vehicle, she was soon given overall responsibility for the way Nissan vehicles smell inside. \"Every time we launch a vehicle, we have to test the odor of it,\" she said. As a new model is being developed, Keerl and her team sniff test individual vehicle parts, such as steering wheels, seat cushions and visors, before they are put into the vehicle to make sure they have a pleasant -- or at least inoffensive -- odor.\"Then we put them into the vehicle,\" she said. \"We sit in the vehicle and we make sure that, as we're sitting in the driver's seat and as you're sitting in the back seat, you're smelling that good new car smell.\"Smells in the front seat can be vastlydifferent from smells in the back seat, she said. In the front seat, there's a far greater range of materials near the nose. Besides leather or fabric seats, there are the plastics on the dashboard and whatever the center storage console is made from. There are also all the bonding materials, threads and adhesives that hold these things together. In the back seat, you're much more surrounded by just seat materials. There are seats in front of you, behind you and under you. Then there's the smell of the carpet material underfoot.Even though all the components in the car have, by that point, been pre-smelled before being installed in a prototype vehicle, there are still surprises. As with cooking, some smells that are just fine, or even very nice, on their own can come together to create a hellish funk. Or sometimes there was a smell that was somehow missed in all the earlier sniffing.Then, Keerl's team has to start investigating. She and the members of her team are all \"certified smellers.\" (There is a training and certification that involves carefully administered smell identification tests.) They begin their investigation in much the same you would try to find a weird odor in your own car. They methodically sniff every inch of the inside of the car until they narrow down where the offending smell is coming from. Once they narrow down the odd odor, they begin the process of teasing out exactly what material, or combination of materials, is causing it.Often, a surprising off-smell in the fully assembled vehicle is due to a supplier having changed some aspect of how a part is made. In that case, Keerl said she'll work with the supplier to find what has changed and see if the problem can be fixed.Because a person's sense of smell can change over time, even day to day, the professional smellers are regularly re-certified with blind smell tests. They are provided with unlabeled vials of different scents and asked to identify each one.I tried it myself and it was surprisingly difficult. Smelling an odor without seeing what it's coming from is a bit like seeing your child's first grade teacher in the supermarket checkout line. You know you've met this person before, but, without the normal context, you can't recall where or how. I opened my first vial and smelled something vaguely pleasant and rich. It smelled... earthy. When that word came to mind, I realized that I was smelling dirt. It was a can full of soil. The next vial smelled somehow woodsy. I failed to recognize that I was smelling pine shavings, but once Keerl told me, I felt a little foolish. Pine has to be one of the world's most recognizable smells, but without being able to see the wood in front of me, I couldn't quite place it.Because attitudes towards smells vary from one culture to another, Keerl's work is focused on cars intended for North American customers. Car buyers in Europe and Asia may not appreciate a smell we find perfectly appealing here. They might not like the \"new car smell\" Americans appreciate, preferring no smell at all.",

        "content": "I never met them. But on this night, two years since our last Seder, I realize I have missed them. I know that Rudolph and Clara Komerofsky came to this country from Romania in 1902, that they brought almost nothing with them but the candlesticks on the Seder table. I know their descendants -- their faces, anyway, if I struggle to remember their names. One turns her head and I almost mistake her for Arin, Rudolph and Clara's great-granddaughter, and one of my closest friends. But Arin is already at our side, about to introduce us all again.For more than 10 years my wife and I have joined Arin and her family at their Passover Seder. We have shared the table with Arin's parents, Jay and Linda Miller, her grandma Birdie, and dozens of cousins and in-laws and once-removeds. Through our twenties and thirties, we lapsed Catholics have become as accustomed to parsley and salt water, Maror and Charoset as to the incense and Easter ham of our own childhoods.  And through two years of pandemic separation, we have had to settle for our own version of that Passover prayer, So now -- vaccinated, boosted, tested -- we come again to recall the branches of the Komerofsky family, who's from California and who from Columbus, who drinks Manischewitz and who Diet Coke. We know the uncle most eager to tell a new joke and the one who will laugh loudest. I know that Arin's husband, Joe, and I will plot to out-maneuver each other for the last bite of lamb shank. I have come to recognize Rudolph and Clara from the photos in the family Haggadah, and from the stories their descendants tell: their 20th century story, their journey from Romania to the United States, and the ancient one too, the flight from Egypt.  I will never know these ancestors. But throughout the night, I try to imagine them, grateful as I am to them for these friends of ours. Every year on this night different from all other nights, with its questions and responses, I join their descendants in the ancient ritual of the evening meal. After our pandemic separation, I fear I may be a little out of practice. Arin and I met 15 years ago, teaching at an independent Catholic high school on Cleveland's east side. Our friendship took root in our mutual struggles as new teachers, our failures and small, celebrated triumphs. Neither of us -- Arin, a Jewish atheist, nor I, a Catholic agnostic -- ever felt comfortable with the masses, the crossings, the acts of adoration, all the trappings of institutional religion.  What we valued in our -- and each other's -- traditions was the act of gathering around a table, breaking bread and telling stories. That, at least, was a faith we could keep: It brought us to each other's tables again and again, brought Arin and Joe to our doorstep with plates of food when my father died, and us to the Millers' when Grandma Birdie died, at age 96.I don't remember when I first joined in her family's ritual. Or whether I already knew that the Haggadah -- the text recited at the Seder -- required that \"in every generation, it is incumbent on each person to consider him/herself as if s/he had come forth personally from Egypt.\" I certainly did not know how the Komerofsky family understood that traditional injunction, in our own time, in their own words. In the Komerofsky Haggadah (\"slightly rearranged and abridged\"), between the second and third cups of wine, we give thanks for the Komerofsky family. We recite the ancestors' names, Rudolph and Clara, the names of their children and their children's partners, a litany of proper nouns written into the family book for the generations. At my first Seder, the recitation of the Haggadah felt like a script for which I'd forgotten my lines. In those early days I mumbled the Hebrew words for fear of mispronouncing them. I felt I had no right to say \"Next year in Jerusalem,\" even in English. But I could speak the names. As clearly as I could see the photographs in the Haggadah -- here is the whole family gathered around a shuffleboard court in a midcentury basement, here are Rudolph and Clara at their wedding in 1904 -- I could say their names. I could contribute to the embodiment of their memory in our own breath and voice.It was once strange, too, to encounter the ritual within the ritual, as Arin's father, Jay, reads the Haggadah and family members interrupt and interject. \"I thought we cut this part!\" an uncle shouts. \"Are you sure it was 1904?\" asks an aunt. Some of the jokes may be decades old; some of them make the room groan. But then Jay laughs his enormous laugh, and I cannot help laughing, too. This is what I have missed. This is not the rehearsed call and response of the Catholic mass where, at weddings and funerals at least, I still catch myself saying, \"And also with you.\" That cathedral hush is indeed one sort of religious experience.  But the moments when we laugh together -- as if the spirit were upon us, convulsed with joy until we cannot speak -- those must be holy, too. How well we know the Christ who suffered; how I long to know a Christ who laughed.I have heard or read or maybe imagined theologians who say that each of us writes our own gospel with our own life. I admire the idea. But none of my Catholic friends were ever encouraged to add our own words to the logos. One does not riff on the liturgy. Some of us still suspect that God speaks Latin. So it still seems both obvious and wondrous to me, the simple pure act of saying the names. To name, to utter is a holy act in any tradition, especially my adopted tradition as a writer.We say with them \"Max Komerofsky, Ann Abramson, Rose Sacks Mazur, Ethel Abrams, Sophie Goldsmith, Esther Brenner, Birdie Miller Joseph, Rivie Katz.\" I can believe in this, at least: the family -- all our families -- as the center of worship, celebration, consolation. Pious and doubter alike can say the names, keep close the memory or learn the story of the ancestors. We can try at least to live in such a way as to justify their lives and ours. For all I do not know, I have known at least that particular grace of being welcome. One year, when Aunt Rivie, the last of Rudolph and Clara's surviving children, asked me who I'd come with, I told her I was a friend of Arin's. \"Oh, good,\" she said, with what seemed genuine relief. \"You're all right then.\"In my life I've found that blessings, when they come, come this way. Not a laying on of hands but an offhand \"you're all right.\" The way an elder poet once said, when I dropped him off at his hotel after his reading, \"I think our paths may cross again.\" The way my father, when he told me he loved me, added the word \"kid.\"  \"Love you, kid.\" That gesture. A blessing is a sacrifice. Even the lapsed Catholic in me can grasp that.  -- from the Old English -- has to do with shed blood. From the lamb's blood that marks the doorway in Exodus to the open door in this Cleveland suburb where I join my friends in profane solemnity and reverend irreverence.\"Did the candles come from Romania, too?\" an uncle asked one year as Janet, our host, lighted them. \"No,\" Janet smiled.  \"I got them at Drug Mart.\"\"All of our relatives near and far,\" we say, \"and those of generations yet to be.\" I still cannot read the Hebrew, though I can pronounce a few more words and phrases now, enough to join in the speaking of the names, to say my own version of grace. The home the temple, the table the altar, the flame kept as one keeps a faith: day by day and in every generation. \"Next year in Jerusalem,\" I say with them now. I admire this moment of the ritual. But what I love is to trust that next year -- and for as many years as possible -- we will still be here together, far from Egypt and Romania and even Jerusalem, in this suburb on the east side of Cleveland.   It is the best I can hope for my own struggle with faith: the offhand blessing, given without asking. To arrive and to find the door is open. That we are welcome.",

        "content": "President Joe Biden on Friday announced his intent to nominate former Obama Treasury official Michael Barr as the vice chair for supervision of the , a move that would install a key architect of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 as the nation's top banking regulator.The announcement comes after Biden's initial nominee, Sarah Bloom Raskin,  in March, following opposition in the Senate based on her stance on climate change and fear that she could discourage banks from lending to fossil fuel companies. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined Republicans in opposing her, effectively torpedoing her nomination.In a statement Friday, Biden touted Barr, who is currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, for his \"strong support from across the political spectrum.\"Barr previously served in the Obama administration as assistant secretary for financial institutions under Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and was instrumental in designing Dodd-Frank, one of the most expansive pieces of consumer protection legislation to come out of the 2008 financial crisis. The banking rule also created the role of vice chair for supervision, the position for which Barr is nominated, as Biden noted in a statement released Friday.\"Barr has spent his career protecting consumers, and during his time at Treasury, played a critical role in creating both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the position for which I am nominating him. He was instrumental in the passage of Dodd-Frank, to ensure a future financial crisis would not create devastating economic hardship for working families,\" Biden said.Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial makeup. Several nominees to the Fed's Board of Governors, including Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed chair and Lael Brainard as vice chair, still await a vote from the Senate Banking Committee later this month. Economists Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook — who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board — also await Senate approval.Republicans already signaled they may put up a fight on Barr's nomination. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee,  that Barr \"defended Dodd Frank's big-bank bailout mechanism, which enshrined into law taxpayer bailouts of banks. He was also the primary author of the unconstitutional and unaccountable CFPB.\"One other potential point of contention could be Barr's close associations in the fintech world, including a brief stint on the board of Ripple, a cryptocurrency firm that has since come under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Barr's nomination comes at a crucial point for the Fed as it aims to engineer a soft landing for the economy amid the highest inflation in 40 years. Last month the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 as part of a series of moves to tighten the \"easy money\" policy that supported the economy during the worst of the Covid pandemic, and has indicated that it is ready to ramp up rates at a faster pace.",

        "content": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken told European allies that the United States believes  could last through the end of 2022, two European officials told CNN, as US and European officials have increasingly assessed that there is no short-term end in sight to the conflict.Many of the officials who spoke with CNN stressed that it is hard to predict exactly how long the war could go on, but several officials said that there are no indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ultimate goals have changed, and it is unlikely he will pursue diplomatic negotiations unless faced with military defeat. The thinking that this could be a long-term conflict represents a marked shift from the early days of the war, when Russia was expected to quickly take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, and underscores Moscow's failures on the battlefield.The longer the war goes on, the more brutal the humanitarian toll on the people of Ukraine. And while officials stressed there is likely to be continued international resolve to provide high levels of support to Ukraine, they acknowledged there may be very real practical challenges regarding weaponry that will need to be dealt with as the war wages on.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday that the fighting in Ukraine is likely to be \"protracted,\" and will go on \"for months or even longer.\"Some members of Congress and their aides are quietly making comparison to the Korean War, which lasted for three years. Two other European officials said they believe that fighting in eastern Ukraine -- where Russian forces are  -- could last for four to six months and then result in a stalemate.Blinken, a senior State Department official said, \"has discussed with his counterparts our concern that the conflict could be protracted, but all of his engagements have revolved around how best to bring it to a halt as quickly as possible.\"British Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said this week that the launch of the new Russian fighting in the Donbas could be weeks away, telling reporters that \"there is a window of opportunity and I think this is why the nature of our support is so important, that we are providing weapons, the equipment that Ukrainians need to do the job they need to do.\"There is growing public acknowledgment of the ties between Ukraine's success on the battlefield and any hope of a diplomatic resolution to the conflict -- a notion that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba addressed outright at last week's NATO Foreign Ministerial. \"It is clear that the positions of delegations in talks will be defined by the successes of relevant armies and the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia,\" he said. US officials cast the additional military support to Ukraine this week as a continuation, but do say that part of what has prompted the doubling down -- and additional support -- is the Ukrainians' battlefield efforts. A second senior State Department official said that \"we have done a lot and so we do have faith and we always had faith in our Ukrainian partners. But as the fight doubles down, so does our commitment to give them weapons and equipment that they can use,\" adding that the Ukrainians have used certain weapons systems \"to great effect.\" Blinken, in a statement Thursday about the new , said the US is \"focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible negotiating position by continuing to provide security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself and by increasing pressure on Putin by imposing severe costs on Russia.\" \"We think that (the Russians) really have the motivation only when they understand that they are facing a strategic defeat,\" Estonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN. \"As long as it's seeming they still have the same objectives in mind that they had in the beginning of the war, which is basically destroying the Ukrainian state and to have a complete surrender by Ukrainians, it's difficult to see them really being becoming serious about negotiations.\"Prikk said there are discussions underway about how to better coordinate security aid so that Ukraine has the weapons it needs at the moment it needs them, and noted that there are \"practical challenges\" regarding availability of weaponry. Such challenges were raised by other European officials who spoke with CNN, and State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday \"there are practical challenges that come with this, supply chain supplies, other elements of it.\"\"Those are things that we are working through,\" he said at a State Department briefing. The Pentagon this week hosted the CEOs of the military's eight largest contractors to discuss more rapid arms production. Officials also acknowledge that the public may grow weary for continued support for Ukraine, and will have to be reminded that inaction would be even more costly. \"You can't defend democracy for free. It just doesn't work like that,\" said Cleverly. \"The very visible cost is in human lives. We have discussed the number of people that have been killed and injured during this conflict, but it has a financial cost and you know -- we will be paying that through increased gas prices, we'll be paying that through general inflation as kind of the ripple effects of this kind of washes across the world, and people won't like that. And it's quite understandable that people won't like that, but they should also recognize that not acting would come at a much, much, much, much greater cost.\"There are also always risks that divisions in the transatlantic alliance could emerge the longer the war wages on, a European official said. However, they and others said that the atrocities Russia is committing in Ukraine are likely to play a role in keeping up international resolve in making sure Russia cannot win.\"I think the world has continued to be shocked by the level of atrocity, the level of violence, the level of brutality, that Russia's forces have engaged in against the Ukrainian people. I think that will necessarily maintain this level of consensus within the international community,\" Price said.\"There is no sense that these countries are preparing to move on, to look the other way, and in fact, every time we gather, there is renewed horror, there is renewed condemnation, there is renewed determination to continue to see to it that our Ukrainian partners have what they need,\" he said, adding, \"At a political level, at a strategic level, there's been no indication that we've seen that the focus, the determination, the perseverance will diminish over time.\"",

        "content": ", a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that blankets much of eastern Ukraine, has been the front line of the country's conflict with Russia since 2014.But now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are bracing for an assault even more intense. An  of the territory is expected to define Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, after his forces suffered costly failures in Kyiv, and across central and northern Ukraine.  Russian military convoys and resupplied units moving towards Donbas for a large-scale offensive, and Ukraine's foreign minister has warned the world of an impending battle there that will \"remind you of the Second World War.\" A Russian victory in the region would appall the West but could salvage Putin's war aims, while a defeat could cement his invasion as a historic failure. Either way, it is almost certain to devastate yet more of the Donbas region, a historically and culturally significant place whose proximity to Russia has dictated much of its turbulent existence.Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades.But the waves of conflict there since 2014 have reshaped and wounded its cities, and it is along its line of contact that both the Ukrainian and Russian military are most dug in -- making for a familiar but unpredictable new phase of war.Chimneys, factories and coal fields have dotted the landscape of Donbas for decades, and since its two major cities were founded -- Donetsk by a Welsh ironmaster in 1869, and Luhansk seven decades earlier by a Scottish industrialist -- industry has been the lifeblood of the region.The name Donbas is itself a portmanteau of the Donets Coal Basin, and throughout most of the 20th century it served an outsized role as the industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, pumping out coal in vast quantities. \"The Soviet Union intensively developed the Donbas as an industrial center,\" said Markian Dobczansky, an associate at Harvard University's Ukrainian Research Institute. \"It was a place that set the tempo of Soviet industrialization.\" It was a place, too, of \"extremely high-stakes industrial production, and repression,\" Dobczansky adds. \"Terror was present under Soviet rule. Repression happened all over the Soviet Union, but it happened intensely in the Donbas.\" Suspicion, arrests and show trials were rife.A rise in steel and metal manufacturing, the creation of a railroad and the development of a shipping industry in the port city of Mariupol diversified Donbas beyond its coal mining roots. But in the three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the region's economic might has shriveled. \"In the 1990s, the Donbas saw the floor drop out economically,\" Rory Finnin, associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge, told CNN.A decline in living standards and rampant poverty plagued the region during its initial transition from communism, Finnin said, and Donbas is now often likened to the Rust Belt regions of the United States, where once-thriving heartland locations have struggled to adapt. But an upturn in fortunes followed the turn of the century; Donbas remains Ukraine's industrial epicenter, complimenting the agricultural production of the rest of the country.While prosperity in the region has wavered, one steadfast characteristic of its inhabitants has not. The people of Donbas have and remain \"fiercely independent,\" Finnin said. \"It marches to the beat of its own drum.\"The region's long-standing industrial pull has attracted people from across Eastern Europe over the past century, and it has had strong social and economic ties to neighboring Russia as well as to the rest of Ukraine. Unlike much of central and western Ukraine, which had historically changed hands between various European empires, Donbas spent most of the past millennium under the control of Russia. In the country's only post-Soviet census in 2001, just over a half of the population of Donbas was made up of ethnic Ukrainians and a third of ethnic Russians. Russian is by some distance the most widely spoken language in Donbas, unlike in western Ukraine. But the country as a whole has a tradition of multilingualism and the connection between language and national identity is tenuous there, experts say.The cities of Donbas lie \"far away from the metropolitan centers, (and) far away from the big cities\" in central and western Ukraine, said Dobczansky. \"People could flee to the Donbas and get lost.\" Western-influenced, pro-European politics has typically not been embraced in Donbas as it has in the west of Ukraine.That sense of disconnect from the capital Kyiv and other metropolitan centers has given rise to a vast collection of local movements, and was the backdrop upon which pro-Russian separatists attempted to seize control following Moscow's annexation of Crimea.But Finnin and others warn \"it's important not to fall to notions that the Donbas is pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian,\" a concept that has been stirred up relentlessly by the Kremlin since 2014 but is roundly debunked by experts.In an exclusive CNN poll conducted by Savanta/ComRes shortly before Russia's invasion began, people in the easternmost region of Ukraine, which includes Donbas, mostly rejected the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are \"one people,\" and comprehensively disagreed that the two states should become one country. Fewer than one in five people there felt that way, compared to about a third of Russians who did, demonstrating the lack of desire to change national allegiance despite the region's longstanding cultural connections with Russia.\"(Pro-Russian) separatism prior to 2014 was a distinctly minority position,\" and no organized movement existed, Dobczansky said. Opinion polls -- and the region's own vote for independence in Ukraine's 1991 referendum -- affirmed Donbas' desire to leave Soviet-era allegiances behind. \"People would have a very strong sense of being a coal miner, or a metal worker, or being in the proletariat,\" he added. \"People (also) had a sense of being a part of the Ukrainian republic, but the idea was that the Donbas transcended national identities.\"Despite its move into independence along with the rest of Ukraine in 1991, Donbas has maintained a place in the psyche of Russian leadership.A famous Soviet propaganda  from 1921 dubbed Donbas \"the heart of Russia,\" depicting the region as a beating organ with vessels stretching across the Russian empire. Before then, the region was part of the concept of \"Novorossiya,\" or New Russia, a term given to territories towards the west of which the Russian empire had expansionist ideas. Cities like Luhansk and Donetsk are historically \"places that (Russians) could see a certain version of themselves,\" Finnin said. And that historical image could still persist inside Putin's own worldview, experts suggest.Observers have often suggested that Putin's desired endgame is to rebuild the Soviet Union in which he first rose up the ranks. Anna Makanju, former director for Russia at the US National Security Council, that Putin \"believes he is like the czars,\"the imperial dynasties that ruled Russia for centuries, \"potentially called by God in order to control and restore the glory of the Russian empire.\"But such a project could not be attempted without an effort to recapture Donbas, given its emotional resonance as the Russian empire's industrial backbone. \"It's symbolically very important; the Donbas supplied the entire Soviet Union with raw materials,\" Dobczansky said. It is in that context that Putin has refocused his stuttering invasion on the region where his conflict with Ukraine began eight years ago. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin has refocused his war strategy on achieving , Russia's \"Victory Day\" that marks the Nazi surrender in World War II. \"There's every possibility that Putin will move now to effectively bisect Ukraine; that will give him enough to be able to declare a victory domestically, and allay his critics that this has been a botched invasion,\" said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015.\"Taking the Donbas (would be) a consolation prize, because Kyiv is now out of Russia's military grasp, but it's a good consolation prize,\" Puri said.Putin's annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas by Russian-backed rebels in 2014 brought to a crashing halt a period of increasing prosperity in the region.War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.The  became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People's Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, temporarily Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics have not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria, and the Ukrainian government has steadfastly refused to talk directly with the leaders of either.But on the ground, living amid conflict became a way of life. \"Eastern Ukraine residents were living in a twilight zone -- they were in the front line of a geopolitical despite, and there was a sense of powerlessness,\" said Puri, who spent time on each side of the line of contact while observing the ceasefire.More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014, including 3,000 civilians caught up in the conflict. Ukraine says that since 2014, almost 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with over half of the registered internally displaced persons staying in the areas of Donbas that remained under Ukrainian control and about 160,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region. Russia has meanwhile aggressively attempted to stir up separatist feeling in the region, which it has then pointed to as a justification for invading. Russian passports were offered to residents from 2019, and Kremlin messaging both in Russia and in separatist-held parts of Donbas has heavily played up notions of ethnic Russians being targeted.\"In propaganda since 2014, the Donbas has become a sacrificial lamb in Russian narratives,\" Dobczansky said.\"It's the place where the Russians have cultivated a cult of victimhood. They've managed to turn their own fomenting of a war into a narrative of victimhood at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,\" he added. \"They hammer this point home.\"That pretext ultimately led to Putin, two days before he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, declaring the Donetsk and Luhansk regions independent in an opening salvo to his war on the country.Whether the battle for Donbas will be the final chapter of Russia's war, or merely its next phase, remains to be seen. But by zeroing in on the region, Putin has brought his assault on Ukraine full circle.\"The Donbas was the frontline for eight years, so the military positions on both sides are extraordinarily well-fortified,\" Dobczansky said.The secessionist conflict in Donbas has been costly but stagnant since the initial surges of pro-Russian forces in 2014; the lines of the conflict have barely moved in several years, with trenches running along the point of contact from the southern coast to the Ukrainian-Russian border north of Luhansk.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier this month that \"the battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations, maneuvers, involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, (and) artillery.\"\"This will not be a local operation based on what we see in Russia's preparations,\" Kuleba said at a news conference in Brussels.The terrain and climate of the region does not contrast dramatically with the rest of Ukraine, but conflict there contains its own unique features. \"It's going to be very different to what people have been seeing in Kyiv and Mariupol,\" Puri said. \"The Ukrainian frontline mixes urban and rural territory ... some of the urban territories that Ukraine (will be defending) were already devastated in eight years of shell fire.\"Already, populous cities like Mariupol have been decimated by Russian bombardments. A similar fate is likely for other urban centers in Donbas, and evacuations have been urged from those in the path of expected Russian advances.Now Russia will likely attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east and can attack from northern cities where they have amassed troops, like Izium, as well as from the south and east. A battle for control of Sloviansk has been anticipated, given its strategically significant position in the path of a potential Russian land corridor. Being closer to Russia and Crimea may also ease some of the supply issues that blighted Russia's doomed assaults on central Ukraine. As Russian columns head towards Donbas, they will no doubt encounter Ukrainian forces that have intimate knowledge of the towns and cities they have been defending for nearly a decade. Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhny, and much of the army's top guard have on-the-ground experience fighting in the region after 2014, and several Ukrainian officials have described the battle for Donbas as the pivotal next phase of the war.\"It's more comfortable, militarily, for the Russians to fight a war in the Donbas than it was in Kyiv, Sumy, or Kharkiv,\" said Dobczansky. \"But it's also the place where the Ukrainian army's most experienced and fortified units are located ... so they'll face the most severe resistance.\"",
