        "content": " If you can't answer the question in this week's headline straight away, it probably says more about her than you. She's done so much over such a long period of time, it can be hard to quantify and there simply is no one else comparable.Queen Margrethe of Denmark is also long-serving and widely admired by her subjects but Elizabeth's reign has been longer and she has significantly more subjects.Perhaps we should first ask what the primary role of a monarch is?It isn't to serve for as long as possible; it's to serve well and leave the throne in a stronger position than when you inherited it. In that regard, Elizabeth has outperformed against all odds. She has reigned during a period of change that threatened the monarchy on many fronts. The media revolution put a largely unaccountable institution under unprecedented scrutiny and took away some of the mystique that made it so intriguing. That came with a loss of deference in wider society, which made the monarchy appear even more aloof and unrelatable. But the Queen has a unique ability to turn threats into opportunities and she embraced the media and used it to connect with her subjects, most famously by inviting cameras to film her on walkabouts and among the people. She televised the Christmas message and in doing so inserted herself into the most intimate family moment of the British year. She had an official social media account before any of her grandchildren. But Elizabeth's greatest counterstrike has to be the Commonwealth. When she acceded to the throne, her empire -- once the largest on Earth -- was collapsing. Country after country voted for independence and many saw it as the beginning of the end of the entire institution of monarchy. Elizabeth, then still in her 20s, stopped the rot by throwing herself behind a fledgling group her father had overseen for post-colonial nations. The Queen made the Commonwealth a priority and, under her stewardship, it has grown from eight members to 54 today. Why does that matter? Because it changed the narrative. As quickly as she was losing authority with a collapsing power base, she was regaining it as the figurehead of an association of independent states. She kept her international footprint and modernized at the same time.When she passes the crown to Charles, it will be less vulnerable than it was when she received it and that has to be her greatest achievement. The Queen's long-held wish to ensure the Commonwealth goes from strength to strength with Charles at its helm was granted in 2018, when the body named him as its next head. His ascension into the role was not guaranteed, as the British King or Queen is not automatically Head of the Commonwealth -- member countries choose who takes on the position. Since then, Charles has increasingly placed the modern Commonwealth at the forefront of his work as he prepares for his own reign. He is progressively taking on more Commonwealth responsibilities on his mother's behalf, like when he led the family on Monday at this week's Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. To coincide with the day, he also launched  for students from small island nations, many of which are part of the Commonwealth.  Charles is also set to represent the Queen at a rescheduled meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kigali, Rwanda in late June. It was supposed to have been held in June 2020 and was postponed twice amid coronavirus. In a statement Monday, Charles said it was \"more important than ever\" for members to come together as the world continues to recover from the pandemic. \"As a family of some 2.6 billion people from fifty-four nations across six continents, the Commonwealth represents a rich diversity of traditions, experience and talents which can help to build a more equal, sustainable and prosperous future,\" he added.But don't expect any sort of handover soon. The Queen may not have been well enough to attend this week's event, but in a message from Windsor she dispelled any suggestion that she might step down: \"In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in 1947, that my life will always be devoted in service.\"Thank you to those who sent in your thoughts on the . Many of the responses suggested the royals should lean in more on the tourism option, with a couple of folks even suggesting a hotel or bed and breakfast. Now, that would be an experience!Here are a few other answers: suggested transforming it fully into a \"museum displaying the history of England and the monarchy.\"recalled visiting the palace during the very first year it opened to the public. She suggested opening some of the areas that the Queen has used privately in recent decades, like various state rooms, ballrooms and perhaps her bedroom? \"Let 'common people' feel as if we had been let into the lives of the royals, especially the royal who has reigned the longest of any of them,\" she explained.Meanwhile,  suggested a completely different approach -- turn it into affordable housing. \"It's had its day and is time to use it for something functional for the populace,\" Carmine said. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be making final preparations to depart on their first official joint overseas trip since the start of the pandemic. Their royal tour of the Caribbean to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee year will start in Belize on Saturday before continuing to Jamaica and the Bahamas over the course of the week.It may be a tricky tour for the couple, who are visiting the region  over the royal family's relevance in several countries.Kensington Palace said William and Kate \"are keen to understand more about the impact that the pandemic has had across the Caribbean, and how communities have pulled together to respond.\" The visit will also celebrate the Queen's legacy in the countries, while touching on themes close to their hearts, including the environment, mental health and early childhood.The Royal Collection is reportedly withholding three swords bound for display in Moscow. The Queen's art collection had agreed to lend the 17th-century weapons to Moscow Kremlin Museums for an exhibition focused on dueling. However, permission was withdrawn in mid-February as Russia's troops gathered on Ukraine's borders prior to its unprovoked invasion of the country. \"A decision to postpone a loan of three swords from the Royal Collection to the Kremlin Museums in Moscow was made in mid-February,\" a Royal Collection Trust spokesperson . The museum announced the exhibition, which was due to open on March 4, had been postponed indefinitely. \"The core of the project consists of exhibits from European museums, which were forced to withdraw them before the time due to the geopolitical situation,\" it said in a statement on its website. The British Broadcasting Corporation has apologized \"unreservedly\" to Patrick Jephson, private secretary to the late Princess of Wales, over the methods journalist Martin Bashir used to secure his explosive Panorama interview more than 26 years ago. In the 1995 world exclusive, Diana confirmed Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and described how she believed royal life had made her bulimic. Retired judge John Dyson found falsely suggesting palace staff were being paid to spy on the princess in order to get Diana to speak to him, according to an independent investigation published last year. In a statement, the BBC said it \"accepts and acknowledges that serious harm was caused to Commander Jephson as a result of the circumstances in which the 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was obtained, which have become apparent as a result of the Dyson Report. The BBC apologises unreservedly to Commander Jephson for the harm caused to him and has paid his legal costs.\" The statement added that the corporation had paid \"a substantial sum in damages, which he intends to donate in full to British charities nominated by him.\" Jephson described the settlement as a \"relief\" and expressed his gratitude to Dyson and journalists for bringing \"the truth to light,\" according to Britain's PA Media news agency. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made several donations to on-the-ground organizations to support the people of Ukraine, according to a statement on their non-profit Archewell Foundation website on Friday. Aid from the couple has gone to refugee agency HIAS, mine clearance organization the HALO Trust and a coalition of Ukrainian media supported by the Are We Europe organization. \"All of us at Archewell have been inspired by the work these organizations have taken on -- and also by the stories from those on the frontlines,\" the statement read. Separately, the HALO Trust revealed Prince Harry recently spoke to two staffers, Olesia and Maryna, based in Ukraine. During the call, Harry praised their work, saying they are \"saving lives every single day.\" He added: \"I know that you're going to continue doing the work that is so desperately needed for HALO, for your families and your country.\" Watch some of their conversation below:Remember those ethereal official portraits released in ? Well, the shots taken by fashion photographer Paolo Roversi back in November are heading on a little tour of Great Britain.They are now part of the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is patron. But with the institution closed for redevelopment until next year, the portraits are being sent for display at venues close to Kate's heart. The tour is part of the gallery's \"Coming Home\" project, which sees pieces \"travel to towns and cities across the UK, providing communities with the opportunity to see iconic works locally,\" it said in a statement.Kate helped select the venues for her portrait tour, the gallery said. The black-and-white shot of the duchess looking to the left is to be displayed at St. James the Less Church in the village of Pangbourne, southeast England, from March 22 to April 5. It will then be shown at the nearby Reading Museum from April 7 to June 4. The church, the statement said, \"has welcomed the Middleton family as parishioners over several generations and the Reading Museum was chosen due to its proximity to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where The Duchess was born.\"The portrait of the duchess in a striking red gown is set for the Wardlaw Museum at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, where the duchess famously met her future husband while they were studying.Meanwhile, the other black-and-white portrait of Kate smiling broadly at the camera is headed to Oriel Môn in Anglesey, Wales, where the Cambridges lived in the first years of their marriage, for display between July 16 and October 22.Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said the institution was \"delighted\" to be sending the portraits to locations of significance to the duchess. He described her as \"a very committed\" patron who has a \"great interest in photography and portraiture.\"The Duke of Sussex will not return to the UK at the end of this month. A spokesperson for Prince Harry confirmed the royal will miss the thanksgiving service for his late grandfather, Prince Philip, which is due to be held at Westminster Abbey on March 29. However, the duke hopes to visit his grandmother as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.Despite his absence, Harry will be crossing the Atlantic soon enough. The duke has been brushing up his Dutch skills, according to a tongue-in-cheek promo for his upcoming Invictus Games in The Hague from April 19. In the clip, Harry impresses the local team with his Dutch pronunciation before he shows off his excitement about the event for sick and injured service personnel by changing into a bright orange ensemble. \"Let's go!\" he gleefully announces, pointing to the camera.

        "content": " launched missile strikes near an airport in  on Friday, a strategic  not far from the Polish border that had until now largely been spared from the relentless bombardment witnessed across much of the country during the war. Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant, but that work at the facility had stopped before the strikes and there were no reports of casualties. Ukraine's armed forces say initial information suggests Russia launched six missiles towards Lviv on Friday morning. It says the missiles were most likely air-launched cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Black Sea.Two of the six were intercepted by air defense systems, the armed forces' statement on Facebook said.The attack will add to concerns that Russia's war could spread further west. Here's what you need to know about the importance of Lviv. At about 43 miles (70 kilometers) from Poland's border, Lviv is at NATO's doorstep — so if attacks are ramped up here, it could have international repercussions.Friday's attack comes after Russia launched a barrage of missiles at the , located between Lviv and the Polish border, on Sunday, killing at least 35 people. Lviv has become a safe haven for Ukrainians fleeing other war-torn parts of the country.It hosts more than 200,000 internally displaced people in a city of just over 700,000, according to the mayor. They've flooded into Lviv in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the border.The larger region serves also as a crucial weapons supply route to the Ukrainian military and a wider resistance effort that has foiled Moscow's plans for a blitz-like invasion.Western Ukraine's supply lanes have become even more important as Russia chokes off sea passages and lays siege to the country's south. To the north is Belarus, which hosts Russian troops and has been one of the launching pads of the invasion. Lviv's historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the National Museum houses the country's most complete collection of sacred medieval art and rare religious manuscripts.According to the city's official website, Lviv was the site of Ukraine's first mass actions in support of independence when communism collapsed. On September 17, 1989 Lviv became the site of the largest demonstration in support of revival of Ukraine's independence, with 100,000 participants. The Act on State Independence of Ukraine was passed on August 24, 1991 and hundreds of people flooded the streets of Lviv in celebrations the following day. \"Being an indisputable capital of Ukrainian culture, spirituality and national identity, Lviv has always played a major role in the development of democracy and struggle for Ukraine's independence,\" the website states.Lviv was once part of the Hapsburg monarchy -- then known as Lemberg -- but became the real stronghold of Ukrainian national resistance during Soviet times, according to the country's official . Details on  describe how Lviv, founded in the late Middle Ages, became a flourishing administrative, religious and commercial center for several centuries. Up until the invasion, the medieval urban topography, as well as the city's many fine Baroque and later buildings, were well preserved, according to UNESCO. UNESCO earlier this month it was in permanent contact with all relevant institutions across Ukraine, as well as with Ukrainian cultural professionals, to assess the situation and to reinforce the protection of cultural properties.At the start of the conflict Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General,  said: \"We must safeguard the cultural heritage in Ukraine as a testimony of the past, but also as a catalyst for peace and cohesion for the future, which the international community has a duty to protect and preserve.\"The city has also become the makeshift home for many media organizations and embassies, which were forced to relocate from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.",

        "content": "Abdel Kafi al-Hamdo cannot get  out of his mind. The 36-year-old Syrian spends his days following the news, tweeting messages of solidarity and teaching his five-year-old daughter Lamar how to draw the Ukrainian flag.  He says few can understand what Ukrainians are going through as unimaginable images of war, death and suffering are transmitted around the world. \"No one can understand Ukrainians,\" Hamdo told CNN. \"No one in the world can understand them more than Syrians.\"  For English teacher Hamdo, watching Russia's war on Ukraine has brought back memories of the darkest days of his life -- the siege of his city, Aleppo, in 2016.  Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.The war has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, including dozens of children, and forced more than three million people to flee the country.  But six years before its Ukraine war, Russia began another ruthless  thousands of kilometers away in Syria -- to prop up the Bashar al-Assad regime.  Victims of that war say the scenes from Ukraine on their television screens look hauntingly familiar.  With the help of Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's regime and its allies turned eastern Aleppo into a kill box. Three-hundred thousand of its residents were besieged, cut off from food and bombed into submission in December, 2016. It was a tactic used throughout the war and across the country, including alleged chemical attacks, which it denied. Those who survived the shelling had to leave behind what was left of their homes.    \"They destroyed us; they destroyed our psychology,\" Hamdo said. He recalled going to a hospital days before he left the city only to find himself walking over bodies to get through to his friend.  \"This is what will happen in Ukraine,\" he said. \"What's going on in Ukraine is only the beginning.\"   Some in Syria say their country was the canary in the coalmine that the world chose to ignore. It was a testing ground for Russia's war machine and a preview of its ambitions closer to home.  Hamdo was among a group of Aleppo residents who chronicled their life under siege. They posted daily videos on social media, appealing for the international community to save them. They say their calls fell on deaf ears.   \"What's affecting me a lot is that the world is repeating the same mistake [in Ukraine],\" an emotional Hamdo told CNN. He said it pains him that condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine was as if \"it's [Russia's] first war or first killing.\"  \"I cannot even imagine why people were blinded for 10 years,\" he said.  In 2013, the Obama administration said that the Assad regime crossed a \"\" by using chemical weapons on its own people. But Western states decided against military intervention.  Then, in 2015, the Russian military intervened to prop up a weakened Assad, turning the tide of war in his favor.Today, Russia maintains a presence in Syria and Assad has regained  control of most of the country. Several Arab states have re-established diplomatic ties with his regime.  For Russia, the intervention had multiple advantages. It solidified its ally's power, gave it a foothold in the region and invaluable military experience.  The Russian defense minister even boasted about using Syria as a testing ground for the military.   \"We have tested over 320 [types of weapons], in fact, we have tested all the weapons, except for easy-to-understand versions [in Syria],\" Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was  by Russian state media as saying in August.   Ismail al-Abdullah, a member of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group, witnessed firsthand the impact of those weapons on civilians. He was among the last group of Aleppo residents forced out of the city in 2016, having witnessed the pummeling of Syria's second city by airstrikes. \"Aleppo was like doomsday,\" he told CNN.  \"I saw buildings collapsed on the heads of families and children,\" he said. \"In one of the incidents 34 people were killed under a collapsed building by the bombing.\" Abdullah said that building was struck by a bunker buster bomb.  During its military intervention in Syria, Russia has unleashed an indiscriminate bombing campaign on population centers, having struck hospitals, markets and schools.    The United Nations' Independent Commission for Inquiry on Syria has said regime forces and Russia have indiscriminately bombed densely populated areas, having targeted and killed civilians.  Warring parties in the country have enabled the violation of nearly every core human right and nearly every war crime, Commission Chair Paulo Sergio Pinheiro said in Geneva earlier this month. \"We can only hope that world leaders are doing everything they can to avoid a similar fate for Ukraine.\"   Despite evidence collected by various organizations and witness testimony, Russia denies committing war crimes in Syria.  Many Syrians feel that the impunity with which Russia acted in Syria may have emboldened President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.   \"What happened in Syria is like a lesson for the world that if they did something in the first place to help the Syrian people to stop Russia, maybe this would not be happening,\" Abdullah said. \"Russia would have stopped in the first place in Syria and would not have the courage to invade Ukraine.\"  The White Helmets, who knows Russia's playbook all too well, expressed concern for the situation in Ukraine and has offered tips to Ukrainians.  \"Don't respond to any bombing scene until the sky is clear of war planes,\" Abdullah said, warning Ukrainians about Russia's \"double tap\" bombings.  He lost colleagues in several of those attacks, where warplanes drop bombs on an area then strike the same area again in a few minutes, often killing first responders and those injured from the first strike.   \"Do not walk in open roads,\" he added. \"There will be snipers who will shoot you ... they do not care if you are a civilian, a rescue worker or a paramedic.\"  Members of Abdullah's team gather at their station in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria. They are in a constant state of alert. The ceasefire Russia and Turkey  there in 2020 is fragile. In the second half of 2021, the UN documented at least  by pro-government forces that killed children including those on their way to school.   At refugee camps nearby, where wave after wave of Syrians displaced by those Russian airstrikes are now pressed against the Turkish border. They watch the war in Europe closely. Many feel their fate is tied to that of Ukraine.   \"I am following the news in Ukraine and wish that Ukraine will win the war, so Russia does not go further,\" 48-year-old Umm Hussein said. \"Here in Syria they killed, destroyed and displaced us, making us refugees. If Russia wins [in Ukraine], it will go further and attack us.\"  Despite their fears, there is empathy in the camps for the suffering from a war in faraway Ukraine.      \"We are very emotional and affected by the scenes from Ukraine. As we see children dying, we are crying for them. We feel [for] them as we lived the same suffering,\" she said. The Gulf Cooperation Council has offered to host talks between Yemen's warring parties between March 29-April 7 in Riyadh, Secretary General Nayef al-Hajraf said on Thursday. But the Iran-backed Houthis said they would only attend talks in a \"neutral\" country -- not in Saudi Arabia, which has been leading a coalition battling the Houthis since 2015. The United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed discussed oil and food prices with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov during a visit to Moscow on Thursday.   Tunisia's powerful UGTT labor union will not remain silent if authorities do not include it in a dialog over the country's political and economic future, its deputy head warned on Thursday, rejecting proposed reforms.

Far north in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, scientists are experimenting with plant species to create alternative medicine that can be used in wound healing.   Home to more than 300 species of medicinal plants, Egypt's Sinai is a predominantly desert region between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. It is home to the ancient site of St. Catherine and is popular among tourists searching for a taste of calm and authenticity. Sinai's St. Catherine reserve contains several \"unique and endangered medicinal plant species which have been threatened by overharvesting, collection for use as fuel, and overgrazing,\" according to the United Nations-recognized St. Catherine Medicinal Plants Association. Hassan Azzazy, a professor at the American University in Cairo, is experimenting with three plant species from Sinai to create what he calls \"NanoEbers\" wound dressings made of natural materials that expedite the healing process.  The idea first emerged through a doctoral thesis submitted by his former student and project co-founder, Wissam Sarhan. The two chemists identified the plants in the Sinai with the help of the region's Bedouin tribes, who for generations have relied on herbs and plants for different forms of treatment.  Plants have generally been used as medicine for more than 60,000 years, says the US Department of Agriculture. Sinai's rich natural habitat is ripe for research. \"These are made from biodegradable nanofibers, medicinal plants collected from Sinai,\"  Azzazy told CNN from his university lab in Cairo.  Wounds are often treated with synthetic material to heal skin, yet studies have shown that wound healing can greatly benefit from medicinal plants, according to the US National Library of Medicine.  Azzazy and Sarhan prepare the nanofibers, collect them on a piece of dressing cloth and add antibacterial material extracted from medical plants.  Nanofibers are man-made materials made from a mix of synthetic and natural polymers. \"NanoEbers\" mainly relies on natural materials to build nanofibers, such as honey, bee venom and even parts of shrimp and crab.  Azzazy and Sarhan's project is still in its prototype phase, awaiting approval by the ministry of health and funding for commercialization. Their wound dressings have not yet been tested on humans, as they require approval from health authorities.  100 years ago, Egypt unilaterally declared independence from the British protectorate and established an independent kingdom. While independence was limited, it was a landmark step in Egypt's trajectory toward full independence in 1952. Following mass protests led by revolutionary Saad Zaghloul in 1919, Egypt declared independence on February 28, 1922, and installed the first King of Egypt and Sudan on March 15, 1922. While the British recognized Egypt as an independent state, they maintained exceptions through which colonial control was upheld. Scholars describe Egypt's 1922 independence as limited yet important for the formation of the modern Egyptian state. The British-backed monarchy reigned until the 1952 revolution, instigated by a military coup under Gamal Abdel Nasser and his group of Free Officers. ",

        "content": "The sprawling billion-dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the Black Sea is seen by some Kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of Russian President Vladimir Putin's legacy of corruption.Dubbed \"Putin's Palace,\" the 190,000 square-foot mega-mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs, whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in Russia's notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth -- with him.The property has its own amphitheater, underground hockey rink and private seaport, according to a documentary produced by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption group. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters. The magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800-square-foot apartment Putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure. Yet, despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat, \"I would be very surprised if Putin ever sets foot in there again,\" Nate Sibley, an expert on Russian corruption who advises members of Congress, told CNN. Sibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of Putin pursuing, through the wealth of oligarchs, a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary. While Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career, Sibley said, he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views. That shift, some Russia experts told CNN, may make it more difficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.Putin has positioned himself, as Sibley put it, \"above the fray.\" It wasn't always that way. Nearly two decades before Putin drew international ire for his most recent unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin had Russia's richest man plucked off his private jet and charged him with crimes against the state. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oligarch worth an estimated $15 billion at the time, sat caged in the middle of the courtroom during his highly publicized trial. Khodorkovsky, who had been critical of government corruption under Putin's leadership, was  of tax evasion and fraud, though he argued the charges were politically motivated. Putin  him in 2013 and he has since lived in exile.Putin's bold move against the billionaire oil magnate was seen as a message to other oligarchs: You might be next.The tactic demanded the unwavering loyalty of the oligarch class. The ensuing influx of cash, gifts and goodwill is one explanation for how Putin, who claims a salary of just $140,000 a year, is suspected of being one of the richest people on the planet. He is rumored to own or have access to not only the Black Sea palace, but also a $100 million yacht, according to published reports. CNN was unable to verify Putin's connection to the palace or yacht. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of Putin's purported hidden wealth.That the properties and other possessions aren't in his name doesn't matter, said Tom Burgis, author of a book on international money laundering called \"Kleptopia.\" Burgis likened Putin to The Godfather and said it's understood that when he asks an oligarch for something, it's not really a request.\"Ultimately they owe everything they have to the boss. And with the click of a finger, as he has shown in the past, Putin can take everything,\" Burgis said. \"However influential they may seem, they are ultimately dependent on him.\"Several of Putin's closest associates -- including childhood friends, a woman who was reportedly his former lover, and a professional cellist who is the godfather of one of his daughters, have secretly amassed huge fortunes outside Russia during his time in power, according to leaked financial documents. A complicated web of shell companies, offshore banks and hidden transactions obscures their wealth, with accounts spirited away inside one another like Russian nesting dolls. But a series of leaks in recent years from firms that facilitate the offshore finance system, including the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers, have stripped away some of those layers of secrecy. The assets tied to Putin's inner circle include an apartment in a Monaco luxury building overlooking the principality's glitzy harbor. The fourth-floor flat was purchased in 2003 for $4.1 million by a shell corporation called Brockville Development Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, documents published by show.The real owner of the company: Svetlana Krivonogikh, a former shop cleaner from St. Petersburg who reportedly had a romantic relationship with Putin two decades ago, according to documents obtained by the  and reported on by  and . The company was registered just weeks after Krivonogikh, who was 28 at the time, gave birth to a girl.                                                                                                                             Proekt, an independent Russian media outlet that was banned in the country last year, reported that Putin started a relationship with Krivonogikh in the 1990s before he became President, and that her daughter has a patronymic middle name that means \"daughter of Vladimir.\"Krivonogikh has declined to comment about Putin to reporters, but her daughter -- who had tens of thousands of Instagram followers before recently deleting her account -- has  to interviewers that she shares a resemblance to the President.  In addition to the Monaco apartment, Krivonogikh owns a majority share in a ski resort where Putin has been seen hitting the slopes, several other luxury apartments in St. Petersburg, and a yacht, the Post and the Guardian reported. The leaked documents don't make clear the source of the fortunes amassed by Putin's inner circle. But in several cases, businesses and financial institutions linked to them have won lucrative state contracts. Russia has the largest amount of wealth hidden in offshore tax havens, both in terms of absolute volume -- conservative estimates peg it around  in 2017 -- and as a percentage of national GDP, according to a  by the Atlantic Council.On average, 10% of world GDP is held offshore. However, in Russia, offshore wealth accounted for as much as 60% of GDP in 2015, according to a  research paper, the most recent estimate available. Experts say about a quarter of this dark money is indirectly controlled by Putin and his tight-knit circle of oligarchs and poses a \"\" to the United States. The Mueller report illustrated how Russian offshore accounts were used to interfere in the 2016 elections. Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced the formation of a task force devoted to enforcing sanctions and other economic restrictions designed to isolate Russia from global markets. The KleptoCapture task force will target not only Russian officials and oligarchs, but \"those who aid or conceal their unlawful conduct.\"Gary Kalman, the director of the US office of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group, said enforcing sanctions will not be easy.\"It is extraordinarily difficult for law enforcement to try and 'follow the money' because at some point you are going to literally hit a brick wall,\" Kalman said. \"There is literally no paper trail.\"The United States and the United Kingdom are ideal places to stash large amounts of money, they are among the deepest financial markets in the world, and both accept anonymous shell companies, according to the Atlantic Council.A group of international researchers found that shell companies in the US can be set up in , without having to legally disclose who owns or controls it. For decades, Western companies -- banks and law firms -- have profited from helping Russian oligarchs hide their money, setting up complicated corporate structures that make it nearly impossible to link assets or bank accounts to individuals.In the eyes of some longtime Putin observers, the enigmatic Russian leader has shifted his focus from pursuit of wealth to consolidation of power.\"It's difficult to understand precisely what's happening inside the Kremlin and inside the mind of Vladimir Putin. But he is more and more in a tight relationship with a very small group of people, and they tend to be more on the military and intelligence side rather than business people,\" said Jill Dougherty, former Moscow bureau chief for CNN, \"because, obviously, if Putin cared about business, he would not be prosecuting this war in Ukraine.\"\"Right now it is not up to the oligarchs,\" said Stanislav Markus, an associate professor of international business at the University of South Carolina. \"It is the guns, not the money that speak loudest in the Kremlin today.\"Regardless of whether priorities have shifted inside the Kremlin, Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, argues both the palace near the Black Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrate the way Putin sees himself as much more than a government official. \"He sees himself as a czar, as king of some sort,\" Pevchikh told CNN. \"He has huge plans. He has the vision of him being a historical figure, being so powerful, so mighty, so important, and they invest a lot of money into this narrative.\"Scott Glover contributed to this report.",

The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation confirmed to CNN Thursday that its Special Investigations Unit is investigating allegations that Meadows registered to vote in 2020 at a home where he never resided. The investigation is being carried out in conjunction with the North Carolina State Board of Elections. The state attorney general's office agreed to ask the SBI to investigate Meadows' voter registration after a local district attorney referred the matter to the North Carolina Department of Justice's Special Prosecutions Section, Nazneen Ahmed, spokesperson for Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, said in an email to CNN. \"We have asked the SBI to investigate and at the conclusion of the investigation, we'll review their findings,\" Ahmed said.The investigation comes after  reported that Meadows registered to vote weeks before the 2020 election at a mobile home in Macon County, where he allegedly never lived or even visited.The article quoted the unnamed former owner of the McConnell Road property in Scaly Mountain, North Carolina, as saying that Meadows' wife \"reserved the house for two months at some point within the past few years -- she couldn't remember exactly when -- but only spent one or two nights there\" and that Meadows himself had never even \"spent a night in there.\"North Carolina voter records show Meadows registered at the Scaly Mountain address on September 22, 2020. He voted absentee by mail in the 2020 general election. That registration is still active.Records show Meadows voted early in person in Transylvania County in the 2020 March primary, as well as in the 2018 primary and general elections. Before that, he was registered and voted in Jackson County.The North Carolina voter registration form instructs a person to provide their residential address -- \"where you physically live\" -- and to check a box indicating whether they have lived at the address for 30 or more days. If not, a person must list the date they moved to that residence.A spokesman for Meadows declined to comment to CNN.Macon County District Attorney Ashley Welch, a Republican, sent a letter Monday asking the attorney general's office to \"handle both the advisement of law enforcement agencies as to any criminal investigation as well as any potential prosecution of Mark Meadows.\"Welch said she was \"unaware of any allegation of voter fraud surrounding Mark Meadows\" until she was contacted by several news media outlets last week. In the letter, Welch said she was recusing herself because Meadows made a 2014 contribution to her campaign and had appeared in advertisements endorsing her candidacy for district attorney. \"The allegations in this case involve potential crimes committed by a government official. Historically I have requested the attorney general's office to handle prosecutions involving alleged misconduct of government officials. It is in the best interest of justice and the best interest of the people of North Carolina that the attorney general's office handles the prosecution of this case,\" Welch wrote.Welch's office had no further comment beyond releasing the letter.

The pickup's two occupants, including a 13-year-old boy who was behind the wheel, also died. \"Truth is we may never know what caused this other vehicle to veer over the lane,\" University of the Southwest Provost Ryan Tipton said. As the tight-knit, private college prepares for a memorial assembly next week and a worship team and counselor comfort students, here's what we know about the tragedy. Authorities have not released the name of the boy who the National Transportation Safety Board said was driving the pickup truck. In Texas, a minor can begin the classroom part of a driver education course at 14 but must be at least 15 to apply for a learner license, according to  It's unclear why the minor was driving on Tuesday night. Authorities have not disclosed his relationship to the other occupant, identified as Henrich Siemens, 38, of Seminole, Texas. Preliminary information indicates the left front tire of the pickup was a spare that failed, causing the vehicle to pull hard to the left into oncoming trafficof a two-lane roadway, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Thursday. Investigators identified the remains of the driver by his size, Landsberg said. Both vehicles were probably moving close to the posted speed limit of 75 mph, he said. The members of the men's and women's golf teams were traveling back to campus from a tournament in Midland, Texas, . Around sunset on Tuesday, the Dodge 2500 pickup drove into the approaching lane of a highway just outside Andrews, Texas, and hit the 11-passenger Ford Transit van carrying the teams, according to  DPS. The weather in the area was clear with no fog, CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said. There were no freezing temperatures, and the wind was light at around 5 to 8 mph. \"It was very clearly a high speed, head on collision between two heavy vehicles,\" Landsberg told reporters. The NTSB dispatched a 12-member team to investigate. \"We have literally thousands of pictures that were taken by various first responders and there is no question about the force of impact.\" Landsberg said it's unclear why the full-sized spare failed before the crash. \"On the highways 100 people (are killed) a day,\" he said. \"Every two days we are killing the equivalent of a Boeing 737 crashing. Now just think about that. That's what's putting this into perspective. And it's long overdue that we start to do something about it.\" On Thursday, at least on Interstate 57 in Missouri, the Mississippi County Coroner told CNN. As investigators attempt to determine what caused the collision, the University of the Southwest is dealing with the emotional toll. \"Our institution is crushed and broken but strong,\" Paula Smith, the university's vice president for financial services, said Thursday. Many students at the university -- with an enrollment of about 1,100 students, including about 300 on campus -- will be returning from spring break over the weekend, and the school is planning a memorial assembly for next week, according to Tipton, the provost. \"These aren't the kind of things that you ever even dream of happening. And they shouldn't happen,\" he said.Tipton added, \"For any of you that have lost a loved one or a member of your family, it's the same feeling here. They're not only students and coaches. They are loved ones to us. They are members of our family here on campus.\"One victim was Laci Stone, a freshman  who was majoring in global business management, according to a family member.\"Last night Laci's golf team was involved in a crash leaving a golf tournament. Our sweet Laci didn't make it.,\" Laci's mother, Chelsi Stone, posted on Facebook. \"Our Laci is gone! She has been an absolute ray of sunshine during this short time on earth.\"Laci, 18, of Nocona, Texas, was one of three siblings. \"We will never be the same after this and we just don't understand how this happened to our amazing, beautiful, smart, joyful girl,\" her mother said.

Gary Raines, Karisa's father, said she was \"a beautiful smart young lady who was loved by everyone who knew her.\" \"She was passionate about her God, her family, her education and her golf in that order,\" he said in a statement. \"A friend told me today that she had left a greater legacy in our small town of 10,000 in the short eleven years she lived here than eighty year olds who have lived here their entire lives.

        "content": "When  spoke Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping,in an ongoing flurry of telephone diplomacy. This call -- which went nearly two hours, according to the White House -- comes at a potential turning point for ties between the United States and China. White House officials are watching with growing concern the budding partnership between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and China's response to has proved troubling to western observers. , making for an uncertain stance Biden hopes both to decipher and influence in the call.The White House said after the call that Biden \"described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia.\"\"The President underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis,\" the White House said. The White House said Biden and Xi agreed to maintain \"open lines of communication.\"Conflict and confrontation is not in anyone's interest, Xi told Biden at the start of the call, according to Chinese state media.\"Peace and security are the most cherished treasures of the international community,\" CCTV quoted Xi as saying on the call.White House officials said ahead of the call that they expected it could turn intense; a preliminary meeting between the two leaders' aides stretched for . And Biden upped the stakes when he alluded to his call a day beforehand, declaring his Chinese counterpart \"does not believe democracies can be sustained in the 21st century.\"Biden spoke to Xi at a key juncture. According to US officials,  or financial assistance to Russia, which has requested it as its military sustains major losses in Ukraine. If China agrees, it could dampen its relationship with the West for decades to come.\"We're concerned that they're considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday, confirming what other US officials had been warning for days. Already, the United States has conveyed to some NATO allies it believes China has some willingness to support Russia, though Moscow denies asking for it and Beijing says it's not providing any help.American officials say they believe Xi has been unsettled by Russia's invasion and the performance of Russia's military, which has experienced logistical and strategic setbacks since the invasion began more than two weeks ago. Watching from Beijing, Xi was caught off-guard that his own intelligence had not been able to predict what would happen, even though the United States had been warning of an invasion for weeks, the officials said.US officials don't believe China would be willing to provide Russia with large offensive equipment like tanks or jets. Instead, officials said they believed it more likely China would send smaller items like meals, ammunition, spare parts or surveillance equipment -- if they send anything at all.Officials said it was still possible China helps Russia alleviate the effect of withering Western sanctions through financial support, though it's unlikely the country would be able to completely blunt the effects of the US and European measures.On their phone call, Biden hoped to make clear to Xi the downsides of assisting Russia's war, either through military or financial assistance. He was set to \"make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs,\" Blinken said ahead of the call.It is widely assumed Xi will secure a historic third term in power during the Communist Party's 20th National Congress in Beijing this fall. During such an important year,  Xi will be particularly mindful of the economic risks posed by secondary-sanctions. Trade between the European Union and China topped $800 billion last year and US-China trade was over $750 billion, according to China's official data, while its trade with Russia was just under $150 billion.Yet there remains an ongoing debate within the administration about what steps to take against China should it decide to assist Russia. Biden and his administration have declined to publicly discuss exactly what options they are considering, but have warned that there will  for China if they support Russia.Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, US officials were watching  CIA Director Bill Burns said last week the partnership was rooted in \"a lot of very cold-blooded reasons.\"The two leaders declared their relationship had \"no limits\" in a lengthy document in February, when Putin visited Beijing for talks and to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The document saw China back Russia's central demand to the West, with both sides \"opposing further enlargement of NATO.\" Since then, the partnership without limits has been tested as Xi weighs how to respond to Russia's war in Ukraine. Beijing's evolving response -- from denying an invasion would happen to attempting to avoid Western condemnation by presenting itself as willing to participate in mediation -- has been closely monitored by the White House.US officials have seen mixed signals. When China abstained from a United Nations reprimand vote against Russia, it was viewed as a sign of Beijing distancing itself. And a top Chinese official said last month that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected.But other signs have pointed toward a more accommodating stance, including China's amplification of Russian disinformation. And top US officials have said a lack of denunciation is enough indication of where China's allegiance lies.\"We believe China in particular has a responsibility to use its influence with President Putin and to defend the international rules and principles that it professes to support,\" Blinken said Thursday. \"Instead, it appears that China is moving in the opposite direction by refusing to condemn this aggression while seeking to portray itself as a neutral arbiter.\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- breaching its sovereignty and sending Europe into its worst conflict in decades -- has sent ripples of anxiety across the world. the self-governing island claimed by China.Beijing has recently stepped-up military flights close to the island there and warned against American support. In the early days of the Ukraine conflict, there were fears Russia's invasion could portend a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, even though it did not appear one was imminent.American officials have since downplayed the parallels, saying if anything, the united response to Russia may cause China to rethink whatever plans it had for Taiwan. Russia's invasion has galvanized not only the West and NATO but also countries in the Asia-Pacific -- an outcome American intelligence believed Xi was unprepared for, supposing instead that economic interests would prevent countries there from imposing severe sanctions.Even some on Biden's own national security team were surprised at how quickly some US allies in Asia, including Japan and Australia, were willing to slap sanctions on Russia following its invasion.Biden is fond of citing the long hours he spent with Xi when both were serving as their country's vice president. He has claimed to have spent more time with Xi than any other world leader.Yet they haven't met face-to-face since Biden took office and Xi has not left China during the Covid pandemic. That has left them to meet in web conferences or speak on the phone, a dynamic Biden has said that he does not find ideal.He and his team have worked to establish a policy of managed competition with China. They have left in place the tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump and criticized China for not upholding its commitments from a Trump-era trade deal.Before the conflict in Ukraine, Biden appeared intent on refocusing American foreign policy toward Asia, where he views the competition between the US and China as a defining challenge of the next century. And while the Ukraine crisis has preoccupied the White House in recent weeks, officials insist they are still able to maintain their overriding vision.CNN's Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Two Premier League managers sat before the media to discuss a football match earlier this month. One faced questions on the sanctioning of a Russian oligarch, while the other was asked about the  of 81 men in one day in Saudi Arabia. Premier League matches might have huge global appeal and its broadcast deals are worth billions of dollars, but right now the organization finds itself at the eye of a moral, ethical, and political storm.That storm raged fiercely when played Newcastle United on March 13, a game pitting two of the most controversial club ownerships in world football against each other. It's been dubbed the Premier League's \"game of shame.\"The fixture was played soon after the UK government  Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as one of \"Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin,\" according to a UK government press release.Meanwhile, Newcastle's controversial takeover by the last year also raised ethical concerns even ​before it was approved by the Premier League.The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 ​murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi's murder.The day before the match between Chelsea and Newcastle, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted. Earlier in March, British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who played a key role in the consortium's acquisition of Newcastle, said it wasn't \"particularly fair\" that Abramovich had been forced to sell Chelsea as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"I'm sad someone is going to have a football club taken away because of a link they may have with someone,\" Staveley, who owns a minority stake in Newcastle, was quoted as saying at the Financial Times' Business of Football Summit in London, according to the FT.\"I don't think that's particularly fair to be honest, but we do have to hold all of our relationships to account. We'll always have geopolitical issues, this world is never not going to have problems,\" she added.The sanctioning of Abramovich means Chelsea must find answers -- and quickly -- to an array of questions: how to finish the season, how to ensure a smooth sale to a new owner, and, fundamentally, how to ensure Chelsea Football Club can continue to operate next season.But Chelsea's current predicament also raises uncomfortable oversight questions for the Premier League and the UK government regarding an approach that has often been described as \"light-touch regulation.\"Death and destruction in Ukraine ultimately triggered Abramovich's sanctioning, yet Chelsea's owner did not suddenly become \"close to Putin,\" as the UK government alleged in its announcement of sanctions against him, in the few weeks before or since the invasion.\"He [Abramovich] is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin,\" the UK government said in a statement following the sanctions announcement.Last month, British lawmaker Chris Bryant cited a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns Abramovich had \"links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,\" the MP said in Parliament.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the sanctions.Over 30 spectacularly lucrative years, the Premier League built its multi-billion-dollar industry on a process of self-regulation, with the UK government content to take a non-interventionist approach as it basked in the success of a globally attractive business.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the horror that has subsequently unfolded may be changing all that​.Suddenly, urgent questions are being asked about whether the vetting of new owners should take into consideration the issue of human rights as the UK government finds itself overseeing the sale of one of the country's biggest teams.The Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test lays out conditions that would bar prospective individuals from owning a club, notably prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies.Prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies didn't apply to Abramovich or bin Salman, though following the imposition of sanctions by the UK government, the Premier League Board did disqualify the Russian oligarch as a director of Chelsea Football Club on March 12.One clause stipulates any individual could be disqualified \"in respect of any offense involving any act which could reasonably be considered to be dishonest,\" whether committed in or outside the UK and regardless of whether it resulted in a conviction.Football accountancy specialist Kieran Maguire told CNN that the test presents a low bar to prospective owners and says that is very much by design.\"It's a relatively low hurdle,\" Maguire told CNN. \"And part of the reason for that is because the rules are determined by the owners themselves.\"The last thing they want to do -- given most will eventually be looking for an exit route -- is make the criteria for selling too difficult. This would reduce the pool for buyers, which reduces the price.\"Asked for comment, the Premier League pointed CNN towards the evidence of its chief policy officer Helen McNamara at Tuesday's parliamentary committee hearing.\"This is an extraordinary, complex and unprecedented situation. It's pretty new to all of us,\" said McNamara, referring to the issue of Chelsea and Abramovich.\"We already have an independent panel, chaired by a QC, who oversee our sanctioning regime and we are in the process of putting together an independent panel that will support the Premier League board and scrutinizing their decision making on the Owners' and Directors' Test.\"According to Maguire, the test primarily is designed to ask whether a potential owner has unspent criminal convictions and whether they have the resources to fund the club.  To change any aspect of the test, 14 or more of the 20 Premier League clubs would have to vote in favour.In 2018, Abramovich had issues with his UK visa and was subsequently granted Israeli citizenship, according toThat visa issue came at a time of diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of a former Russian spy with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March. Nonetheless Abramovich continued to own Chelsea.And despite many -- including the fiancée of late journalist Khashoggi -- voicing human rights concerns, the  When the  was announced in October, the Premier League stressed that it was the PIF, rather than the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, behind the takeover.Lawmaker Julian Knight, who chaired Tuesday's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and meeting, told Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston that the Owners' and Directors' Test \"wouldn't have stopped the Saudi takeover, it wouldn't have stopped Roman Abramovich taking over.\"\"It seems to be ... if you have enough money, therefore you can buy a football club. Is that really the right way to go or should there be a more stricter outlook in terms of the integrity of the ownership of a football club?\"Huddleston replied: \"What I can say is that we do recognise there is a need for further refinement and more robust Owners and Directors Test and of course the integrity element of that is something that is being pushed.\" \"We recognize — and the Premier League recognize -- that the Owners' and Directors' Test needs further work, it needs to be a more robust ... but it's really important that we continue to make sure we have a robust and very successful football ecosystem in the UK. \"The Premier League is a major global success story, it's an outstanding export earner for the UK and we welcome investment.\"Asked if he welcomed the Newcastle takeover, Huddleston replied: \"Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK across multiple areas including investment, intelligence, culture and other elements.\"That purchase was a commercial decision which the government did not take part in. That was within the law and within the restriction of the Owners' and Directors' Test of the Premier League.\"Former Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore recently said that the UK government \"actively\" encourages investment by the Saudi sovereign wealth funds.​\"\"I'm not too sure that the Premier League should take any sort of stance that is not, in some ways, consistent with UK law and governance,\" Scudamore told the University of Cambridge's Varsity website.Maguire believes it is \"feasible\" that a human rights clause could be added to the criteria, citing recent comments made by the Premier League's current CEO Richard Masters.Earlier this month, Masters told the FT's Business of Football summit ​that the league had held discussions with Amnesty International about including a human rights section to its Owners' and Directors' Test.Conceding that the test had \"been under a lot of scrutiny for the last 12 months,\" Masters said the Premier League is seeking \"external contributions\" to amend the test. That comes after UK lawmaker Tracey Crouch's review of football called for the reform of the test and for it to come under the control of an independent regulator.Referencing both the test's pending review and discussions of an independent regulator, Huddleston remarked that English football was at a \"turning point.\"\"There has been a bit of a wake up call here,\" Huddleston said, \"particularly as it relates to Russian investment ... The mood's changing -- I think we are at the cusp of quite significant change in sport.\"The change in mood was echoed by leading pundit Gary Neville, who in recent years has been vocal about a range of issues facing the game, notably the idea of a European Super League.The former Manchester United and England defender described recent events at Chelsea as \"a massive wake up call,\" both for himself and English football.Having initially welcomed  -- be it from Abramovich, the PIF, or the Abu Dhabi United Group at Manchester City -- Neville said he was no longer quite so sure about the benefits of the investment of nation states and oligarchs like Abramovich.\"I can imagine the executive of the Premier League sat there looking at their owners and saying, 'What do we do with this situation?'\" Neville told  on Monday. \"They'll be sat there very nervously thinking, 'We don't want to set a precedent here -- what do we do?'\"\"Football is absolutely coming under huge scrutiny,\" Neville added.Meanwhile, the Premier League's bottom line couldn't look healthier.As of next season, a new $6.65 billion package will see the Premier League's international broadcasting income overtake domestic broadcasting rights for the first time, raking in a total of more than $13.8 billion dollars from broadcasting rights alone, according to \"It's indicative of the league's success and appeal to a global audience,\" Maguire said of the deal. \"The Premier League is the envy of all the other leagues in Europe.\"",

If anyone knows who that ball kid is, send me a message and I will send a racket to him. I'm glad he's OK!\"Kyrgios was able to get in touch with the ball boy, who accepted the apology and the offer of a racket, and posted their exchange on social media.During one of his service games, Kyrgios hilariously brought the watching Ben Stiller into an exchange he was having with a fan.\"Are you playing? Are you good at tennis?\" Kyrgios asked the man in the crowd behind him. \"Exactly, why are you speaking?\"He then pointed at Stiller and said: \"Do I tell him how to act? No!\" which drew laughter from the stands.After the match, Nadal told reporters he hadn't seen the incident with the racket, but said \"the ATP should review things and make decisions\" if these incidents continue to happen.Last week, Nadal called for tougher punishments for players after Alexander Zverev received only a suspended eight-week ban for his petulant outburst in Acapulco, Mexico last month.Zverev smashed his racket multiple times near the umpire's feet after his doubles defeat and called the umpire a \"f***ing idiot\" during the match.\"I like him [Kyrgios] like a character, but of course when you cross some lines then the thing becomes different,\" Nadal told reporters after the match. \"The problem is, in my opinion, the same. When you allow the players to do stuff then you don't know when the line is.\"It's a tricky thing, but probably because these situations are happening more and more often, probably the ATP should review things and make decisions. Not about today's match because I didn't see what happened, so I can't have an opinion.\"I hope nothing too bad happened because I wish him [Kyrgios] the best ... but if it's bad, the ATP need to make decisions to avoid that and to stop that because sometimes, even if it's very unlucky or unfortunate, going right in that moment that something negative will happen.\"Up next for Nadal is 18-year-old Spanish sensation Alcaraz, who defeated defending champion Cameron Norrie in straight sets.",

        "content": "As Russia's brutal war in Ukraine disrupts energy supply and  to  on Russian oil and natural gas, leaders in the United States and Europe are scrambling to fill the gaps.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson  advocated for new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea in the name of energy security, and there are talks  and in  of delaying the closure of some coal-fired power plants.  There's also increased pressure on the oil- and natural gas-rich US to produce more to send to Europe, and US President Joe Biden is trying to get  to produce more oil to help bring sky-high gasoline prices down.  This is all bad news for the  — which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels — but they are short-term responses. There is also good reason to believe that the upheaval brought by Russia's war will speed the transition to clean energy in the long run.  While Johnson wrote of more drilling, he also wrote of doubling down on renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. A UK government spokesperson told CNN that a new energy strategy to be revealed next week will \"supercharge\" its renewables and nuclear capacity.In Germany, which is highly dependent on Russian gas, the government  for a full transition to renewables in its power sector by at least five years, to 2035. But in the US, the path toward a clean energy transition has .  \"The war will supercharge the European energy transition — most European leaders understand that diversifying from fossil fuels is a path to greater security,\" Nikos Tsafos, an energy expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN in an email interview. \"The response in the United States has been more bifurcated — some calling for more oil and gas production, others for more investments in renewable energy.\" Ultimately, Europe and the US are on a different footing with their clean energy transitions. The European Union, for example, has a detailed emissions target in law and a road map to  by 2030. Biden's administration has undertaken a number of executive actions and federal regulations to work toward the US emissions goal to cut  by 2030. But his target is lacking legislative teeth.  \"We must walk and chew gum — address supply in the short term because families need to take their kids to school, and go to work, get groceries and go about their lives — and often that requires gas,\" a White House spokesperson told CNN. \"But in the long term we must speed up — not slow down — our transition to a clean energy future.\" The EU road map still needs a vote, but it is backed by policies already underway. And many European countries have more developed clean energy infrastructure than the US, which is just starting to build out its offshore wind. In 2020, the EU and UK had the capacity to produce around 49% of their electricity from renewables, almost twice that of the US' 25%, according to the . The EU and UK combined have about double the solar power capacity and wind capacity of the US, the agency has reported.  \"It's clear Europe has a game plan and the US has a target, which is not the same thing,\" said John Larsen, a partner at the nonpartisan Rhodium Group.  In an interview with The Washington Post, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said Monday he believed the current situation in Europe was the first truly global energy crisis the world has faced — and could shape global energy for years to come.  \"It can be a turning point,\" Birol said, noting that governments responded to the oil shortage of the 1970s by making cars more fuel efficient and investing in nuclear energy. \"I am also hopeful that at the end of the first global energy crisis, countries, not just states, will come up with new energy policies accelerating the clean energy transitions.\" Europe is already heading in that direction.  \"It's amazing how fast the Europeans have moved,\" said Sam Ori, executive director of the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute. \"They're racing toward clean electricity.\" Biden's administration has done several things on its own: proposing new regulations on vehicle emissions and methane; greenlighting offshore wind projects as well as onshore renewables; and taking executive actions on industrial emissions. Still, Biden has been unable to get much of his clean energy and climate agenda through Congress so far, and experts say he doesn't have much hope of reaching his emissions targets without it.   A recent  showed that the clean-energy provisions in Biden's now-shelved Build Back Better Act would have prevented 1.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere through 2035. US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told CNN Wednesday that the current global energy crunch should spur action in Congress as soon as possible. \"This is a moment for Congress to be able to act,\" Granholm told CNN at a clean energy event Wednesday. \"There can be a compromise. There can be movement on this. The bottom line is this is a moment to have this happen; it's an urgent moment.\" But there is no clear path in Congress to transition the US away from fossil fuels. Getting off Russian oil is one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on; a  recently came together to  banning Russian oil imports to the US.  That's where harmony on energy ends.  Instead of simply drilling for more oil and gas, officials in Biden's administration and many Democrats in Congress have long argued that passing billions in tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy is a key way to relieve the US from its dependence on foreign oil, and will help insulate the country against future gas price shocks.  Republicans, on the other hand, argue this is .   In the middle of the two sides sits Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the Democrats' swing vote on climate and clean energy legislation. Manchin has  for Biden's clean energy package, but he represents a coal state, and wants more drilling and fossil fuel infrastructure built. Beyond the future of the US clean energy legislation, more questions remain. Russia is also a major exporter of metals needed for electric vehicles and clean energy technology, which could hamper the transition to EVs.  The fate of Biden's climate policy — and how quickly the US can transition to clean energy — largely depends on Manchin's vote. There's still no actual legislative package that's been agreed upon, and Biden and congressional Democrats realistically have the spring and summer to get a Democrat-only bill through Congress before the midterm elections could upend the balance of power in Washington.  Larsen said that while market forces, like continued high oil prices, could nudge consumers away from gas cars and toward electric vehicles, massive federal investment in EVs and clean energy would still be needed. \"Should these higher prices last for a while, they're going to help make the case for accelerating the transition we see with wind and solar, but it's not the same as policy support to actually get there,\" Larsen said. \"Build Back Better and the [clean energy] tax credits, all of that would do 10 times more than these high prices would.\" CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.",

The engagement news comes three years after Hiddleston and Ashton starred opposite each other in the 2019 Broadway revival of Harold Pinter's play \"Betrayal,\" in which they played a married couple.Hiddleston, best known for playing antihero Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, also showed off his acting chops in films including \"Crimson Peak\" and \"Kong: Skull Island.\" In addition to her stage work, Ashton's acting credits include the films \"Velvet Buzzsaw\" and \"Nocturnal Animals.\" She will star in the upcoming \"Captain Marvel\" sequel \"The Marvels,\" set to premiere next year.Hiddleston, who famously dated pop superstar Taylor Swift, previously revealed that he prefers to keep his romantic relationships separate from his life as a public figure, telling Britain's newspaper in 2017: \"Everyone is entitled to a private life.\" He added at the time: \"I love what I do, and I dedicate myself with absolute commitment to making great art and great entertainment, and in my mind I don't conflict the two. My work is in the public sphere and I have a private life. And those two things are separate.\" ",

        "content": "A trio of Russian cosmonauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov lifted off aboard a Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad in Kazakhstan at 11:55 a.m. ET. The crew's launch and trip to the space station, which should take just over three hours, will be streamed live on NASA's . It's the first spaceflight for Matveev and Korsakov, and the trio will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station. The cosmonauts are expected to dock with the space station at 3:05 p.m. ET and the hatch will open at 5:30 p.m. ET, when they will be welcomed aboard the ISS by two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one European Space Agency astronaut. This will bring the station's crew count to 10. Typically, Russian Soyuz launches include two cosmonauts and at least one NASA astronaut or another international partner due to a crew swap agreement between Russian space agency Roscosmos and other agencies. It's not the first time an all-Russian mission has occurred -- a Russian crew flew to the station in October to film the first movie in space.Although this cosmonaut launch occurs at a time when geopolitical tensions are mounting, the absence of other nations' involvement is coincidental and based on a prior agreement between NASA and Roscosmos to a delayed crew swap for future missions in 2022.\"We still plan to work the crew swap,\" said Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, during a press conference Monday. \"And so we still have scheduled training for Rocosmos to come to Houston, Hawthorne and our team to go over to Star City and train for the Soyuz. \"As far as interactions with the White House -- they are aware that we're continuing these operations. We get questions from time to time, and we answered them, but today we're continuing to work those agreements.\"Montalbano did not respond to a question about extending the ISS partnership with Russia to 2030.When asked whether the current tensions on Earth have translated to the crew aboard the space station, Montalbano said, \"When you're in space, there's no borders. You don't see you don't see country lines or state lines.\" \"The teams continue to work together. Are they aware of what's going on Earth? Absolutely. Astronauts and cosmonauts are some of the most professional groups you'll ever see. They continue to operate well, and there's really no tension with the team. This is what they've been trained to do and they're up there doing that job.\"On March 30, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is set to return to Earth alongside Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov.Vande Hei -- who launched to the ISS in April 2021 -- surpassed NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's record of 340 days in space on March 15, and when he lands in Kazakhstan, he will have set a new record for the amount of time a human has spent in space: 355 days. The space agency sought to reaffirm Monday that it's still working closely with Russian space agency Rocosmos on the International Space Station, despite mounting geopolitical tensions.Joint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, \"continue to go well,\" according to Montalbano. \"I can tell you for sure Mark [Vande Hei] is coming home\" on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, Montalbano said Monday. \"We are in communication with our Russian colleagues, there's no fuzz on that.\"NASA officials did not say there would be any significant changes to plans to get Vande Hei back to the United States after he lands. He'll travel home via a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.For nearly a decade, Russia's Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilities.When Montalbano was asked by CNN's Kristin Fisher about whether NASA has contingency plans in place if the US-Russia relationship further deteriorates, he said: \"The International Space Station, I'll tell you, it's been the flagship model for international cooperation. We talked earlier (about) the interdependency that we have between the US and the Russian segment. That is why we are able to operate and how we're operating...At this time there's no indication from our Russian partners that they want to do anything different. So we are planning to continue operations as we are today.\"",

Studies show that most of us are without knowing it -- which can lead to .How do your beliefs about sleep stack up?Myth. When it comes to sleep no-nos, experts say this is a one. Lying in bed, even with your eyes closed, for more than 15 to 20 minutes is one of the worst things you can do because it will train your brain to associate the bed with a lack of sleep. It can lead to chronic insomnia, Michael Grandner, a clinical psychologist and sleep expert, .\"It's counterintuitive, but spending time in bed awake turns the bed into the dentist's chair,\" said Grandner, who directs the sleep and heath research program at the University of Arizona and the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic at the Banner-University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona.\"You want the bed to be like your favorite restaurant, where you walk in and you start getting hungry, even if youjust recently ate,\" he added. \"You want the bed to do that for sleep.\"That's a fact. Banning smartphones (or any electrical device that emits blue light) from the bedroom an hour or so before bed and all through the night is a must for good slumber, experts say. Light tells the body to stop producing melatonin, the body's natural sleep aid, and studies have shown that blue light is especially toxic to sleep.So when you get out of bed after 20 minutes of sleeplessness, avoid bright light, watching TV or checking social media. Instead, keep the lights dim and do something mindless, such as folding socks. Better yet, try doing one of these tricks to relax your mind and ready yourself for sleep. Actually, it depends. Not long ago the answer from any sleep expert would have been a definitive no. But today, some experts are seeing , at least for a select group of people.\"Pets are making a comeback,\" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associateprofessor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \"For people with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress, having a bed buddy may be helpful in fostering sleep.\"Children, too, may sleep just as well with a pet accompanying them, studies have shown. But people who are light sleepers may find their sleep disturbed by too many \"micro-wakenings,\" which can be harmful to health. In those cases, pet owners may find they need to keep pets on the floor at night or ban them from the bedroom entirely.That's a myth that used to be a fact \"in the olden days,\" Dasgupta said. \"Now the data shows that exercise at any time is better than not exercising due to all the medical benefits, and it helps with stress reduction, which aids sleep,\" he said. \"The data about not exercising at night is when you're doing extreme workouts like Olympic athlete-type exercises.\"People who exercised for 35 minutes right before bed slept as well as they did on nights when they didn't exercise at all, a found.If working out at night does affect your sleep, experts suggest exercising early in the evening so your heart rate and body temperature can return to normal before you hit the hay.\"If you ask me when's the perfect time to exercise, I think it's gonna be in the morning and outside in daylight. It resets the circadian rhythm and starts the day off with vigor,\" Dasgupta said. \"But if nighttime exercise is best for you, that's fine.\"Who doesn't believe this one? Sadly, the science says we're wrong. We may feel better after sleeping in on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but it will be to the detriment of our overall sleep health, experts say. By changing your wake-up time and bedtime on weekends (or day to day), your sleep rhythms aren't predictable, which can alter the body's circadian rhythm.\"You want to build a reliable rhythm, much like the drummer counting the beat for the band,\" Grandner said. \"By controlling when you wake up and go to bed, you're setting the beat.\"Overcome this myth by going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, even on weekends, vacations or after a night of poor sleep.\"The brain likes regularity and predictability,\" he added. \"Waking up at the same time every day and then adding light and movement as soon as you wake up will set your other rhythms for the day and give you increased energy and mood.\"Check out more sleep myths and facts with our .

        "content": "Australian personal trainer Michael Italiano previously had little knowledge of , but that soon changed when he received a surprise text message from an old acquaintance.That message came from Formula One Daniel Ricciardo at the end of 2017, who wanted Italiano to travel the world with him as his performance coach. The pair, who had met through mutual friends in Perth at the age of 12, hadn't discussed the possibility of working together before, and most of Italiano's experience of F1 had come from following Ricciardo's rise through the motorsport ranks over the years.\"I used to watch the races, for sure,\" Italiano tells  as he prepares to enter his fifth season alongside McLaren's Ricciardo.\"Did I know the history behind it? No. Did I know the sport science behind it or how to train a Formula One driver? No. So 2018 was a lot of work.\"The learning process entailed picking the brains of those around him in the F1 paddock, as well as scouring Google Scholar for any available information on the physical demands of driving headlong around a track for two hours.But Italiano's responsibilities don't stop with drawing up fitness sessions for the 32-year-old Ricciardo.An F1 performance coach is charged with ensuring their driver is in prime physical and mental condition at the start of every race -- something that means the pair spend 250 days of the year together.Italiano takes responsibility for massages, nutrition, sleep, jet lag, mindfulness and anything in between to ensure race weekends run smoothly.\"It could be making sure his laundry is getting done, or even making sure he's having breakfast on time, or just cleaning up the room and making sure his backpack is packed and ready to go,\" explains Italiano.\"Little things like that really add up [...] giving him a schedule so that he doesn't have to think [...] kind of running his week so he can just focus on racing.\"The pair are now coming off the back of a three-month preseason in preparation for the first race of the season in Bahrain on Sunday. Italiano has worked on building Ricciardo's neck strength -- a crucial requirement for drivers to withstand the G-force of tackling sharp corners at high speed. And as the sport advances, engines get bigger and cars get faster, placing more demand on a driver's body each year, according to Italiano. \"It's not about just hitting the markers with their neck strength; every year, they need to hit PBs [personal bests] pretty much,\" he says.\"A typical corner on an F1 course might see drivers fighting against four to five G, which is about pulling roughly 35 kilos [77 pounds] on your neck -- quite a big load. \"You might think, 'Okay, it's a corner, it only lasts for one to two seconds.' But you're doing it for two hours, so it can add up quickly.\"In an attempt to build Ricciardo's neck strength, Italiano says he's studied other sports like the NFL, boxing and rugby for inspiration, while he also carries a neck harness with him throughout the season for flexion and extension exercises.\"These guys are under tension in the body pretty much for two hours. They're fighting the car and the vibrations of the car, the resistance of the car,\" says Italiano.That means whole-body strength and cardiovascular fitness become an important factor, too.  \"These guys are in fire-resistant suits, they don't breathe,\" Italiano continues. \"All of a sudden, thermoregulation of the body -- the ability for the body to cool down -- is heavily restricted.\"They're low to the ground, the bitumen is so hot; they've got an engine behind them, which is bringing in more heat. \"The ability to cool down is just non-existent [...] You start becoming dehydrated, you start lacking fluids, you start to fatigue. \"And if you start to fatigue, your reaction times start to hinder. That starts happening, you start losing one or two tenths per lap in a Formula One race. It could be the difference between a podium and finishing in the top 10.\"In the gym during preseason, Italiano has tasked Ricciardo with cardio sessions (running, rowing and cycling), strength exercises (deadlifts, squatting and bench-press) and core stability training. \"We also emphasize training on the posterior chain [muscles on the backside of the body] because a lot of the braking loads -- when they're smashing that brake with their left foot -- is going through the calves, hamstrings and glutes,\" says Italiano.Italiano's influence extends to Ricciardo's diet during race weekends -- meeting with the McLaren team chef to provide guidance on mealtimes, recipes and portion sizes -- adapting to hot climates and high altitudes, and assisting with recovery from travel and jet lag. \"We hired a bit of a jet lag guru and we also have a jet lag app, which helps a lot with caffeine timing, light exposure, adapting to the time zone,\" he says.\"The meal timing on a flight is a big one, and also exercise timing when you land can aid with sleep and getting on the right time zone. There are a lot of factors that affect jet lag. It was the number one thing we really, really tried to hone down on.\"Then there's also mental preparation during a race weekend. \"Something we talk a lot about is getting to that flow state on a Sunday,\" says Italiano. \"The Wednesday or Thursday, it's get everything off your chest day, where it's like: 'OK, mate, what's bugging you? What's on your mind?' Just get it off your chest. \"Qualifying, I like to get Daniel in a very calming state of mind because qualifying is about just perfecting the one lap. And Daniel, he performs very well in a relaxed state for qualifying. \"Whereas race, we want him at an intensity level of about seven out of 10, we don't want him too intense because being too fired up can actually make your reactions worse if you're too fired up.\"Come Sunday when the checkered flag falls at the start of the Bahrain Grand Prix, Italiano will be hoping that his painstaking preparation -- from calf strength to cardio, squats to sleep schedules -- bears fruit.Ricciardo, who placed eighth in the driver standings last season, tested positive for Covid-19 last week, but has recovered in time to compete in this weekend's race. Italiano juggles his work as Ricciardo's performance coach with his own online coaching platform, , which seeks to make elite-level performance training accessible to the public. But F1 remains the priority. He anticipates there will be plenty of nerves as the season gets underway on Sunday, but excitement and curiosity, too.  \"There is an element of uncertainty and unknown,\" says Italiano, \"not knowing which teams have made gains and which teams are a step behind. I find it quite intriguing.\"Those emotions are always accompanied by a sense of pride when he watches Ricciardo take to the racetrack. \"It's been a massive inspiration to see a guy from the same city as me on the world stage,\" says Italiano. \"It's just inspiring to be with him and then also helping him. It gives me belief as a coach as well.\"",

Russian media regulators restricted access to the BBC website earlier this week, having previously taken similar action against its Russian language website. \"I think this is only the beginning of the response to the information war unleashed by the West against Russia,\" Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Telegram post on Wednesday.RT had broken UK broadcasting rules repeatedly, long before the invasion of Ukraine.In July 2019, Ofcom fined RT £200,000 ($263,000) for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its coverage of the Skripal poisonings and the conflict in Syria. It found that RT had failed to maintain \"due impartiality\" in seven programs that aired in March and April 2018.The programs were broadcast after the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. UK authorities said they were the victims of an attack conducted by agents of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU.RT said Friday that the UK ban was \"political.\"\"For many years in the UK they have been looking for a formal reason to close RT, but they have tried to maintain the appearance of freedom of speech. Now the masks are off,\" the channel said in a statement on its Telegram account.",

        "content": "After some of the hundreds of Black students stranded in the besieged city of Sumy, Ukraine,  for help on social media earlier this month, a grassroots group of volunteers sprang into action to help them safely evacuate the war zone. Black Women for Black Lives, a new coalition focused on helping Black residents escape Ukraine in the wake of the Russian invasion, amplified the students' pleas to the international community with the hashtag #SaveSumyStudents. The group started a Change.org petition, which received thousands of supporters, calling on governments to urgently respond to the crisis. And it dispersed upwards of $55,000 dollars in donations to nearly 500 stranded students for food and necessities. Within about a week, the group was  that, after the tireless advocacy work of its coalition and other volunteers, Red Cross buses had been dispatched to provide safe passage to \"all Black students stranded in Sumy.\" The three cofounders behind Black Women for Black Lives — Tokunbo Koiki, Patricia Daley and Korrine Sky — were \"virtual strangers\" until a few weeks ago, according to Koiki, but they shared a collective anguish from watching people that look like them face discrimination while attempting to flee Ukraine. The three women connected via Twitter and formed the organization the first weekend after the Russian invasion began.Since then, the group has raised upwards of $250,000 from donors around the globe to support Black refugees, predominantly African students, fleeing the conflict. It has also partnered with Airbnb to help coordinate temporary housing through the company's charitable arm. And recently, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield praised the group's work, noting she is \"so proud to see Black women leading the way forward.\"\"It all started with a tweet,\" Koiki told CNN Business. \"I wanted to do something for us, that was by us, and I think that has resonated with so many people globally.\"As members of the global African diaspora commiserated online about the plight of Black refugees in Ukraine, they went on to form digital coalitions like Black Women for Black Lives and Black Foreigners in Ukraine, which provide urgently-needed support to the African community caught up in the .More than3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded the country last month, according to the latest United Nations' , and upwards of 2 million people are estimated to be displaced within the country. While some neighboring countries have welcomed White Ukranian refugees with open arms, many  episodes of , racism and even violence as they seek safe passage out.Nearly a quarter of the 76,000 foreign students in Ukraine were African in 2020, the , citing government data. Advocates say these students were drawn to the nation's relatively inexpensive tuition and easy access to European labor markets. The Ukrainian government said in 2015 that foreign students inject upwards of $500 million a year into the Ukrainian economy — almost the entire sum of the financing for the country's public higher education, according . As African students caught in the outbreak of war released pleas for help on social media, grassroots groups of volunteers emerged online to ensure some of the most vulnerable refugees escaping the war are not overlooked. \"We're Black people, we come for our own,\" Janine Anthony, a UK-based sportscaster and volunteer working with Black Foreigners in Ukraine, told CNN Business. \"We protect our own if no one's going to protect us.\"In a war that has unfolded online like no other, these volunteers have turned to a range of tech tools to help. There are Clubhouse chatrooms and detailed Twitter threads that share updates about the situation on the ground; Telegram chats with resources for people on the frontlines; cryptocurrency and NFT-art donations to provide funds for those in need; and online petitions calling for action in aiding the Black residents of Ukraine.  \"Social media was what the students were using initially themselves to tell the world what they were experiencing and facing whilst they were trying to leave Ukraine,\" Koiki said. \"I knew that when we started using social media to amplify our voices and the message that we were trying to put across, that would resonate with people.\"Koiki said she hopes the group's efforts can \"show what is possible\" with collective actions, even if they start on something as seemingly ephemeral as social media. \"I am not able to move mountains, but if I as one person am taking actions and chipping away at that mountain, and everybody else is also chipping away at that mountain, collectively, we can create an avalanche that will bring that mountain down.\"Black Foreigners in Ukraine began with a Twitter Spaces meeting spearheaded by Glory \"Duwa\" Attaochu in Atlanta. The singer and content creator said she initially tried using her Clubhouse room, with 3,000 followers, to spread the messages from African students she was seeing online, but then she shifted to Twitter's rival service at the invitation of a listener.\"It was my first time on [Twitter] Spaces, and we literally ran that Space room for 24 hours straight, no sleep,\" she added. \"And it just blew up.\"Attaochu said her direct messages immediately filled up with people from around the world asking what they could do to help. Among them was Ephraim \"Phoenix\" Osinboyejo, who offered to help translate maps online and coordinate evacuation routes for African students. In its push to help Black students in Ukraine, the group has also had to confront the pitfalls of social media — namely, that information shared online isn't always accurate. The group is now doing its best to act with the urgency that wartime requires while working to vet and amplify messages from students, and eliminate red tape in dispersing aid as quickly as possible. \"This is my job, always trying to ensure that we verify details,\" said Anthony. \"So nobody, none of us in the group, will be accused of peddling false information.\"Black Foreigners in Ukraine now includes 27 volunteers who are using whatever tools they have to provide direct support to those seeking safe passage. They run a handful of Telegram group chats, including one for those who are undocumented and attempting to flee the war. The group helps students connect in groups to travel together more safely and coordinate housing. It also offers tips on its website, such as a guide for how to open a crypto wallet to receive donations or charge a smartphone without a cord. The group has raised some $15,000 in donations, mostly via cryptocurrencies, and shares a public spreadsheet of how those funds are being dispersed to help those on the ground. Going forward, Anthony says it'scrucial to provide legal assistance, visa support, and academic relocation services to these students and refugees so their lives aren't derailed by Russia's war in Ukraine.Black Women for Black Lives is also working to verify requests for donations while acting with life-or-death urgency. The group vets financial requests for assistance via a Google Form on its website and then disperses the funds directly to the students and refugees trying to get out of Ukraine. It mostly issues grants of $50 or $100 at a time.Kolki, the cofounder of Black Women for Black Lives, said she is amazed at the outpouring of support that has flooded in from Black women and allies all over the world, offering whatever talents, time and cash they can. \"You get to see the worst of humanity,\" Koiki said. \"But you also get to see the best of humanity, responding to these tragic circumstances.\"Beyond helping those trapped in Ukraine, these efforts are helping to build a community. Anthony may have only just met the fellow volunteers she's working with or students she's guiding to safety, but she says, \"I don't think we're strangers anymore. We're family, and family sticks together.\"",

        "content": "Judge  has already ruled in epic battles between Congress and former President Donald Trump, rebuffing efforts to shield White House testimony and records. President Joe Biden's , who , twice sided with US House committees trying to wrest information from Trump and his top aides. She endorsed a robust role for judges to resolve clashes between the legislative and executive branches, putting her at odds with GOP-appointed judges who found such politically charged controversies beyond the realm of judicial power. \"What I don't understand,\" Jackson said during a 2019 hearing over testimony sought from former White House counsel , \"is this notion that the judiciary can't play its traditional role in deciding what the law is between these other branches. The Constitution itself sets the system in that way.\" Jackson is certain to face new conflicts between congressional investigators and Trump, as well as with Biden and his successors. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her, including disputes over whether   and whether Trump  by private litigants for the January 6 insurrection.Jackson's cases testing the checks and balances between the branches, among the most important from her nine years on lower courts, offer a window into her judicial method and courtroom style.Overseeing the McGahn case, , sprinkled with lighthearted moments. She announced at the outset that she did not intend to \"truncate\" the hearing, which ended up going four hours. \"It's not my practice to impose time limits,\" said Jackson, then a US district judge. \"I find them distracting.\" As the hours wore on that October 31, 2019, she expressed regret for keeping the lawyers from getting home for Halloween. When she asked a Department of Justice lawyer to speak slower, she added, \"You're an excellent advocate, but I'm just trying to latch on.\" The lawyer said he appreciated the compliment because his mother was watching. She rejoined, \"He's very good.\" In the end, Jackson's 120-page opinion in Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn went against the Department of Justice, which had taken up Trump's effort to prevent the former White House counsel from testifying. The House Judiciary Committee was looking at the time into possible Trump obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and had subpoenaed McGahn testimony. \"Simply stated, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,\" Jackson wrote in her November 2019 opinion, denying the Trump claim of immunity. \"This means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control.\" In a second relevant case, which came before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after Jackson's 2021 appointment to that bench, Jackson joined a decision letting the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol obtain Trump White House materials from the National Archives.  the episode that occurred as Congress was certifying Biden's victory \"the most significant assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.\" The House January 6 committee is continuing to investigate Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including as he appeared at a January 6 rally and told his followers to march toward the Capitol and \"fight\" for their country. Jackson was an active questioner during the November 2021 oral arguments leading up to the ruling in Trump v. Thompson.  that a congressional interest in preserving records and restoring public confidence could outweigh a \"limited intrusion into executive confidentiality.\" Jackson spent eight years on the US district court in Washington and the past year on the US appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit, often referred to as the DC Circuit. When she was up for that DC Circuit position, GOP senators questioned her actions in the 2019 McGahn case and are likely to repeat that focus in the upcoming hearings. At the time, the House Judiciary Committee was considering a Trump impeachment and sought McGahn's testimony related to possible Trump obstruction of the Mueller probe. Jackson expressed sympathy with the House position during oral arguments, saying, \"How can the legislature actually exercise oversight with respect to the executive unless it has some ability to enforce its inquiries, its commandments with respect to ... information.\" She chastised the Trump administration lawyer for appearing to seek a superior role for the executive branch. \"What you've just suggested is that the President of the United States, not the judiciary, gets to decide when privileges are appropriate, when people can testify or not, and that doesn't seem to me to be sort of in the purview of the executive under our constitutional scheme.\" When Jackson ruled a month later, she referred to the Trump assertion that a president could unilaterally determine whether aides should defy a subpoena.  \"For a similar vantagepoint,\" she wrote in a footnote, \"see the circumstances described by George Orwell in the acclaimed book Animal Farm ... 'All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.'\" Jackson's decision issued in November 2019 represented the first major check on the former President's efforts to elude congressional demands for testimony or other information. Her ruling relied heavily on precedent requiring testimony from White House officials during George W. Bush's presidential tenure. She was reversed three months later, however, when a DC Circuit panel declared judges lack the authority to intervene in the McGahn dispute and said Jackson \"gave short shrift to the separation-of-powers principles at stake.\" \"In this case, the dangers of judicial involvement are particularly stark,\" then-US appellate Judge Thomas Griffith wrote. \"Few cases could so concretely present a direct clash between the political branches.\" The full DC Circuit, however, then reheard the case and reinstated the Jackson position that the House case against McGahn was subject to judicial review. Litigation continued, and the two sides eventually reached an agreement in 2021 and McGahn testified . Griffith, who stepped down from the DC Circuit in 2020,to the Senate Judiciary Committee referring to the controversy: \"Judge Jackson and I occasionally differed on the best outcome of a given case. And in one important case involving the former President, I was one of the two judges on a three-judge panel who voted to overturn her decision. However, I have always respected her careful approach, extraordinary judicial understanding, and collegial manner, three indispensable traits for success as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\" Griffith also referred to Jackson's \"historical and exceptional nomination.\" If confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black woman ever to sit on the high court. Senate Republicans who focused on the case during her 2021 hearings are likely to bring it up again. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa challenged her declaration that \"presidents are not kings,\" suggesting she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. \"Did the Department of Justice claim monarchical powers for the President in that case?\" Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in one of his written questions to the judge last year.  Jackson sidestepped the query and pointed to the administration's argument: \"In McGahn, the Department of Justice claimed that the President has the power to prevent certain former staff members from appearing for questioning in response to a valid legislative subpoena, even against (the) will of the former staff member to whom the subpoena is directed—i.e., even when the former staff member would otherwise be required by law to respond to the subpoena, would willingly do so, and would be able to invoke executive privilege in the context of such questioning, where appropriate.\" Picking up on another rhetorical flourish from the Jackson opinion, Grassley then asked, \"Did the Department of Justice claim blood loyalty on the part of Don McGahn?\" Jackson referred Grassley characterizing the administration's position.  The second major Trump case Jackson handled arose more recently, in the context of the ongoing House investigation of the January 6 siege of the Capitol. The former President tried to assert to block the National Archives from turning over the White House documents to the committee. Biden had refused to assert executive privilege, contending the records were crucial to the January 6 investigation. As in the McGahn case, Jackson during those oral arguments showed regard for the House investigative mission, drilling down on whether a former president would ever be able to eclipse the judgment of a sitting president. Joining her for the panel arguments were US Appellate Court Judges Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins, and the session went more than three hours. In their decision, written by Millett, the trio unanimously rejected Trump's effort to shield the materials, finding that Trump had failed to provide grounds to override Biden's judgment and the agreement between the White House and congressional investigators over the documents. \"Under any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality.\" When Trump appealed to the Supreme Court in January, the justices by an 8-1 vote . Only Clarence Thomas dissented, offering no explanation. ",

        "subtitle": "For several months at the beginning of the pandemic, American workers felt genuinely cared for by their bosses, according to a new survey released Friday by Gallup, an international polling organization.",
        "content": "For several months at the beginning of the pandemic, American workers felt genuinely cared for by their bosses, , an international polling organization.By April2020, only a month into the nationwide lockdown, 49% of workers felt warm and fuzzy about how they were being treated by their employers, nearly double the typical 25% who felt that way before the pandemic.  \"Employees felt companies responded quickly at the beginning of the pandemic with genuine concern for them, their work and their lives,\" said Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management andwell-being.But those feelings didn't last. Employees' perceptions of their employers as caring and concerned began to drop in early 2021, according to Gallup numbers. And it didn't matter what type of job -- the decline of well-being affected all industries. Gallup surveys showed that by February 2022 employee cynicism had returned to pre-pandemic levels, with only 24% of the workplace saying their bosses had their best interest at heart.Why would 1 in 4 American employees revert to such a poor opinion of their employers?\"There was a response from employers during 2020 that employees found encouraging,\" Harter said. \"Leaders did a good job of conveying a sense of hope in an unknown situation, they made future plans clear and kept people informed on how they were going to help people work from where they were at, all of which is an element of caring.\"And then I think employers just went back to their normal way of doing things.\"When the country first went intolockdown in March 2020, employers stepped up, Harter said. Many set up pandemic plans focused on keeping workers safe, and they quickly communicated those measuresto employees. Increasing communication was one key to a higher sense of well-being in workers, according to the survey. When employees felt their bosses had communicated a clear plan of action in dealing with the emerging coronavirus threat, 73% of them strongly agreed that their employer cared about their overall well-being.When employees said their supervisor kept them informed about what was going on in their company, 78% strongly agreed that bosses cared, Harter said.Another huge plus -- many employers allowed employees to work from home and were also more flexible about work schedules during the day, Harter said. That allowed people to juggle ever-changing childcare, schooling and home responsibilities during the pandemic, while also doing their jobs well.\"Flexibility was key,\" Harter said. \"Ironically, that was the most desired perk pre-Covid and then 'bam!' People got to really experience it. What was a really slow-moving trend and pattern before the pandemic got turbocharged and became one of those events that just changes the workplace forever,\" he said.Why is this so important? The key reasons are reduced commute times and better work-life balance, he said.Gallup survey results point to that permanent shift, Harter said: \"We've asked people what their preferences are going forward. For those in remote-ready jobs, about 9 in 10 want at least some form of either flexible scheduling, like hybrid work or want to work fully remote.\"I think it is important for employers to address this issue,\" he added. \"Because when we see a gap between preference and how people expect their employer to react, we see lower levels of worker well-being, higher rates of burnout and lower levels of engagement.\"The Gallup survey found the decline in well-being was especially high among managers. That makes sense, Harter said, due to the extra stresses on those key positions during the pandemic.New strains of the coronavirus challenged return-to-work plans, making communication with staff more difficult. A record number of Americans, either in response to Covid-19, more pay and benefits, or .But those were not the primary reasons workers quit, Harter said. Gallup research found abouttwo-thirdsof the reasons people left their job revolved around how engaged they felt at work and whether they felt they were treated with respect.In addition to worker shortages and an ever-shifting landscape, not all managers had received the training they needed to adjust to the new normal of flexible work, Harter said.\"Every employee has a different work-life situation that only managers can understand. Good managers need their companies to coach them into how to give people feedback and have at least one meaningful conversation every week with each employee,\" Harter said. \"That helps understand what each employee is working on and how they're progressing, so they can make adjustments. Those conversations need to happen more,\" he added.Focusing on employee well-being does more than just keep employees from jumping ship, Harter said.Gallup research has shown that teams who feel the company cares about their well-being, achieve higher profitability, productivity and higher customer engagement and have fewer safety incidents, he said.In fact, employees who feel cared for are 71% lessb likely to report burnout, three times more likely to be engaged at work, and five times more likely to strongly advocate for their company as a good place to work. In addition, workersare 36% more likely to say they are thriving in their overall lives.\"This spring and summer will be a huge opportunity for organizations going forward to put things in motion that can lift workers' well-being,\" Harter said. \"They can talk to employees about flexible work arrangements and what makes them more productive individually. What leads to better collaboration with your team, and how do we bring the best customer value in this flexible environment? \"Employees want to do these things,\" Harter added. \"So if leaders can use a framework of how work gets done and how it can fit into an individual's life, employee well-being will likely rise.\"",

When he was done shooting, surveillance footage caught audio of Brevard playing music from what appeared to be a mobile device, Metropolitan Police said, according to the court document. The homeless victim suffered gunshot wounds to his head, face, chest, thigh, buttock and hand, according to court records. The unknown victim survived and still has not spoken to investigators because of the nature of his injuries.Metropolitan Police believe this was Brevard's second shooting. The first is believed to have taken place on March 3 in Washington, DC, where Brevard allegedly shot another homeless person twice in the lower back and the victim suffered a graze wound to the arm, according to the court document. That victim survived, DC Metropolitan Police say. Then, on March 9, police responded to a fire on New York Avenue in Washington, DC just before 3 a.m., where they found a victim, Morgan Holmes, 54, dead with several burn injuries, according to the charging document.The DC Medical Examiner later determined Holmes suffered multiple stab wounds, at least two gunshot wounds along with burns to most of his body and ruled his death a homicide. After canvassing the area for surveillance photos, Metropolitan Police spotted a man they say is Brevard in almost the same outfit as he wore in the previous shooting attacks: a black hood, a black face mask, a quilted black jacket, blue gloves, black pants and black sneakers with white markings on the toe and ankle area. He was holding a mobile device and a white cord, similar to those used for head phones.Multiple cameras caught the man investigators suspect is Brevard walking around the area where Holmes was found. After a few minutes, a man police believe was Brevard left and was seen on another camera at a nearby gas station trying to pump gas into a cup. The man police believe is Brevard was later seen back at the area where Holmes was found. After crouching down multiple times, the video shows a fire being lit, the court document shows. Brevard then allegedly traveled to New York, first shooting a sleeping homeless victim in the arm just after 4:30 a.m. on March 12 on a street in lower Manhattan. He survived and described his attacker to police.Later that day, the New York Police Department responded hours later to a homeless man who was found dead on Howard Street, less than a mile from where the first shooting took place, according to the court document. NYPD later determined, after analyzing the ballistic evidence and partnering with Washington DC's Metropolitan Police, that both homeless men had been shot by Brevard, the court record shows.After several photos of Brevard -- whose identity was not known at the time --  were released by law enforcement in New York and Washington, a tipster reached out to Metropolitan Police and said they recognized the man in the photo. After Metropolitan Police showed the tipster multiple photos of Brevard, the tipster gave them Brevard's Instagram handle, date of birth and phone number, according to the court document. That's when investigators saw a recent post from Brevard, showing him in some of the same clothing he had been wearing in surveillance footage from the shooting scenes, and another photo with the caption \"Feeling Devilish Feeling Godly,\" which was taken in DC.Investigators were also able to obtain Brevard's cell phone number from a \"social media provider\" and then use the cell phone provider to get his location during the previous days. Investigators saw the cell phone data that showed he had been in Washington, DC and in New York. It coincided with the incidents they were investigating, the court document said. Then, on March 15 at 2:30 a.m. investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spotted Brevard and, after his brief attempt to run, he was taken into custody near Pennsylvania Avenue. Further microscopic testing was done on the shell casings that were found at the scene of each shooting, and it was determined that they all came from the same gun, according to the court document.",

        "content": "The US House on Friday passed  that would ban race-based hair discrimination in employment and against those participating in federally assisted programs, housing programs, and public accommodations.The Democratic-led House voted 235-189 to pass the  which stands for \"Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.\" The bill seeks to protect against bias based on hair texture and protective styles, including locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, and Afros. \"Natural Black hair is often deemed 'unprofessional' simply because it does not conform to White beauty standards,\" Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. \"Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people.\"The bill now heads to the Senate, where Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has sponsored the chamber's version of the bill. The Biden administration this week  it \"strongly supports\" the CROWN Act and \"looks forward to working with the Congress to enact this legislation and ensure that it is effectively implemented.\"\"As a Black woman who loves my braids, I know what it's like to feel isolated because of how I wear my hair,\" Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said Friday on the House floor before the vote. \"This is the last time we say no more to Black people being demeaned and discriminated against for the same hairstyles that corporations profit from. No more to Black people being made to feel like we have cut our locs just to get a job. This is the last time we say no more to Black people being made to feel like we have to straighten our hair to be deemed professional.\"Republicans objected to the bill, arguing that federal law already covers this kind of discrimination and that Democrats should be focusing on other issues, like inflation and high gas prices.\"Fourteen months of chaos and we're doing a bill on hair,\" Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Friday, adding, \"I hope we can actually focus on the things that matter to the American people.\"Democrats acknowledged that such discrimination is prohibited under existing federal law, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act but said courts have misinterpreted the law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race, thus allowing discrimination against people who wear natural or protective hairstyles.This is the second time this year the House considered the legislation. The bill failed to pass the House last month when Democrats sought to fast track it. Fifteen Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the bill, but it did not reach the required two-thirds threshold to pass. The House on Wednesday passed a resolution clearing the way for the bill, H.R. 2116, to be reconsidered. The House passed the CROWN Act last Congress, but the bill stalled in the Senate where Republicans had held control. Now, Democrats have a 50-50 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote. The CROWN Act is already law in more than a dozen states, after California was the in 2019.  recently advanced its version of the CROWN Act in the state House, which now heads to the state Senate. ",

        "content": "The information campaign over Russia's invasion of Ukraine is in full swing as a wide cast of characters -- from the US State Department to Ukrainian hackers to Arnold Schwarzenegger-- tries to circumvent Russian censors to get the on Ukraine to Russian citizens. The efforts echo Cold War-era radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union, but messaging apps and other free digital tools mean that an array of outsiders, from digital activists to , the Hollywood icon who posted a video addressing Russians on Thursday, can more easily join the campaign. The State Department created an account on Telegram, a messaging app popular with Russians, four days into the war in Ukraine as it became clear that Washington was missing an opportunity to interact with Russians, a senior department official told CNN. A series of posts on the account in Russian have amplified President Joe Biden's denunciations of the war and cautioned Russians about Moscow's propaganda machine. \"Long before the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it had stepped up its campaign of disinformation and censorship of independent media and continues to do so even during the war of aggression,\" the department said from its Telegram account Thursday. Russian engagement with the State Department Telegram account to date appears to be very modest — the account had 1,911 subscribers as of Friday afternoon Moscow time and the country's total population is around 142 million.Analysts say it is unlikely that any single platform or messaging campaign is going to break through with the Russian public in a significant way. But the goal shared by a range of actors trying to pierce the digital iron curtain is to chip away, cumulatively, at Russian public support for the war and the morale of Russian soldiers.The State Department also has an account on Russian messaging platform VK, has set up a website to rebut Russian disinformation in recent weeks and has worked to get US officials on Russian-language broadcast platforms, the official said. \"None of it is a silver bullet,\" the State Department official said, acknowledging the formidable wall of censorship in Russia, which has to Twitter and Facebook.But some critics have suggested the US government needs to do more and aim to emulate the huge propaganda effort of the Cold War when significant resources were dedicated to pushing messaging toward the Soviet population.Russian authorities have detained thousands of people protesting the war in Ukraine. A Russian state television journalist who interrupted a live news broadcast Monday holding a sign that said \"NO WAR\" was detained and fined about $270 but could still face prison time.\"This is a real Achilles' heel for Putin,\" James Clapper, who served as President Barack Obama's director of national intelligence, told CNN. The US government, he said, should be using any social media platform available to bring images of dead Russian soldiers and prisoners of war to Russian citizens. Several Russian prisoners of war have appeared at news conferences held by Ukrainian authorities. That may be a questionable practice under the Geneva Convention, which forbids states from causing unnecessary humiliation to prisoners of war.\"This sort of thing lends itself to covert action on the part of the US government,\" Clapper said. \"And I trust and hope that we are doing something along those lines.\"The US intelligence community is closely watching public opinion in Russia, but it's not clear whether there is any planning underway to conduct any form of clandestine information operations.\"We're watching what's happening in Russia,\" said one Western source familiar with the intelligence, who added that it is not clear yet whether public opinion is breaking for or against the war.  There are less shadowy ways of supporting the free flow of information into Russia.Alina Polyakova, president of the nonprofit Center for European Policy Analysis, said the State Department's Telegram account is \"a step in the right direction, but frankly it's not creative enough.\"Russians today don't appear to trust Western media or government officials as sources of information the way they did in the waning days of the Cold War, said Polyakova, who grew up in Kyiv in the 1980s. \"We really need to be more creative about thinking who the right messengers are,\" she added, pointing to the numerous journalists who have fled Russia in recent weeks as the Kremlin has criminalized independent reporting on the war in Ukraine. Western governments and philanthropic organizations now have a \"huge opportunity\" to support these journalists as they will likely continue reporting from abroad and connecting with Russian audiences who trust them, Polyakova said.While the State Department lobs carefully worded messages to Russian citizens, a loose band of volunteer hackers from Ukraine and abroad are being more confrontational. The so-called Ukrainian IT army, which Kyiv is actively encouraging, has looked to hack Russian news sites and post information about Russian casualties in Ukraine, according to Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian cybersecurity executive who said he helped organize the hacking collective on behalf of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.Russian citizens \"don't know a lot about what's going on here,\" Aushev said by phone from Ukraine. \"That's why we decided that one of the most important targets should be media. We should bring real news to them.\"But reaching a Russian audience doesn't require breaking into a computer. Americans are among the many people who have sent text messages to Russians using a website built by an international group of volunteer programmers known as Squad303.Stacey McCue, a Florida nurse, has sent roughly 100 text messages and hundreds of emails to Russians using the platform. She began personalizing the messages with her own voice, saying that Moscow has been lying to its citizens and that the war has killed civilians. So far, McCue has gotten only three responses: \"F--- off,\" \"Crimea is ours\" and one reply threatening to \"forward your message to the appropriate authorities! Stop making such calls!\"The hostile responses haven't deterred McCue.\"I think it's better to be proactive, to make a stand, even if it's a small thing to try to influence the overall situation,\" she told CNN.More high-profile Americans are joining the cause. Schwarzenegger, the \"Terminator\" star and ex-California governor, addressed \"the Russian people\" in a video with Russian subtitles he posted Thursday to his 5 million Twitter followers and more than 19,000 Telegram subscribers.\"I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there,\" Schwarzenegger said before detailing the Russian bombing of a Ukrainian maternity ward.It wasn't immediately clear how much traction Schwarzenegger's video may have gotten within Russia. But on Friday, the term \"Arnie\" had broken into Twitter's top 10 list of trending topics within Russia, and numerous containing Schwarzenegger's video were accompanied by both praise and criticism by Twitter users. A source close to Schwarzenegger told CNN that the former bodybuilder made the video on his own accord and wasn't asked to do so by the US government. But the State Department Telegram account wasted no time in sharing the video, and others in the information ecosystem followed suit.Blake Ferrell, a plumber from Indiana, told CNN that he sent Schwarzenegger's video to several Russians on Telegram, and still images of the actor's speech to other Russians via the Squad303 texting platform. Ferrell hasn't received any replies yet, but he wants to keep trying to reach a Russian audience.\"For me, it's the excitement of actually reaching another person,\" he said.CNN's Katie Bo Lillis and Dana Bash contributed reporting.",

A business partner controlling 800 restaurants has \"refused\" to close them, the company said.The burger chain, owned by  , has a joint venture partnership with businessman Alexander Kolobov in Russia. RBI controls just 15% of its Russian Burger King business, and Kolobov is responsible for the \"day-to-day operations and oversight\" of its locations in the country.That means Burger King can't just snap its fingers and close up shop. \"We started the process to dispose [of] our ownership stake in the business,\" said David Shear, president of RBI's international operations, in an . \"While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement.\" , by contrast, owns more than 80% of its restaurants in Russia outright.
