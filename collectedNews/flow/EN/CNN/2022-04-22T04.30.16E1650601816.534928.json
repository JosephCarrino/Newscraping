        "content": "Turquoise LeJeune Parker ends every class by telling each of her students she loves them.The 34-year-old library teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Durham, North Carolina, does everything she can to prove it, and her recent fundraiser, which collected $106,000 to feed her students in need, is her most recent gesture of love.Winter break can mean weeks of food insecurity for children and their families, Durham Public Schools spokeswoman Crystal Roberts told CNN.\"It's a basic human right. We're not talking about raising money to buy people a vacation; this is food, a very, very basic thing,\" Parker said. \"We need to make sure we take care of our schools, because when we take care of our schools, we're taking care of our community.\"Her endeavor, which she named Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraiser, used the money she raised to purchase, pack and distribute more than 5,200 bags full of food to students at 12 schools throughout the Durham Public Schools district.In the dozen schools the project helps, 98% of the students rely on the low-cost or free lunches provided by their school. For many children, it is their main source for food. But once the holidays come around, the schools close and so do their cafeterias.\"Mrs. Parker has always had an army of donors and volunteers at the ready, to champion the needs of her students,\" Lakewood Elementary School Principal James Hopkins told CNN in a statement. \"What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.\"Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. \"I wanted to be a teacher all my life,\" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. \"This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.\"Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.\"I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,\" Parker said. \"'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.\"Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.\"She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,\" Parker said through tears. \"My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.\"On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.\"It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,\" Parker said. \"It took off in a way we could have never expected.\"Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.\"This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,\" Parker said. \"It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.\"With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.\"Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,\" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. \"Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,\" the statement continued. \"Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.\"The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks.",

        "content": "Shahdullah Baig stands among the rubble of what was once his modest two-bedroom home, his belongings buried under debris and broken bricks.\"In the blink of an eye, my home was demolished,\" said the 45-year-old fruit seller, whose kitchen, fruit cart, and cattle shed have ​all been destroyed. \"While I stood there watching... (the police) just walked away.\" Scraps of wood, rusty metal and garbage line the sandy pavement outside his home, where his four young children play.His home was one of several properties in Khargone city's Chhoti Mohan Talkies neighborhood, in India's central Madhya Pradesh state, ​that he says were demolished by authorities following violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims that broke out on April 10 -- the day of the Hindu festival Ram Navami.Authorities have ​defended the demolitions by saying they had acted against both  claiming the houses and shops were built illegally on public land. But Baig and others spoken to by CNN say only Muslim homes have been targeted.Experts say the demolitions are the tip of a far deeper problem and that this is only the latest in a string of attacks on the country's Muslim population, fueled in part by the ​ascendance of India's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They argue that Muslims in BJP-run Madhya Pradesh have been disproportionately punished following the violence, raising fears that members of the country's ​largest minority religion -- about 200 million of India's 1.3 billion population are Muslim -- are being persecuted under the BJP.They point to similar problems in the capital New Delhi, where ​witnesses told CNN that authorities began demolishing shops and other structures in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Jahangirpuri on Wednesday, days after violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims broke out following Hanuman Jayanti, a celebration of the birthday of the Hindu god Hanuman.For Baig, there is an extra sense of injustice.Baig said he and his neighbors were nowhere near the scene of the clashes.\"I don't know what is happening in my country,\" said Baig, who ​says he has lived in the property for more than 30 years. \"But all I can say is that I'm paying the price of being a Muslim.\" The communal violence in Khargone  after groups of Hindu men carrying saffron flags -- a color associated with Hinduism that has in recent years become  -- marched through Muslim-majority neighborhoods on Ram Navami, a festival that celebrates the birth of the revered Hindu god, Lord Ram. The details of the clashes are disputed.  between Hindus and Muslims erupted, with some men throwing stones and holding weapons in the air, according to video from local news outlets. Houses and cars were set on fire, and at least one person died ​-- a Muslim man -- in the clashes, state police told reporters. A curfew was imposed in the city to quell the violence on April 10, and some restrictions were lifted after 11 days, they said. The government said they have set aside a cumulative sum of $131,000 for families affected by the violence. But it is the scenes of state officials bulldozing properties that gained the most attention, with activists and citizens decrying the move as unjust and unlawful.Dr. Tameezuddin Shaikh was at home on April 11 when he received a phone call from a friend informing him that authorities were bulldozing his son's medical shop in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Talab Chowk in Khargone.\"I was stunned,\" said Shaikh, who ​says he often provides free services to impoverished and marginalized families. \"There was a curfew imposed in the city and I had not been given any notice warning of any illegality. I live far away from my medical store, and with the curfew imposed, there was no way that we could go and stop the demolitions.\"About a dozen shops in Talab Chowk were demolished by Khargone authorities, according to Shaikh.  Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra ​described the state's actions ​as a form of revenge,  on April 11: \"From the homes where stones were pelted, we will turn those homes to a pile of stones.\" He offered no proof the ​residents whose homes were destroyed had been linked to the violence.Shaikh said neither he nor his son were involved in the violence. And he has served the local community from that shop for more than five decades without an issue, he added.\"I'm a respected name in Khargone, having served people all my life,\" he said. \"But all the medicines and everything in my clinic worth over 10 lakh rupees ($13,000) turned to rubble.\"Muslim group Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind has filed a petition in India's Supreme Court, urging an intervention into the demolitions, and calling them a \"violation\" of India's constitution.According to lawyer and activist Kawalpreet Kaur, district officers \"cannot take the law into their own hands and cannot be the adjudicating authority.\" \"They cannot decide who is a criminal,\" she said.  Rahul Verma, a fellow from the Centre for Policy Research, said the demolitions in Madhya Pradesh were \"unprecedented.\" \"It's not a job of the municipal office to give punishment to people who might be involved in ​stone-pelting or violence,\" he said.Ayub Khan, a resident of the Aurangpura Square neighborhood, about 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) from Talab Chowk, lost seven shops when authorities demolished them a day after the violence. Khan ​says he lost more than $26,000 in the destruction, and now faces the daunting task of rebuilding without sufficient money. He plans to file a petition against state officials in the country's Supreme Court.\"The demolished shops had stood there for over 70 years and we never received a single (government) notice,\" he said. \"Indeed my shops were demolished because I am a Muslim who refused to bend before BJP leaders. The way the district administration is targeting Muslims after the violence in Khargone, it's evident that they hate a particular community.\"​CNN contacted the secretary for Madhya Pradesh's Home Minister, Secretary Home Minister, Khargone's District Collector and the police, but did not receive a response.Tensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have ​been flashpoints for decades -- even before India gained its independence from the British. But when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014, promising economic reform and development, experts feared his rise could signal an ideological shift ​away from the nation's secular ​norms to​ward those of a Hindu-nationalist state.  The BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu group that counts Modi among its members and adheres to Hindutva ideology -- which seeks to make India the land of the Hindus. Analysts and activists feared Modi's election would leave India's Muslims -- about 14% of the country's population -- According to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, co-author of \"To Kill A Democracy: India's Passage to Despotism,\" the \"demonstrable subjugation and domination of Muslims through their constant humiliation and disempowerment\" is \"central\" to the BJP's Hindutva project. \"It charges the party's Hindu-right voter base, as well as helps enlist more supporters by constantly polarizing voters on the basis of religious identity through a relentless campaign of hate,\" he said.And according to Chowdhury, Hindu vigilante groups are Over the last eight years, several BJP-run states have imposed new laws that critics say are rooted in Hindutva ideology. At the same time, reports of violence and hate-speech against Muslims have increasingly made headlines across the country. The most controversial new laws are in the northern state of, ruled by Hindu monk-turned-politician Yogi Adityanath. The state has introduced laws to protect cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It has also introduced an anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. Most recently, the BJP-ruled southern state of Karnataka  Muslim girls from wearing ​religious headscarves in classrooms, prompting several to challenge the decision in the ​state's top court -- a battle they ultimately lost.  According to Muslim author and journalist Rana Ayyub, Muslims are \"made to feel like victims in their own country.\" \"From what I see in India right now, I feel for my Muslims,\" she said. \"I feel for my brother each time he goes for Namaz (prayers) wearing a skullcap during the month of (Ramadan).\"And the demolition of Muslim-owned properties during Ramadan, according to Ayyub is \"demonizing and demoralizing.\"\"It's like (state authorities) are doing it purposefully,\" she said. \"They're trying to tell us that (during) a month that is sacrosanct for Muslims, 'we are going to humiliate your beliefs and your system'.\"Baig continues to live in a small room in his home -- the only one spared demolition -- with his wife, children and ailing father. They have no running water or electricity. Food is running out, ​he says, and with his livelihood destroyed Baig does not know how he can afford to feed his family.\"With temperatures touching 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit), we are struggling to soothe our crying children,\" his wife Parveen said.Meanwhile, Khargone district officials have posted ​numerous  and  to their official social media, showing police patrolling the streets and bulldozing more properties. \"Do not let harmony become divided,\"  a tweet from Tuesday. \"Create an atmosphere of peace and harmony.\" But Baig ​believes that the very institutions in place to protect him and his family betray​ed him by destroying their home.\"I want to ask the government, how can a man who struggles to make ends meet, but feeds his family by working hard each day, have the means to indulge in (violent) activities?\" ​Baig asked.",

        "content": ", who brings beauty and hope to the men and women living on Los Angeles' Skid Row, is the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year. As she received her award Sunday, Raines thanked her children including her late son, who inspired her work.\"This surely hasn't been easy. I stand before you a very broken woman,\" an emotional Raines said. \"I am a mother without a son and there are a lot of people in the streets without a mother -- and I feel like it's a fair exchange.\"Raines was presented with the CNN Hero of the Year award Sunday night by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa. Online voters selected her from among . Raines and her non-profit have been a mainstay on Skid Row for the past six years, providing food, clothing, and hair and makeup services to thousands of people.Every week, Raines and her team of volunteers set up shop and transform part of Skid Row -- home to one of the nation's largest concentrations of homeless people -- into an outdoor beauty salon.Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal or a hug.\"It's not so much just giving them makeup or doing their hair, it's also the physical touch,\" Raines said. \"People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.\"As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award.Raines struggled for years with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her young son, Demetrius.  \"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.\"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.\"Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.As Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.  \"We just had to use our best judgment and figure out some ways to still keep them fed, while keeping them safe, and while keeping us safe,\" Raines said. Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.\"My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying. But I've certainly gotten better. I can say his name now. He is the reason I do what I do.\"If you know someone who is making the world a better place, you can nominate them as a 2022 CNN Hero at . If you would like to support Raines' work or any of the non-profit organizations of the Top 10 CNN Heroes, you can also make a donation via .

        "content": "In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and . It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.\"Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  \"btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?\"His mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.\"I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,\" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.\"But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,\" she says. \"I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.\"Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. \"What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,\" she says. \"I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help.\" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to , the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. \"It was so long, I got bullied for it,\" he says. \"Some people called me a girl.\"Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. \"Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,\" says his father, Joe Simons. \"He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.\"At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a \"pandemic suit\" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.\"His bear is very well taken care of,\" his mother says.Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. \"She really turned him on to being a public servant,\" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. \"My best goal is to be a president,\" he says. \"That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people.\" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit.",

In addition to water loss due to an , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.That's enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the , according to the report.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are  -- if not worsen -- in the coming months.Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin.

Together with the neighboring city of Kunshan — which locked down earlier this month — it plays With no sign that the Chinese government is prepared to ease restrictions soon, concern is mounting about the economic damage they are causing, and the shock waves an extended lockdown will send around the world.Shanghai is the epicenter of the current Covid outbreak, but it's not alone — analysts at Nomura estimate that full or partial lockdowns are in place in 45 Chinese cities, affecting a quarter of the population and about 40% of the economy. Premier Li Keqiang warned on Monday for a third time in a week of the threat the upsurge in Covid posed to the Chinese economy. Here's three reasons why the rest of the world should be watching Shanghai closely, too. It has the largest GDP of all Chinese cities — 4.32 trillion yuan ($679 billion), the third largest stock market globally by value of the companies that trade there, and the fifth greatest number of  in the world.Shanghai is also the most attractive destination for international business eying a presence in mainland China.By the end of 2021, more than 800 multinational corporations had established regional or country headquarters in Shanghai, according to city authorities.

Trading continues despite the lockdown, but some banks and investment firms have been asking staff to sleep by their desks to keep the market functioning.The pool of companies listed in Shanghai is heavily focused on large, state-owned enterprises that play a central role in the Chinese economy. They include the world's most valuable liquor maker , banking and insurance giants like ICBC and  , and state oil company  .The Shanghai exchange is also home to China's answer to Nasdaq -— Shanghai accounts for 3.8% of China's GDP.

The number made up 16.7% of China's total container shipmentslast year.Shanghai is also a major aviation hub in Asia. The city's airports  — Pudong International Airport and Hongqiao Airport — handled 122 million passengers in 2019, making the city the fourth busiest hub in the world after London, New York, and Tokyo.But the Covid outbreak has made port delays worse and forced the suspension of many passenger flights, sending  and putting even more pressure on global supply chains. Shanghai port remains operational, but industry data released in late March  that the number of vessels waiting to load or discharge had skyrocketed to a record high. State media also  that many truck drivers were struggling to get containers in and out of the port on time because of travel restrictions.The Greater Shanghai Area,which includes Kunshan and several other eastern cities, is a major manufacturing hub for industries from cars to semiconductors.  and General Motors both run factories in Shanghai in partnership with state-owned automaker SAIC Motor. Shanghai is also home to   first gigafactory in Asia.

They qualified for the race by securing endorsements from 500 mayors and/or local councilors from across the country.Macron and Le Pen received the most votes, but since neither won more than 50%, they will head to a runoff on Sunday. This isn't the only national vote France faces this year -- parliamentary elections are also due to take place in June.Macron and Le Pen held one debate on the evening of April 20 .Le Pen appeared much more prepared than in the event in 2017, when her poor performance effectively doomed her campaign. Le Pen attacked Macron on economic measures, arguing he hasn't done enough to help French families cope with inflation and rising energy prices, while Macron went after Le Pen's ties to Russia and previous support for President Vladimir Putin.A poll found that 59% of voters found Macron to be the more presidential of the two.The runoff election will then take place on Sunday April 24. Candidates are not allowed to campaign the day before the vote, or on election day itself, and the media will be subject to strict reporting restrictions from the day before the election until polls close at 8 p.m. Sunday in France.A much closer contest than the 2017 election. Macron and Le Pen both increased their total share of the vote in this year's first round compared with 2017, but surveys ahead of the first round earlier this month showed Le Pen enjoyed a late surge of support in March. Polling by Ifop-Fiducial released on April 10 suggests Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%. Macron's advantage has slightlyincreased , according to the same polling.Political analysts often say the French vote with their heart in round one, then vote with their head in round two -- meaning they choose their ideal candidate first, then opt for the lesser of two evils in the second round.Macron saw this play out in 2017. He and Le Pen scored 24% and 21.3% of the first round vote and then 66.1% and 33.9% in the second round, respectively.To be reelected, Macron will likely need to convince far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon's supporters to back him. Melenchon came in third place with 22% of the vote. On Sunday, Melenchon told his supporters \"we must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,\" but did not explicitly back Macron.Most losing candidates urged their supporters to back Macron to block the far right from winning the presidency. Eric Zemmour, a right-wing former TV pundit known for his inflammatory rhetoric, urged his supporters to back Le Pen.The unexpected.At the start of 2022, the looked set to be an important referendum on the rising popularity of the French far right. It has been 20 years since a French President was reelected, so the vote was shaping up to be one of the country's most watched political races in decades.Then Russia invaded Ukraine.  With Europe's eyes fixed firmly on Putin's bloody war, priorities have quickly shifted: Ammunition stockpiles, high-stakes diplomacy and even the threat of a nuclear strike have all entered the national debate. Macron , taking him away from the campaign trail, while Le Pen was forced to backtrack on her previous support for Putin.France's political landscape, for one. Macron's election effectively blew up the traditional center of French politics. In years past, many of his voters would have flocked to the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. But Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist candidate, and Valérie Pécresse, the Republican candidate, failed to persuade voters to abandon the centrist candidate already in office. Both polled under 5% in the first round. Macron is an ex-investment banker and alumnus of some of France's most elite schools. He was a political novice before becoming President, and this is only the second political election he has ever stood in.But he is no longer an upstart and must run on a mixed record.His ambitious plan to bolster the European Union's autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, even though his attempts to  or to prevent the , and his unsuccessful  could be considered failures. Macron's domestic policies are more divisive and less popular. His handling of the yellow vest movement, one of France's most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive.Macron's signature policy during the crisis --  to go about their lives as normal -- helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency.Ahead of the first round of this election, Macron refused to debate his opponents, and he has hardly campaigned himself. While his pole position in the race has never really been under threat, experts believe his strategy has been to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to keep the focus on his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Le Pen is . She is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the National Front, the predecessor to Le Pen's current political party. The younger Le Pen has attempted to rebrand the party, as it has long been viewed as racist and anti-Semitic.This is her third shot at the presidency. This year and in 2017, she outperformed her father in the first round of the vote.In 2017, Le Pen campaigned as France's answer to Trump: A right-leaning firebrand who vowed to protect France's forgotten working class from immigrants, globalization and technology that was rendering their jobs obsolete.Since then, she has abandoned some of her most controversial policy proposals, like leaving the European Union. But by and large, her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, skepticism of Europe and position on Islam in France -- she wants to make it illegal for women to wear headscarves in public -- have not changed. \"Stopping uncontrolled immigration\" and \"eradicating Islamist ideologies\" are her manifesto's two priorities. Le Pen has, however, attempted to soften her tone, especially around Islam and the EU in the wake of Brexit.Instead, she has campaigned hard on pocketbook issues, promising measures that she claims will  in the coffers of each household, including a pledge to remove sales tax from 100 household goods.The strategy appears to have worked.Le Pen's performance in the first round of the 2022 presidential election was her best result in the three times she has run.The cost of living is among the top issues for the French electorate this year. Faced with the economic fallout from the pandemic, high energy prices and the war in Ukraine, voters are feeling the pinch, despite generous government support.While financial pressures may be insufficient to whitewash some candidates' extremism in voters' minds, they may push some to look for unorthodox answers to their problems.The fighting in Ukraine is a long way from the bistros and cafes of France, but the conflict is certainly on voters' minds. Just shy of 90% of French people were worried about the war in the last week of March, according to Ifop. Given his challengers' patchy record on standing up to Putin, this has likely played in Macron's favor so far.Notably absent from the first-round debate was the environmental crisis. Although the importance of climate protections is gaining traction globally, it's less of a concern in France, which sourced 75% of its electricity needs in 2020 from nuclear energy, according to the French environment ministry. Most candidates in the first round backed the kind of nuclear development Macron has already announced, so there is little divergence on this issue.However, Macron and Le Pen have sparred over wind and solar power. Le Pen argues that the two are expensive and inefficient -- she also says wind turbines have scarred the landscape of the traditional French countryside -- so she wants to scrap subsidies for both. Macron wants to further invest in both technologies.The Macron and Le Pen campaigns are promising two very different visions for the future of France. Macron promises to continue forging ahead with a globalized, free market-focused France at the head of a powerful EU. Le Pen wants to completely upend the status quo with protectionist economic policies and a revamping of Paris' relationship with its allies and adversaries.But in the end, the election may simply come down to which candidate France dislikes least: The President who is widely seen as elitist and out of touch, or the challenger best known for her inflammatory rhetoric on Islam and support for authoritarians.Journalist Elias Lemercier contributed to this report",

Musk said the proposed deal is not about the economics of   business, but about ensuring Twitter remains a trusted platform for democracy — describing his vision in characteristically sweeping terms.\"This is not a way to make money,\" Musk told TED chief Chris Anderson. \"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.\"The Tesla and SpaceX CEO railed against what he saw as a lack of free speech on Twitter, and said Twitter should open-source its algorithm to increase transparency in the company's content moderation decisions. That would reflect a major shift in how Twitter operates.\"The code should be on Github so people can look through it and say, 'I see a problem here,' 'I don't agree with this,' they can highlight issues, suggest changes,\" said Musk. Asked how he would change Twitter's content moderation, Musk explained that his test for whether a platform adheres to free speech principles is simple: \"Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.\"Musk mused that if a tweet were particularly controversial, perhaps the company should not promote that tweet, but added, \"I think we want to be very reluctant to delete things and just be very cautious with permanent bans; timeouts are better.\"Musk acknowledged that even if he purchased the company, there would still be errors.\"I think everyone will still blame me for everything,\" he said. \"If I acquire Twitter and something goes wrong, it's my fault, 100%. I think there will be quite a few errors.\"Asked whether he had a backup plan if his bid to purchase Twitter fails, Musk said he has \"various\" ideas. But he coyly declined to elaborate, saying those would need to wait \"for another time.\"",
