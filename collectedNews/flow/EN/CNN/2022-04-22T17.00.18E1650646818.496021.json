        "content": ", who brings beauty and hope to the men and women living on Los Angeles' Skid Row, is the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year. As she received her award Sunday, Raines thanked her children including her late son, who inspired her work.\"This surely hasn't been easy. I stand before you a very broken woman,\" an emotional Raines said. \"I am a mother without a son and there are a lot of people in the streets without a mother -- and I feel like it's a fair exchange.\"Raines was presented with the CNN Hero of the Year award Sunday night by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa. Online voters selected her from among . Raines and her non-profit have been a mainstay on Skid Row for the past six years, providing food, clothing, and hair and makeup services to thousands of people.Every week, Raines and her team of volunteers set up shop and transform part of Skid Row -- home to one of the nation's largest concentrations of homeless people -- into an outdoor beauty salon.Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal or a hug.\"It's not so much just giving them makeup or doing their hair, it's also the physical touch,\" Raines said. \"People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.\"As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award.Raines struggled for years with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her young son, Demetrius.  \"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.\"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.\"Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.As Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.  \"We just had to use our best judgment and figure out some ways to still keep them fed, while keeping them safe, and while keeping us safe,\" Raines said. Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.\"My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying. But I've certainly gotten better. I can say his name now. He is the reason I do what I do.\"If you know someone who is making the world a better place, you can nominate them as a 2022 CNN Hero at . If you would like to support Raines' work or any of the non-profit organizations of the Top 10 CNN Heroes, you can also make a donation via . All donations made by January 3 will be matched by Subaru up to $50,000 per Hero.To learn more, like , follow  and the . CNN's Alicia Lee contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Turquoise LeJeune Parker ends every class by telling each of her students she loves them.The 34-year-old library teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Durham, North Carolina, does everything she can to prove it, and her recent fundraiser, which collected $106,000 to feed her students in need, is her most recent gesture of love.Winter break can mean weeks of food insecurity for children and their families, Durham Public Schools spokeswoman Crystal Roberts told CNN.\"It's a basic human right. We're not talking about raising money to buy people a vacation; this is food, a very, very basic thing,\" Parker said. \"We need to make sure we take care of our schools, because when we take care of our schools, we're taking care of our community.\"Her endeavor, which she named Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraiser, used the money she raised to purchase, pack and distribute more than 5,200 bags full of food to students at 12 schools throughout the Durham Public Schools district.In the dozen schools the project helps, 98% of the students rely on the low-cost or free lunches provided by their school. For many children, it is their main source for food. But once the holidays come around, the schools close and so do their cafeterias.\"Mrs. Parker has always had an army of donors and volunteers at the ready, to champion the needs of her students,\" Lakewood Elementary School Principal James Hopkins told CNN in a statement. \"What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.\"Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. \"I wanted to be a teacher all my life,\" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. \"This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.\"Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.\"I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,\" Parker said. \"'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.\"Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.\"She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,\" Parker said through tears. \"My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.\"On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.\"It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,\" Parker said. \"It took off in a way we could have never expected.\"Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.\"This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,\" Parker said. \"It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.\"With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.\"Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,\" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. \"Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,\" the statement continued. \"Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.\"The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks.",

        "content": "In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and . It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.\"Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  \"btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?\"His mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.\"I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,\" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.\"But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,\" she says. \"I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.\"Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. \"What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,\" she says. \"I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help.\" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to , the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. \"It was so long, I got bullied for it,\" he says. \"Some people called me a girl.\"Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. \"Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,\" says his father, Joe Simons. \"He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.\"At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a \"pandemic suit\" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.\"His bear is very well taken care of,\" his mother says.Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. \"She really turned him on to being a public servant,\" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. \"My best goal is to be a president,\" he says. \"That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people.\" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit.",

        "content": "The glittering skylines of Hong Kong and Shanghai have long been associated with wealth and glamor. But in recent weeks, they have become synonymous with a much grimmer reality, as authorities in the two international finance hubs struggle to contain raging Omicron outbreaks.Extreme Covid measures have heavily restricted the lives of residents in both cities, with Shanghai now entering the third week of government-mandated home lockdown, and Hong Kong chafing under a third year of quarantine and travel curbs. Once China's gateways to the West, heavy-handed border closures and suspended air routes have closed the two cities off to much of the world, even as other hubs open up. On Tuesday,  arrived in Hong Kong from outside Asia Pacific --a stark contrast to the pre-pandemic era when the city's airport was one of the world's busiest, regularly hosting 1,100 passenger and cargo flights daily to and from 200 international destinations. Now most of the traffic is outbound, carrying residents fleeing Hong Kong for greener pastures with fewer restrictions. In February and March, more than 180,000 people left the city while only about 39,000 entered, according to immigration data.Shanghai, like Hong Kong, is home to large numbers of foreign residents -- but fears are growing that too could soon change.Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, estimates China has lost about 50% of all European expatriates since the pandemic started -- and he warns there could be another exodus of families this summer when the school year ends. \"I wouldn't be surprised if another half of (those remaining) leave,\" he told CNNA recent report by the British Chamber of Commerce in China appeared to back up this assessment, noting that international schools in China could see at least 40% of teachers leave ahead of the upcoming school year -- which could prompt more families to relocate.Driving these departures is China's adherence to an uncompromising zero-Covid policy that relies on a combination of strict border quarantines, home lockdowns and mass testing in a bid to stamp out infections.But those measures no longer appear sufficient in the face of the latest Omicron wave. Hong Kong recorded the  in Asia and Oceania last month as cases spiked and the virus ripped through elderly care homes. Shanghai plunged into crisis soon after, with all 25 million residents placed under mandatory home lockdown in late March. Many in Shanghai have complained of being unable to access food, basic supplies and even medical care during emergencies. Reports of health workers forcing elderly residents into quarantine and of workers killing a pet corgi after its owner tested positive fueled  toward the government on Chinese social media.\"Shanghai is really pushing us to the corner. They don't treat us like humans at all,\" one user wrote on Weibo, China's highly censored Twitter-like platform.\"I really can't understand. How could it be this bad? What's happening to Shanghai?\" another popular Weibo comment read.Before this wave, Shanghai officials had prided themselves on their less disruptive approach to containing outbreaks, and had avoided the kind of citywide mass testing seen in other major Chinese cities. Hong Kong, too, had once been lauded as a zero-Covid success story. Though it had previously faced several outbreaks, its death rate remained low until a fifth wave arrived in February. The risk of infection seemed so low that many residents -- particularly the elderly -- didn't view vaccination as a priority, leaving much of the city vulnerable when Omicron struck.Now, as a growing number of residents look to leave, that sense of relative safety -- and both cities' standing as international capitals of travel and commerce -- seems further away than ever.\"We've gone over a month without making any money as a business,\" said Josh Vaughn, an American entrepreneur in Shanghai who owns an online sunglasses brand. \"It makes me stressed thinking about it because I don't know when this lockdown is going to end ... I'm so scared that this could be the end of my business.\"Vaughn said that after contracting Covid this month he faced hostility from his neighbors, who were reluctant to let him back into his apartment building after he was discharged from hospital -- echoing similar experiences from other expatriates who have felt ostracized.Wuttke, the European Union Chamber of Commerce president, warned that the economic impact of China's Covid restrictions could push some foreign companies to consider moving regional headquarters out of greater China -- throwing the future of major business hubs like Shanghai and Hong Kong into question as the rest of the world opens up. Singapore, which for years for the title of Asia's top international business hub, was the first Asian country to declare it was moving away from a zero-Covid policy to living with the virus last year. Some in Hong Kong's business sector are now eying the Southeast Asian city state, which lifted  for vaccinated travelers in April.Chinese authorities have acknowledged this precarious position, with Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam saying in late March, \"I have a very strong feeling that people's tolerance are fading ... that some of our financial institutions are losing patience about this sort of isolated status of Hong Kong, as Hong Kong is an international financial center.\"In an effort to boost Hong Kong's flagging economy, Lam lifted some flight bans and shortened quarantine requirements last month. But it may be too little, too late -- especially as Chinese officials and state media ramp up rhetoric praising China's zero-Covid policy, offering little hope that these international financial centers will open up anytime soon.Gabriele, an Italian resident in Shanghai who asked to be identified by his first name only, tested positive in early April and has since been confined to his apartment for more than three weeks, he said. Describing the situation as a \"nightmare,\" Gabriele said health workers said they would come to test him again but \"never showed up,\" and attempts to contact local authorities have gone nowhere. \"We feel helpless,\" he said.Now, he's thinking of moving home for good -- leaving behind a city he had once loved. \"The city completely lost its shine. I don't know if it will recover,\" he said. \"It's like a completely different city ... it really feels like we're going backwards in time instead of looking forward to the future.\"Additional reporting by CNN's Akanksha Sharma and Michelle Toh",

        "content": "As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on  and , many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store's parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, . (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers' cars cool on hot, sunny days.) As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.\"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\" Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America's campaign for , told CNN. \"Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there's no better place than the roofs of America's big-box superstores.\" Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted  on .Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.   CNN reached out to  — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company  having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company  it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's . It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company's stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. \"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\" Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the , said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it's doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led  that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a  to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.  \"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. \"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\"CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.",

In addition to water loss due to an , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.That's enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the , according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.It's bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are  -- if not worsen -- in the coming months.Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin.

And let's be clear about the root cause: Resistance to LGBTQ equality.The impending removal of Walt Disney World's special tax district is wrapped up in anti-big business rhetoric. But the chain of events that led to \"DeSantis versus Disney\" began with the Florida GOP's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law.Homophobia and hate are right underneath the surface of the high-minded talking points about \"parental rights in education.\"Of course parents have rights-—but right-wing media stars and conservative lawmakers are galvanizing viewers and voters by demonizing transgender teachers and condemning inclusive Disney shows.The most incendiary commentators throw around terms like \"child abuse\" and accuse opponents of \"grooming\" kids for sexual predation, sometimes by taking a teacher's comments grossly out of context, or acting like one outspoken educator represents an entire profession.It is a conservative backlash to growing acceptance of gay and transgender people, with entire networks and websites programming to a fear that conservative beliefs are being trampled on.\"We're seeing these issues weaponized all over the country,\" Democratic political strategist David Axelrod said on CNN Wednesday night.Florida is one of the focal points. When Republicans in the state pushed the \"parental rights\" bill that came to be known as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law earlier this year, a wide variety of opponents said the law could hurt the LGBTQ community by creating a chilling effect. , the state's largest private employer, did not initially take a public stance against the bill, which infuriated LGBTQ employees and allies.The internal revolt prompted both an apology and an adjustment by Disney CEO Bob Chapek. His professed support for those employees and his halt to political donations in Florida provoked stark criticism from Republicans in the state. That's when state lawmakers took aim at the unique status that lets Disney operate as an independent government around its Orlando-area theme parks. Taking cues from DeSantis, the GOP-controlled state Senate voted to eliminate Disney's privileges on Wednesday and the state House voted the same way on Thursday.It is a move \"widely seen as retaliation\" by DeSantis and his loyalists,  of The New York Times wrote.The \"Don't Say Gay\" undercurrent is undeniable. Florida Republican state Rep.

That means Disney will have a lot of time and room to negotiate.Disney, seeing no upside in commenting, has remained silent about the matter. But DeSantis, sensing a political advantage as he plots a 2024 presidential run, is unlikely to let up. \"If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy,\" he asserted in a campaign fundraising email on Wednesday. -- Kadia Goba's framing : \"Florida Republicans are trying to change the narrative around their push to end special incentives for Disney by saying they're protecting free markets, a shift away from what they've explicitly said it's about in the past: retaliation against the company's support of LGBTQ rights...\" -- Colby Itkowitz has a story about this on the front page of Thursday's Washington Post. \"The rapid escalation in public support for the LGBTQ community's rights in recent years had quieted much of the blatant homophobia in the nation's political discourse,\"  \"But, in recent weeks, Republicans have reverted to verbal and legal assaults on the community, sometimes employing baseless tropes that suggest children are being groomed or recruited by defenders of gay rights.\" In short: Call Democrats criminals, garner right-wing media coverage, raise money, win elections...",

        "content": "Investors have  on companies like   that were growing fast during the recovery from the pandemic but are now sputtering. Yet  , which skeptics have long said is overvalued based on rosy projections for the future, is experiencing a much softer landing.What's happening: Tesla shares have dropped 7.5% year-to-date, just a bit worse than the S&P 500. They fell 5% on Wednesday as Wall Street worried that its first quarter earnings, like Netflix's, would be much worse than expected.That didn't happen. Tesla posted a  of $3.3 billion in the first three months of the year, handily beating Wall Street's forecasts. Its shares are up 7% in premarket trading on Thursday.Tesla's stock has come under some pressure in recent months. Investors are pulling back from riskier wagers as interest rates start to rise, and Tesla is not immune to supply chain problems. But it's been more resilient than some may have predicted, given the broader climate for stocks. Here are a few reasons why. Tesla's earnings for the start of 2022 were strong. And despite plenty of challenges, its outlook is solid.CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that Tesla should be able to produce 1.5 million vehicles this year, beating 2021 by 60%. Production at the company's factory in Shanghai, which had been halted by coronavirus lockdowns, \"is coming back with a vengeance,\" he added. The company is planning to split its stock for the second time in two years, a move that could make it more accessible for everyday investors by reducing the price of each share.When Tesla announced that it would ask shareholders to approve a split late last month, its stock shot up 8%. Like all automakers, Tesla is grappling with rising costs and supply chain snarls. The price of metals it uses in batteries, like nickel and lithium, jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shipping, energy and labor have also gotten more expensive. But Tesla has been able to offset higher costs by raising prices for its vehicles.\"It may seem like maybe we're being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long,\" Musk said.He added that the company wants to make electric vehicles as \"affordable as possible,\" but that decades-high inflation is making that more difficult., its most affordable model, could eat into some demand. But JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman told clients Thursday that the company may be in a better position than some competitors \"given its generally longer waitlists and loyal and aspirational customer base.\"Risks remain: That doesn't mean Tesla's stock is protected from a sell-off. Bank of America analyst John Murphy noted Wednesday that the company's stock \"may already be priced for perfection (or at least priced for hyperbolic growth).\" That will make logging fresh rallies — or holding onto its gains — a trickier endeavor.Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has  on Netflix as the streaming service's stock implodes.The latest: Ackman told investors that his firm, Pershing Square Holdings, sold its shares in Netflix on Wednesday after the company reported earnings. That locked in a loss of more than $400 million.Ackman bet $1.1 billion on Netflix just a few months ago.\"While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,\" Ackman wrote.The company's stock plunged 35% on Wednesday after it announced that it lost subscribers last quarter for the first time in more than a decade. It expects to shed another 2 million subscribers this spring.It was Netflix's worst one-day performance since 2004 and wiped more than $50 billion off the value of the company.Ackman said that changes to the outlook for subscriber growth dramatically affect how Pershing Square values Netflix's stock. While he expressed support for proposed changes, including a version of Netflix that includes ads, he said they make it difficult to anticipate how the business will perform.\"Based on management's track record, we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value,\" Ackman said. \"That said, we believe the dispersion of outcomes has widened to a sufficiently large extent that it is challenging for the company to meet our requirements for a core holding.\"Not just Netflix: Investors are getting worried about the wider streaming industry as the soaring cost of living encourages households to cut back on extra expenses. Disney's stock dropped more than 5% on Wednesday, while   fell 6%.Home prices in the United States  in March as buyers scrambled to close deals before mortgage rates rose even further.According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of an already-built home in March was $375,300, up 15% from the year before, my CNN Business colleague Anna Bahney reports.As the cost of borrowing increases and personal expenses climb, demand for homes is expected to fall back. Last week, mortgage rates  for the first time in more than 10 years.But for now, the market remains red hot. \"The housing market is starting to feel the impact of sharply rising mortgage rates and higher inflation taking a hit on purchasing power,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Still, homes are selling rapidly, and home price gains remain in the double-digits.\"Supply of homes remains tight, and professional investors are flooding the market. They're flush with cash, which adds to competition for limited properties.Remember: The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  that it was worried about the run-up in housing prices, and saw signs that a dangerous bubble was forming. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   report results before US markets open.   follows after the close.Also today: Initial US jobless claims for last week post at 8:30 a.m. ET.Coming tomorrow: A key gauge of the health of top economies, the Purchasing Managers' Index.",

Sequoia, a prominent Silicon Valley firm that's invested in Musk before, co-led the investment with Vy Capital. The deal values the Boring Company at nearly $5.7 billion.Loop is a mostlyunderground transportation system that offers point-to-point trips between stations where people board Tesla SUVs.  is already operating in Las Vegas with two stations that are about a mile apart at the Las Vegas Convention Center. There are plans to expand the system throughout the Vegas strip, with 51 stations over 29 miles.The Boring Company is also developing a project in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and is in conversations with San Antonio, Texas. It's previously announced projects in Chicago, Washington, DC and Los Angeles, but has not completed them. It faced a lawsuit from unhappy Los Angeles neighbors, and fell out of favor when Chicago elected a new mayor. Permits have for its DC to Baltimore project, which dates back to .\"We're still very enthusiastic, and want to move forward,\" Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis told CNN Business on Thursday.He said the government is collaborating with the Boring Company on engineering issues on the project, which would connect downtown and a nearby beach.

He declined to say when it might be completed. if essentially running a subway system, but with cars rather than trains, is an efficient use of tunnels, which can cost as much as $1 billion per mile to build. The Boring Company says it's developing cheaper tunneling technology, and argues its system is superior to traditional subway systems because trips will be point-to-point, and not make any planned stops, like at other stations. (But they could potentially be ahead of them.)Musk, the CEO of Tesla, previously pitched a more grandiose vision for the Boring Company, with people being whisked through cities in dedicated autonomous vehicles at speeds up to 120 mph. But the reality so far, in Las Vegas at least, has involved human drivers operating what resemble standard Teslas at 35 mph.The Boring Company still says it plans to eventually transition to fully autonomous operations, which will reduce the cost of operations. Sequoia said in a blog post that the Boring Company is at an \"inflection point.\"\"The next few years are about 10x'ing performance by making their systems rapidly reusable and fully autonomous,\" it wrote.The Boring Company says its next generation machine for digging tunnels is designed to be capable of operating remotely and autonomously, requiring no one in the tunnel. Its current iteration of the machine, called Prufrock, is designed to dig up to a mile per week. Digging tunnels quicker is critical to lowering costs. The Boring Company has said it also plans to build utility and freight tunnels. It did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.The , a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the , which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO's standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\"This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,\" Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. \"(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.\"It's the first major global air quality report based on WHO's new , which were . The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including ,  and other respiratory illnesses.Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around  were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the  analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw  in pollution, the report showed.\"The (United States') reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,\" the authors wrote.Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country's most vulnerable and marginalized communities. \"We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,\" said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. \"We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we're still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we're seeing in major cities.\"Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which  in July.   China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a  of polluting industries in the city.The report also found that the , which had acted as the world's major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year.  and  have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. \"This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.\" Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. \"When you don't have that data, you're really in the dark,\" Hammes said.Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country's air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\"I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,\" Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. \"However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.\"The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\"We've got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,\" she said. \"There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we're on (would be) irreversible.\"",

That's an overly simplistic, binary view of the world. Instead, investors need to do their homework and find companies with strong business models and healthy fundamentals.\"Not all businesses are created equally,\" said Paul Moroz, chief investment officer with Mawer Investment Management. Moroz said that it's going to become more important to find companies that aren't as dependent on discretionary consumer spending. He noted that firms like insurance broker   and UK-based cleaning supplies firm   are examples of \"boring\" companies that are doing well. And even within the tech sector, Moroz said he likes   because of the steady subscription revenue for its many business software products.The Big Tech leaders of the  are a broad and diverse group. That's why investors shouldn't assume that Netflix's problems are bad for the rest of the tech sector or that Tesla's good news gives traders the all clear sign to buy every momentum stock in sight.\"First quarter results so far highlight our view that investors need to be selective,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a report this week. Haefele added that \"Tesla's record profit underlines rising global demand for electric vehicles,\" and also pointed out that \"the disappointing outcome for Netflix shouldn't obscure the robust outlook for subscription services.\"Netflix's big miss could wind up being a company specific issue. It's not necessarily a reason to shun all of the other FAANGs.Of course, investors are still willing to flock to companies that are reporting strong results. The success of Tesla shows that traders are not afraid of high-priced stocks that value investing gurus like Warren Buffett tend to avoid. Yes, Tesla is expensive when you look at traditional price-to-earnings ratios and compare Tesla with the rest of the auto industry. But as long as Tesla lives up to the hype, that may not matter. \"Tesla's ability to achieve a trillion dollar valuation...is a confirmation that paying up for future earnings potential is still a rational investment with the right business model,\" said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates, in a report Thursday.
