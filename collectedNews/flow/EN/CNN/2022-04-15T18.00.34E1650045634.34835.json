The list of atrocities and apparent war crimes allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine gets longer by the day. As Ukrainians reclaim areas previously occupied by invading Russian troops, evidence of the horrors of recent weeks is emerging from the rubble of shattered villages and towns. New victims are discovered on a daily basis. And those lucky enough to have survived the ordeal tell harrowing tales of kidnappings, rapes and torture. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said Monday that her office is investigating 5,800 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with \"more and more\" proceedings opening every day. Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians. But CNN journalists on the ground in Ukraine have seen firsthand evidence of atrocities at multiple locations across the country. Here is what we saw.Novyi and Staryi Bykiv are two tiny specks on the map, separated by a small stream. Together they form a sleepy community of about 2,000 people that you'd expect few Ukrainians -- let alone the Russian army -- to be familiar with.Katerina Andrusha told me that's why her daughter Victoria decided to leave her apartment in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary and come back here at the start of the war; she believed it would be safer at home.But on February 27, residents say Russian forces rolled into the neighboring villages, turned the local school into their base, vandalized and looted homes and terrorized the people here for five weeks.On March 25, Katerina said Russian soldiers came to her home and took Victoria, claiming she had information about their forces on her phone.Three days later, Katerina herself was taken captive. She said she was held in a cellar for three days. Blindfolded and terrified, she tried to find out what had happened to her daughter.\"They told me she was in a warm house and that she was working with them and would be home soon,\" said Katerina.She said she hasn't seen Victoria since. As she spoke to us, Katerina's gaze drifted skyward in disbelief. She showed us pictures of her daughter, a beautiful schoolteacher.\"We hope that she will get in touch with someone, somewhere,\" she said.Just a few streets away, we met another mother. Olga Yavon's grief was raw and all-consuming. She knew why we were there and the moment she came out to greet us, she broke down in tears.Her boys, Igor, 32, and Oleg, 33, are among six of the village's young men who authorities say were executed by Russian soldiers on February 27.She told us Russian forces rounded them up after a bridge nearby was blown up.The Russians kept hold of their bodies for nine days before dumping them on the outskirts of the village, with instructions to bury them quickly, she said.\"They were very good boys,\" Olga said. \"How I want to see them again.\"I have seen a lot of awful things in my career, but some of the things we were confronted with on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian troops were beaten back by Ukrainian forces have been among the most harrowing. In the suburb of Bucha we were among the first to reach a  that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.We saw half-buried bodies, legs and arms sticking out of the earth. We met  here; he broke down and could not stop crying. The neighbor who comforted him was also in tears. These moments of heartbreak are difficult to witness -- they make you want to cry as well.Also in Bucha, we were led into a  -- the Ukrainians say the men had been executed by Russian troops. Some had their hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head or the heart.You could still see the horror on their faces. It seemed like the dead wanted the truth of their violent death to be uncovered.No matter how many bodies you see, you never forget a single one.At 10:30 a.m. last Friday as many as 4,000 people in and around the  were waiting to be evacuated when a missile exploded overhead, raining down chunks of metal. Shrapnel ripped through the crowd, which was largely composed of women, children and the elderly. The latest death toll is more than 50, with more than 100 injured. When we , we found the concourse still stained with blood, littered with the scattered possessions of the dead and wounded. On one platform, we found a large pool of congealed blood in a shrapnel impact point with several false teeth nearby. Someone, probably an elderly person, must have been hit and killed there. City officials believe Kramatorsk could be surrounded, besieged and pulverized by Russian forces if and when the much-anticipated offensive in the east gathers pace. The mayor had been urging residents to leave, and prior to Friday's strike around 8,000 people a day were boarding westbound trains. The evacuation effort had been publicly announced, with people from surrounding towns and villages urged to gather at the railway station in Kramatorsk, which was the major regional hub. There was nothing secret about it.  Russia has , claiming the missile -- a Tochka-U -- is no longer used by Russian forces, and alleging that it was a Ukrainian missile that hit the station. Military analysts dismiss the claim.Part of the missile crashed into a small park in front of the station. Someone, somewhere wrote on it in Russian \"for the children.\"While tagging and writing slogans on missiles, bombs and shells is a very old tradition, it is not for certain what the intended message was.  The worst thing I have seen since arriving in Kyiv nearly a month ago would have to be the body of a man we were shown in a , northwest of Kyiv.We were led to the site by the owner of the house, who had fled town in the first few days of war. She returned as the invading troops withdrew, only to find her home had been ransacked by Russian soldiers. Behind her garden shed, she showed us a man, with a bag over his head, his hands tied behind his back and his trousers pulled down, exposing his underwear and heavily bruised leg. He had a gunshot wound to the head, and a single bullet case was still lying next to his body.He appeared to have been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers, although we do not know for sure what happened to him.By this time, we had already seen the now infamous mass grave in Bucha, but the image of that man has stuck with me -- I find the individual more relatable than the collective. It is easier to compartmentalize, to dissociate a group from the humanity they were robbed of.I keep thinking about that man and who he might have been. Did he suffer? Did he have a family? What were his ambitions? What led him to that backyard? Did he fight back, did he protest against the Russian occupation? What if it had been me â€” or my brother, who was living in Kyiv when the invasion started?This man is one atrocity too many. And then you realize there are countless others, still waiting to be found, underneath some rubble, in a shallow grave or in someone else's backyard.",

        "content": "This time last year, the brand new, stunningly effective Covid-19 vaccines were rolling out across the country, injecting a strong note of optimism into the United States' once fumbling pandemic response.Millions of people were lining up daily to get their shots. Instead of the steady drumbeat of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, we were tracking a new number: the percentage of Americans who had been vaccinated. This number, we believed, was our best chance to beat the virus.The US was caught up in a fever dream of reaching herd immunity, a threshold we might cross where vulnerable individuals -- including those too young to be vaccinated or those who didn't respond well to the vaccines -- might be protected anyway because, as a community, we would weave an invisible safety net around them.With herd immunity, if someone does get infected by a virus, they are surrounded by enough people who are shielded against infection that the virus has nowhere to go. It fails to spread.As a country, we had reached this point against some formidable viruses, such as rubella and measles. We thought we could get there with Covid-19. We were probably wrong.\"The concept of classical herd immunity may not apply to Covid-19,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with CNN.And that \"means we're not going to be without SARS-CoV-2 in the population for a considerable period of time,\" said Fauci, who recently co-authored  for the Journal of Infectious Diseases.Fauci points to measles as an ideal case study in herd immunity.Like the virus that causes Covid-19, the measles virus spreads through the air. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around them will catch it if they are not immune to it, . Some experts have estimated that the Omicron viruses are as contagious as the measles.The US eliminated transmission of measles and has successfully kept the virus from circulating in this country because of three things: an extremely effective vaccine; a virus that doesn't change, or mutate, in significant ways over time; and a successful childhood vaccination campaign.The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease, . Once a person is vaccinated, studies have determined that protection lasts virtually their whole lives.Many states in the US had once reached an ambitious public health goal of getting more than 90% of their children vaccinated against the disease by the time they started kindergarten.This high level of vaccination coverage, the durability and effectiveness of the vaccine, and the relative stability of the virus have helped the United States prevent major outbreaks of the disease for more than 20 years.Still, herd immunity has to extend beyond the borders of the United States. Each year, a certain number of cases arise when travelers bring it into the country, but it has never regained a foothold here and continued to circulate, because we have community-level protection against it. isn't infallible. In the United States, herd immunity against measles is wearing thin in many parts of the US -- and indeed around the world -- because of vaccine hesitancy.The World Health Organization  that measles could become endemic again around the world as more people refuse their shots.Covid-19, unfortunately, isn't playing by those same rules.\"Bad news number one,\" said Fauci, is that the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 changes a lot and in significant ways.\"We've already experienced over a period of two years that we've had five separate variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron. And now BA.2 from Omicron one,\" he said.  \"Bad news number two is that there's a lack of a wide acceptance of safe and effective vaccines,\" Fauci said. Put simply, not enough people have been vaccinated.The more contagious the virus, the more people have to be vaccinated to stop it from ripping through a community, according to Dr. Adam Kucharski, co-director of the Center for Epidemic Preparedness and Response at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In a July 2021  and in a recent interview with CNN, Kucharski explained how expectations around herd immunity have to shift as viruses become more contagious.Kucharski estimated that for a virus as contagious as the Delta variant, 98% of the population would need to be vaccinated if the vaccines we have could prevent 85% of transmission of the virus.If the vaccines didn't prevent transmission to that extent, he said, then herd immunity probably wouldn't be possible with the vaccines we currently have.In a May 2021 published in the journal Eurosurveillance, Kucharski and his co-authors explain that much of herd immunity also depends on how well the vaccines prevent transmission -- the act of an infected person passing the virus to someone else.Vaccines that prevent transmission are said to convey sterilizing immunity. The measles vaccine creates sterilizing immunity. The Covid-19 vaccines do not. While vaccination reduces the chances that you might pass Covid-19 to someone else, contact tracing  it still happens.If not enough people get vaccinated -- which has to be virtually the entire population for highly contagious variants -- or the vaccines we have don't stop nearly all transmission, we may not be able to reach herd immunity for Covid-19 until most people have developed immunity after getting the infection, Kucharski wrote in the article.There are other factors to take into account, too, such as the durability of immunity over time.\"Not only is vaccine induced immunity not lifelong, but infection induced immunity is not lifelong,\" Fauci said, which means we're going to need repeated exposures to either vaccines or infection to keep our defenses up to speed.Some are not ready to completely give up on the idea, however.Barry Bloom is an emeritus professor of public health at Harvard University. He says one way to get there would be to make better vaccines.Companies are working on vaccines that would target more stable regions of the virus, including the stem of the spike protein, that doesn't appear to mutate as much. That might create more durable immunity that could stand up to to the shape-shifting of the viruses' variants.There are also promising nasal spray vaccines that may help develop antibodies in nose and throat. The hope is that these vaccines may generate immunity in the tissues its most needed to create the kind of sterilizing immunity that prevents transmission.If not a vaccine in a nasal spray, Bloom says, why not put monoclonal antibodies in a spray you could take daily before leaving home to prevent transmission of the virus?\"And the question is are they good enough to wipe it [the virus] out before they're asymptomatically transmitted? Or is it a constant game that we're going to have to live with?\" Bloom said in an interview with CNN.Or, Bloom says, maybe the best we can expect is an assist from evolution. He says the virus is changing to become more contagious over time, but not necessarily to cause more serious disease. Ultimately, killing a person doesn't do the virus much good. It needs hosts. It would be much better for the virus to evolve to become as contagious as it can be, but maybe with less propensity for causing severe disease.Bloom thinks this is probably what happened to the coronaviruses that now cause common colds. He thinks they probably once started as fierce predators but evolved over time to just be pests.That way, they get to live on, but so do we.",

        "subtitle": "The Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva rests deep beneath the Black Sea this morning.",
        "content": "The Russian  rests deep beneath the Black Sea this morning.Whether it lies there as the victim of Ukrainian missiles, Russian incompetence, bad luck or a combination of all three is unclear. What is certain, though, is that the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years will raise troubling questions not only for Moscow, but for military planners around the world.The ship sank off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday.Russia's Defense Ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship's stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles and that these sparked the fire that detonated the ammunition.US and Western defense officials seem to favor the Ukrainian account.The US believes with \"medium confidence\" that Ukraine's version of events is accurate, a source familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror on May 2, 1982, during the Falkland Islands war.The General Belgrano and the Moskva were of similar size -- each about 600 feet (182 meters) long and displacing 12,000 tons -- though the crew of about 1,100 aboard the General Belgrano was more than double the size of the Moskva's crew of about 500.Russia has not disclosed the number of casualties occurred during the Moskva's fire and subsequent sinking. A total of 323 crew died when the General Belgrano went down.The biggest effect may be on Russian morale. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war. Though Moscow carefully manages news about the war in Russia, it will be hard to hide the sudden absence of such a large ship. And its loss will raise doubts about Russia's warfighting abilities, whether it was due to enemy action or accident.\"Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies -- either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship,\" analysts Mason Clark, Kateryna Stepanenko, and George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War wrote in their daily war briefing.Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said the doubts went all the way to the Kremlin.\"It raises questions about naval competence 10 years after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin announced he was going to restore the navy's capabilities, morale and professionalism,\" Schuster said.\"It seems he has not been able to keep any of his promises for any of Russia's military services,\" Schuster said, noting  on land too.But analysts are split on what impact the sinking will have on the Russian invasion.The ISW analysts see it as a relatively minor blow, saying the ship was mostly used for cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian logistic centers and airfields. Russia has land-based systems and strike aircraft that can do the same thing, they said.However, they added that if it was indeed a Ukrainian missile that led to the sinking, the Russian navy would have to rethink its operations, possibly moving ships farther from Ukrainian territory and adjusting their air defenses.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Moskva's main mission was air defense for the Russian forces in the Black Sea.\"It will have an impact on that capability, certainly in the near term,\" Kirby told reporters.Analysts say the sinking will be carefully studied in East Asia, especially if it is confirmed that Ukrainian missiles struck the warship.In particular, analysts will be searching for any insight it might offer into any potential military conflict involving Taiwan-- the democratically ruled island that Beijing's ruling Communist Party claims as part of its territory. Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to gain control of Taiwan and this has caused tensions with the US, which is committed to providing the island with defensive weapons.Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp. think tank, said the strike on the Moskva would underscore to both China and the US \"the vulnerability of surface ships\" in any potential military clash.Heath said in such a scenario the US Navy would want to keep its surface ships well out of range of the anti-ship missiles Beijing has amassed on the Chinese mainland.China, on the other hand, would be aware that Taiwan had been acquiring inexpensive anti-ship missiles similar to those Ukraine claims hit the Moskva, Heath and others said.Because of that, \"any potential (Chinese) invasion of Taiwan remains an extremely high risk mission,\" Heath said.But some analysts said the Moskva's sinking has limited relevance for the situation in East Asia. Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander who is now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, said there were too many differences between the situations.The Moskva's air defense systems are not in the same league as the more modern Aegis systems on US Navy destroyers, and Ukrainian anti-ship missiles are not as good as Chinese ones, Shugart said.And Soviet-era warships like the Moskva have been typically \"known for their offensive punch, not for their defensive systems or their damage control,\" Shugart said.",

        "content": "Chinese officials are grappling with the economic distress caused by their , as several cities remain in lockdown, according to the head of a European trade group.JÃ¶rg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said in an interview with CNN Business on Thursday that his latest conversations with the government had been encouraging as pressure built on Beijing to ease up on measures that have  and kept  at home.\"They are painfully aware of the damage to the economy. They're worried about unemployment. They're worried about foreign companies putting money elsewhere,\" he added, citing a private meeting with a Chinese ministry. He declined to name the agency.China is the world's last major country still adopting a , which aims to stamp out any sign of the virus through stringent quarantine and mobility restrictions. This week, Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to double down on that approach.  \"We must put people and lives first, prevent imported cases and domestic flare-ups, conduct a scientific, precise and dynamic zero policy, and implement all measures to prevent and control\" the pandemic, Xi was quoted as saying Wednesday by state-run news outlet .However, the Chinese leader acknowledged that the country should take measures to minimize the impact \"on economic and social development.\"Analysts have warned of the policy's adverse effects on the world's second largest economy.Last week, the World Bank  China's growth forecast, estimating that Chinese GDP would grow at 5% this year, sharply down from last year's 8.1%. That's also lower than the country's official target of about 5.5%.\"After a promising start to the year, China's economy is now facing its worst disruption since the beginning of the pandemic,\" Carol Liao, China Economist at PIMCO, wrote in a note Wednesday. She added that the impact on growth would ultimately depend on the length of ongoing restrictions.Since last month, full or partial lockdowns have been implemented in about 45 cities, according to  by Nomura. Those cities have around 373 million residents combined, accounting for a quarter of the population and about 40% of the economy. The situation has led to high levels of mental stress. In Shanghai, for example, where a massive lockdown has dragged on for weeks, residents have reported a lack of access to food and basic necessities since authorities decided to extend stay-home measures indefinitely. In a widely publicized letter this week, the European chamber wrote to China's State Council and Vice Premier Hu Chunhuacalling for the government to shift away from the \"zero Covid\" approach and toward Singapore's \"living with Covid\" model.Wuttke said that officials took the recommendation surprisingly \"well,\" and appeared open to further discussion. \"They see the damage it does,\" he added.Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that his current sense was that \"the government is not prepared to change its stance on this.\" Zheng views it as \"more productive\" instead for his organization to stay out of the increasingly politicized debate and focus on more pressing practical matters, such as helping companies try to maintain operations. With the restrictions, logistical matters that had once seemed simple, such as transporting goods from a factory to an airport, had become complex, he noted. \"In a lockdown situation, how do you continue your operations in terms of production, and ... all the challenges with supply chains?\" he said in an interview. \"That's the number one challenge for US companies.\"But for some, it may already be too late.Wuttke estimates that China has already lost 50% of all European expats since the pandemic started. And there could be another exodus of families this summer when the school year ends, according to Wuttke. \"I wouldn't be surprised if another half of [those remaining] leave,\" he said. \"It really depends.\"As other nations continue to reopen, some foreign companies may also consider moving their regional headquarters out of China, he added. \"I definitely see discussions,\" said Wuttke.Among those leaving are diplomats. On Monday, the US State Department  it had \"ordered\" the departure of non-emergency employees and their families from Shanghai, citing \"a surge in Covid-19 cases and the impact of restrictions related to [China's] response.\"The notice came just days after the United States had authorized the \"voluntary departure\" of staff from the city.In Shanghai, \"the mood is really dark,\" said Wuttke. \"Everyone knows that 2022 is going to suck.\"The executive noted that while the international spotlight largely remained on the financial hub, many people throughout the nation had also been struggling.\"I think the situation is much worse in Changchun and Jilin and Shenyang,\" he said, referring to other parts of the country that have endured longer lockdowns than Shanghai. \"These people are equally eager to leave and cannot.\".",

        "content": "I never met them. But on this night, two years since our last Seder, I realize I have missed them. I know that Rudolph and Clara Komerofsky came to this country from Romania in 1902, that they brought almost nothing with them but the candlesticks on the Seder table. I know their descendants -- their faces, anyway, if I struggle to remember their names. One turns her head and I almost mistake her for Arin, Rudolph and Clara's great-granddaughter, and one of my closest friends. But Arin is already at our side, about to introduce us all again.For more than 10 years my wife and I have joined Arin and her family at their Passover Seder. We have shared the table with Arin's parents, Jay and Linda Miller, her grandma Birdie, and dozens of cousins and in-laws and once-removeds. Through our twenties and thirties, we lapsed Catholics have become as accustomed to parsley and salt water, Maror and Charoset as to the incense and Easter ham of our own childhoods.  And through two years of pandemic separation, we have had to settle for our own version of that Passover prayer, So now -- vaccinated, boosted, tested -- we come again to recall the branches of the Komerofsky family, who's from California and who from Columbus, who drinks Manischewitz and who Diet Coke. We know the uncle most eager to tell a new joke and the one who will laugh loudest. I know that Arin's husband, Joe, and I will plot to out-maneuver each other for the last bite of lamb shank. I have come to recognize Rudolph and Clara from the photos in the family Haggadah, and from the stories their descendants tell: their 20th century story, their journey from Romania to the United States, and the ancient one too, the flight from Egypt.  I will never know these ancestors. But throughout the night, I try to imagine them, grateful as I am to them for these friends of ours. Every year on this night different from all other nights, with its questions and responses, I join their descendants in the ancient ritual of the evening meal. After our pandemic separation, I fear I may be a little out of practice. Arin and I met 15 years ago, teaching at an independent Catholic high school on Cleveland's east side. Our friendship took root in our mutual struggles as new teachers, our failures and small, celebrated triumphs. Neither of us -- Arin, a Jewish atheist, nor I, a Catholic agnostic -- ever felt comfortable with the masses, the crossings, the acts of adoration, all the trappings of institutional religion.  What we valued in our -- and each other's -- traditions was the act of gathering around a table, breaking bread and telling stories. That, at least, was a faith we could keep: It brought us to each other's tables again and again, brought Arin and Joe to our doorstep with plates of food when my father died, and us to the Millers' when Grandma Birdie died, at age 96.I don't remember when I first joined in her family's ritual. Or whether I already knew that the Haggadah -- the text recited at the Seder -- required that \"in every generation, it is incumbent on each person to consider him/herself as if s/he had come forth personally from Egypt.\" I certainly did not know how the Komerofsky family understood that traditional injunction, in our own time, in their own words. In the Komerofsky Haggadah (\"slightly rearranged and abridged\"), between the second and third cups of wine, we give thanks for the Komerofsky family. We recite the ancestors' names, Rudolph and Clara, the names of their children and their children's partners, a litany of proper nouns written into the family book for the generations. At my first Seder, the recitation of the Haggadah felt like a script for which I'd forgotten my lines. In those early days I mumbled the Hebrew words for fear of mispronouncing them. I felt I had no right to say \"Next year in Jerusalem,\" even in English. But I could speak the names. As clearly as I could see the photographs in the Haggadah -- here is the whole family gathered around a shuffleboard court in a midcentury basement, here are Rudolph and Clara at their wedding in 1904 -- I could say their names. I could contribute to the embodiment of their memory in our own breath and voice.It was once strange, too, to encounter the ritual within the ritual, as Arin's father, Jay, reads the Haggadah and family members interrupt and interject. \"I thought we cut this part!\" an uncle shouts. \"Are you sure it was 1904?\" asks an aunt. Some of the jokes may be decades old; some of them make the room groan. But then Jay laughs his enormous laugh, and I cannot help laughing, too. This is what I have missed. This is not the rehearsed call and response of the Catholic mass where, at weddings and funerals at least, I still catch myself saying, \"And also with you.\" That cathedral hush is indeed one sort of religious experience.  But the moments when we laugh together -- as if the spirit were upon us, convulsed with joy until we cannot speak -- those must be holy, too. How well we know the Christ who suffered; how I long to know a Christ who laughed.I have heard or read or maybe imagined theologians who say that each of us writes our own gospel with our own life. I admire the idea. But none of my Catholic friends were ever encouraged to add our own words to the logos. One does not riff on the liturgy. Some of us still suspect that God speaks Latin. So it still seems both obvious and wondrous to me, the simple pure act of saying the names. To name, to utter is a holy act in any tradition, especially my adopted tradition as a writer.We say with them \"Max Komerofsky, Ann Abramson, Rose Sacks Mazur, Ethel Abrams, Sophie Goldsmith, Esther Brenner, Birdie Miller Joseph, Rivie Katz.\" I can believe in this, at least: the family -- all our families -- as the center of worship, celebration, consolation. Pious and doubter alike can say the names, keep close the memory or learn the story of the ancestors. We can try at least to live in such a way as to justify their lives and ours. For all I do not know, I have known at least that particular grace of being welcome. One year, when Aunt Rivie, the last of Rudolph and Clara's surviving children, asked me who I'd come with, I told her I was a friend of Arin's. \"Oh, good,\" she said, with what seemed genuine relief. \"You're all right then.\"In my life I've found that blessings, when they come, come this way. Not a laying on of hands but an offhand \"you're all right.\" The way an elder poet once said, when I dropped him off at his hotel after his reading, \"I think our paths may cross again.\" The way my father, when he told me he loved me, added the word \"kid.\"  \"Love you, kid.\" That gesture. A blessing is a sacrifice. Even the lapsed Catholic in me can grasp that.  -- from the Old English -- has to do with shed blood. From the lamb's blood that marks the doorway in Exodus to the open door in this Cleveland suburb where I join my friends in profane solemnity and reverend irreverence.\"Did the candles come from Romania, too?\" an uncle asked one year as Janet, our host, lighted them. \"No,\" Janet smiled.  \"I got them at Drug Mart.\"\"All of our relatives near and far,\" we say, \"and those of generations yet to be.\" I still cannot read the Hebrew, though I can pronounce a few more words and phrases now, enough to join in the speaking of the names, to say my own version of grace. The home the temple, the table the altar, the flame kept as one keeps a faith: day by day and in every generation. \"Next year in Jerusalem,\" I say with them now. I admire this moment of the ritual. But what I love is to trust that next year -- and for as many years as possible -- we will still be here together, far from Egypt and Romania and even Jerusalem, in this suburb on the east side of Cleveland.   It is the best I can hope for my own struggle with faith: the offhand blessing, given without asking. To arrive and to find the door is open. That we are welcome.",

        "content": "New Zealand's top court ruled Wednesday that a murder suspect can be extradited to China to face trial in a landmark decision following a more than decade-long legal battle.Chinese authorities accuse Kyung Yup Kim, a South Korean citizen who has permanent residency in New Zealand, of killing a woman in Shanghai in 2009, according to court documents.  first requested his extradition from New Zealand in 2011, but Kim's lawyers argued he could face torture and would not receive a fair trial under the country's murky judicial system, prompting years of legal wrangling. Like many Western countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, New Zealand does not have an extradition treaty with China.In its decision, New Zealand's Supreme Court ruled by three judges to two that Kim's extradition should proceed. The three judges in favor said they had received sufficient assurances from China and were \"satisfied that there was no real risk Mr. Kim would face an unfair trial.\"Chinese authorities had assured the court that if extradited, Kim would have access to New Zealand consular staff, and be tried and detained in Shanghai rather than sent elsewhere in the country, according to the ruling.The court added it felt confident China would stick to its word, citing \"the strength of (China's) motivation to honor the assurances\" and \"the strength of the bilateral relationship between the two countries.\" Kim's lawyers had argued the high-profile nature of this case and its sensitivity to Chinese authorities put him at high risk. In the Wednesday ruling, the court disagreed, saying he was \"an ordinary criminal suspect\" because he \"does not belong to a minority group and is not a political prisoner.\"In a statement to CNN, Tony Ellis, Kim's lead lawyer, said Kim was \"very disappointed with the judgment.\" The team will fight the extradition by filing a complaint to the UN Human Rights Committee and seek a fresh judicial review if necessary, Ellis said. He cited the more than two years the Supreme Court had taken to reach its decision and Kim's numerous health issues -- including severe depression, a small brain tumor, and liver and kidney diseases -- as grounds to object. After China's initial extradition request in 2011, Kim had been detained for five years then granted bail on the condition he worean ankle bracelet, making him the longest serving detainee without trial in New Zealand's modern history, Ellis said.Kim has lived in New Zealand since he was 14 years old, according to court documents. His mother is also a New Zealand permanent resident, while his father, brother and two children are citizens.The case against him dates back to December 2009, when a young woman who worked as a waitress at a bar was found dead in Shanghai, according to . At the time, Kim was visiting Shanghai and had rented an apartment there.Pieces of a quilt were found on her body -- which were identified by Kim's then-girlfriend as similar to one he owned. When police searched Kim's apartment, they found samples that matched the waitress' DNA.Kim had also told a contact in a telephone conversation that he may have beaten a sex worker to death, according to police.Court documents said there was evidence to suggest the waitress may have engaged in sex work. Kim has denied the murder charges.Following China's initial extradition request, the New Zealand courts ruled in 2013 that Kim could be handed overand that decision was confirmed two years later by the Minister of Justice. However, Kim filed for a judicial review and successfully challenged the decision.After receiving further assurances from China that it would treat Kim humanely, the minister in 2016 decided to recommend Kim's extradition a second time. Kim once again challenged the decision -- first unsuccessfully at the High Court then successfully at the Court of Appeal in 2019.The case then went to the Supreme Court for a final ruling.  the Chinese Foreign Ministry had urged New Zealand to extradite Kim \"as soon as possible, so that justice can be upheld for the victim,\" and defended the Chinese judicial system as respecting \"the legal rights of criminal suspects.\"In China, courts, prosecutors and police are overseen by the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission and its local branches.China's judicial system has a conviction rate of about 99%, according to legal observers. Human rights advocates say unfair trials and the torture and mistreatment of prisoners are common.",

        "content": ".Astronomers have detected a powerful radiowave laser, known as a megamaser, in space. This record-breaking megamaser is the most distant one ever observed at 5 billion light-years away from Earth. The light from this space laser traveled a whopping 36 thousand billion billion miles (58 thousand billion billion kilometers) to reach our planet. An international team of astronomers, led by Marcin Glowacki, observed this light, using the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory's MeerKAT telescope. (MeerKAT is shorthand for Karoo Array Telescope, preceded by the Afrikaans word for \"more.\") Glowacki is a research associate at the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.Megamasers are created when two galaxies crash into each other. It is the first hydroxyl megamaser that MeerKAT has observed, Glowacki said.Hydroxl, a chemical group consisting of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom, can be found inside galaxy mergers. \"When galaxies collide, the gas they contain becomes extremely dense and can trigger concentrated beams of light to shoot out,\" Glowacki said in a statement. The research team has named the laser Nkalakatha, which means \"big boss\" in isiZulu, the Bantu language of the Zulus in South Africa.The astronomers detected the megamaser on the first night of a survey that spanned more than 3,000 hours of observation time using MeerKAT.\"It's impressive that, with just a single night of observations, we've already found a record-breaking megamaser,\" Glowacki said. \"It shows just how good the telescope is.\"The research team is continuing to use MeerKAT to observe narrow areas in the sky closely and search for the same elements spied in the megamaser. Doing so could provide more insight into how the universe has evolved.\"We have follow-up observations of the megamaser planned and hope to make many more discoveries,\" Glowacki said.The MeerKAT telescope, located in the Karoo region of South Africa, includes an array of 64 radio dishes and has been operational since July 2018. The powerful telescope is sensitive to faint radio light.MeerKAT is a precursor to the transcontinental Square Kilometre Array, or SKA, a telescope under construction in both South Africa and Australia.The array will include thousands of dishes and up to 1 million low-frequency antennas in an effort to build the world's largest radio telescope. Despite the fact that these dishes and antennas will be in different parts of the world, together they will create one telescope that has over 1 square kilometer (0.39 square miles) of collecting area. As a result, astronomers can survey the entire sky much more quickly than with other telescopes.",

Over the two-week trial, former hostages testified about the brutal beatings and torture they endured under the three members of the Beatles, who they nicknamed \"John, George and Ringo.\" Elsheikh, according to prosecutors, was \"Ringo.\"Family members of the victims also testified during the trial, including Kassig's father, Edward, as well as Foley's mother and brother, Diane and Michael.  The three Beatles, Mohamed Emwazi, Alexanda Kotey and Elsheikh, would take hostages in order to demand the release of ISIS militants in prison or to collect ransom. Some hostages were released after large ransoms were paid, but others were executed by the group on camera for propaganda films. Kotey pleaded guilty in September and Emwazi, who prosecutors say was responsible for several of the beheadings of hostages, was killed in a drone strike in 2015. \"The evidence demonstrates that they grew up together, radicalized together, fought as high-ranking ISIS fighters together, held hostages together, tortured and terrorized hostages together,\" prosecutor Raj Parekh said Wednesday. \"What these horrific crimes left behind is a legacy of brutal killings and shattered families.\"  A former ISIS member also testified during the trial, telling the jury that Elsheikh, who he identified in the courtroom, was an ISIS fighter and appeared to be a high-ranking member.  Omer Kuzu, 26, left his home in Dallas, Texas, to join ISIS in 2014 and pleaded guilty in 2020 to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. \"He was an important person,\" Kuzu testified, adding that the type of pistol he says Elsheikh carried \"was a symbol of ISIS aristocracy,\" because the pistol, a Glock, was rare and expensive.  Elsheikh's defense has tried to claim that he was a \"simple ISIS fighter,\" and had been mistakenly identified as a member of the notorious Beatles terror cell. ",

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined Republicans in opposing her, effectively torpedoing her nomination.In a statement Friday, Biden touted Barr, who is currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, for his \"strong support from across the political spectrum.\"Barr previously served in the Obama administration as assistant secretary for financial institutions under Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and was instrumental in designing Dodd-Frank, one of the most expansive pieces of consumer protection legislation to come out of the 2008 financial crisis. The banking rule also created the role of vice chair for supervision, the position for which Barr is nominated, as Biden noted in a statement released Friday.\"Barr has spent his career protecting consumers, and during his time at Treasury, played a critical role in creating both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the position for which I am nominating him. He was instrumental in the passage of Dodd-Frank, to ensure a future financial crisis would not create devastating economic hardship for working families,\" Biden said.Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial makeup. Several nominees to the Fed's Board of Governors, including Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed chair and Lael Brainard as vice chair, still await a vote from the Senate Banking Committee later this month. Economists Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook â€” who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board â€” also await Senate approval.Barr's nomination comes at a crucial point for the Fed as it aims to engineer a soft landing for the economy amid the highest inflation in 40 years. Last month the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 as part of a series of moves to tighten the \"easy money\" policy that supported the economy during the worst of the Covid pandemic, and has indicated that it is ready to ramp up rates at a faster pace.",

        "content": "China has begun sending its most advanced fighter aircraft, , to patrol the East and , Chinese state media has reported.Early versions of the J-20 stealth jet used Russian engines -- but those have since been replaced with domestically-produced twin engines. The jets were first shown to the public with the new Chinese engines last year at Airshow China.The deployment is intended to \"better safeguard China's airspace security and maritime interests,\" state-run tabloid reported on Wednesday, citing military experts. Ren Yukun, a spokesperson for the J-20's state-run manufacturer, added that it was a \"training routine\" for the J-20 to begin conducting patrols now that it's equipped with Chinese engines, according to Global Times.The announcement comes just weeks after United States Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, the commander of US Pacific Air Forces, said US F-35s and Chinese J-20s came into close proximity with each other over the East China Sea.The East China Sea and South China Sea have both long been contested regions, with overlapping territorial claims by numerous countries.China claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building up and militarizing its facilities there, turning islands into , and allegedly creating a  that could number in the hundreds of boats.Meanwhile in the East China Sea, China claims sovereignty over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands. In recent years, the US has reiterated its promise to defend the Japanese islands in the event of foreign aggression.Experts say the deployment of the J-20s shows two things: China's increased confidence in its military abilities, and its warning to other countries with a stake in the territorial dispute.With some 200 J-20s reportedly in service, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) \"now has in regular service a fleet of advanced stealth fighters as good as the Americans, who remain the benchmark,\" said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia. He added that China's message to the world is: \"Any foreign military aircraft intruding into China's claimed airspace in the East and South China Sea may now be intercepted by J-20s.\"While such a move would be politically fraught, the J-20's wide radius of action means it could patrol further out to sea, or stay longer in areas like the East China Sea, Layton said. Small formations, such as a handful of jets, could also conduct occasional deep patrols into the South China Sea, land to refuel at one of China's island airbases, then return to the mainland. The PLAAF could even launch missions to overfly any US carrier battle groups that enter the South China Sea.The transition from Russian to Chinese engines also shows China's growing independence in military manufacturing, Layton said. \"It's not just that China does not need Russian help anymore, it is that Chinese-built aircraft are now superior to Russia.\"The fact that the J-20s now have more reliable twin engines than the Russian ones makes these patrols \"a much more plausible option,\" which could be why they hadn't been sent on patrol before, said Layton.The J-20 has long been touted as China's answer to the American F-22 -- considered the world's premier stealth fighter jet -- and the F-35.A 2017 report by the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the new Chinese engines would give the J-20 low supercruise ability, meaning they could fly at supersonic speeds for prolonged periods.US officials have long said the J-20 can't stack up to US stealth fighters -- but Wilsbach, the US Pacific Air Forces commander, said last month that the J-20s made a strong impression when they encountered US F-35s over the East China Sea.\"We're relatively impressed with the command and control that was associated with the J-20s,\" Wilsbach said at a  for Aerospace Studies conference.The US observed \"relatively professional flying\" by the Chinese aviators, he said, but noted the US was unsure how China would employ the J-20s, whether in multi-mission roles like the F-35 or in an air superiority role like the F-22.Layton said the US, Japan and other countries will be \"keenly collecting electronic intelligence data\" on any J-20s out on coastal patrols, hoping to gather more information on its stealth characteristics, as well as any radio and datalink transmissions.",

But arguably more important than any of these is something on which they all rely: the humble truck. Armies need trucks to transport their soldiers to the front lines, to supply those tanks with shells and to deliver those missiles. In short, any army that neglects its trucks does so at its peril.Yet that appears to be exactly the problem Russia's military is facing during its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, according to experts analyzing battlefield images as its forces withdraw from areas near Kyiv to focus on the Donbas.Photographs of damaged Russian trucks, they say, show tell-tale signs of Moscow's logistical struggles and suggest its efforts are being undermined by its reliance on conscripts, widespread corruption and use of civilian vehicles -- not to mention the huge distances involved in resupplying its forces, or Ukraine's own highly-motivated, tactically-adept resistance.  \"Everything that an army needs to do its thing comes from a truck,\" says Trent Telenko, a former quality control auditor for the United States' Defense Contract Management Agency, who is among those parsing the images for clues as to how the war is going.\"The weapon isn't the tank, it's the shell the tank fires. That shell travels by a truck,\" Telenko points out. Food, fuel, medical supplies and even the soldiers themselves -- the presence of all of these rest on logistical supply lines heavily reliant on trucks, he says. And he has reason to believe there's a problem with those supply lines. Telenko describes one recent photo of tire damage on a multimillion-dollar mobile missile truck, a Pantsir S1,as the canary in the coal mine for Russia's logistical efforts. As such an expensive piece of equipment, he would have expected its maintenance to be first-rate. Yet its tires were crumbling just a few weeks into the war -- what Telenko refers to as \"a failure mode.\"If trucks are not moved frequently the rubber in their tires becomes brittle and the tire walls vulnerable to cracks and tears. Telenko says the problem is common when tires are run with low inflation to cope with the sort of muddy conditions that Russian forces are facing in the Ukrainian spring. For Telenko, who for more than a decade specialized in maintenance problems in the US military's truck fleet, the condition of the Pantsir S1 is a revealing mistake.\"If you're not doing (preventive maintenance) for something so important, then it's very clear the entire truck fleet was treated similarly,\" he says.Telenko's theory has echoes of US World War II Gen. Omar Bradley's famous quote that \"amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.\" And he is not the first to have detected a lack of professionalism in Russia's military, which includes hundreds of thousands of conscripts.In one notorious incident early in the war, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, and towed artillery became stalled 19 miles (30 km) outside Kyiv, bogged down according to Britain's Ministry of Defense not only by Ukrainian resistance but \"\" too. Last month,  that Russia had made \"missteps\" and \"struggled with logistics,\" while on Saturday a senior US defense official said the Russians had still not solved \"their logistics and sustainment problems\" and would be unable to reinforce their forces in eastern Ukraine \"with any great speed.\"Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, sees another \"bad sign\" for Russian truck logistics: its use of civilian trucks to replace military ones lost in battle. \"Civilian trucks are not made to military grade. They're not made to carry the loads, they're not made to carry the specific pieces of equipment,\" and in many cases cannot even operate off roads, O'Brien says.The rigors of war are already trying enough for the sturdiest military grade truck, let alone a civilian one. \"A single mile in peacetime, if you drive it in wartime is like 10 or 20 miles(16 to 32 km) because you are pushing the truck hard with huge payloads,\" O'Brien says.Switching between the two introduces a maintenance problem, as spare parts may not be compatible. And, as O'Brien points out, \"You don't want to have to get a new truck every time an old one breaks down.\"Compounding the problem, according to Alex Vershinin, a former US Army officer who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that when vehicles do break down Russia has limited resources to recover them.The Russian army's battalion tactical groups -- those at the spearhead of its advances into Ukraine -- normally have only one light and one heavy recovery vehicle, even in units featuring dozens of vehicles, Vershinin wrote last month for the US Military Academy's Modern War Institute. This means combat vehicles sometimes need to be diverted to towing duties and sometimes broken down \"vehicles need to be towed up to a hundred miles,\" wrote Vershinin.O'Brien suggests Russia has neglected its trucks largely because they are not glitzy enough for a military keen to show off its cutting edge weapons systems.In recent years, Putin has boasted about Russia's hypersonic missiles like the Zircon and Kinzhal, stealth fighter jets like the Su-57, and its modern fleet of 11 ballistic missile submarines.\"Often glamorous dictator militaries are good at the showy weapons, they buy the fancy aircraft and the fancy tanks, but they don't actually buy the less glamorous stuff,\" O'Brien says.At the root of Russia's logistical problems, experts say, are two things that plague its military: conscription and corruption.About 25% of the Russian military's million troops are conscripts, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- though many experts believe that figure may be misleading, suspecting some of the non-conscript troops are either coerced or tricked into enlisting. Russia's conscripts tend to serve one-year stints, occupy the lower ranks, and fill many of the positions in the logistics chain, including vehicle maintenance. \"You can't really learn anything in a year about maintaining military systems,\" Telenko says.Conscripts also have little motivation as they know their time in the job is so limited, he says. A senior US defense official said Wednesday said Washington is seeing morale problems among Russia's conscripts, who make up \"almost half\" of its forces in Ukraine.\"We have evidence, even recent evidence, that they have been disillusioned by this war, weren't properly informed, weren't properly trained, weren't ready, not just physically but weren't ready mentally for what they were about to do,\" the US official said.By contrast, in the US military vehicle maintenance is handled by a volunteer non-commissioned officer corps, professional sergeants and corporals who stay for extended enlistments and are motivated by pay rises and promotions.\"You want to have as good people maintaining logistics as you do for every other branch,\" says O'Brien, at the University of St Andrews. He adds, in reference to Russia's apparent struggles, \"Were they in a shape for a logistics war or did they not just take it seriously?\" Then there is the corruption that experts say has dogged the Russian military for years. Matthew Stephenson, a Harvard Law School professor and editor in chief of the Global Anti-corruption Blog, wrote in March that corruption had a particularly corrosive effect on the Russian military's maintenance and supply logistics.\"All of these problems that anti-corruption experts and national security specialists had been emphasizing for years do seem to be manifesting in the current Russian invasion,\" he wrote.\"Corruption -- in the form of embezzlement or bribery -- can also lead to the purchase of substandard equipment, for example by giving the contract for equipment or maintenance to a less qualified supplier that is more willing to pay kickbacks. Or the person in charge of allocating the maintenance or procurement budget can simply report spending the full budgeted amount on high quality products or services, but then purchase low quality substitutes and pocket the difference.Telenko's view is that some of the effects are now being seen on the battlefield. He says money that should have been used for maintenance is \"likely lining the pockets of officers in charge of the conscripts who would be servicing the trucks.\"There are other, subtler, signs of Russian struggles that might easily be missed by anyone who isn't logistically minded, experts say. For instance, says Alex Lord, Europe and Eurasia analyst at the Sibylline strategic analysis firm in London, Russia's military has historically relied on its large manpower reserves to handle logistics, rather than mechanized systems using wooden pallets and forklifts. Telenko gives the example of loading artillery shells onto a truck. A forklift can lift a pallet of two dozen shells in a single go, while manually lifting individual shells onto a truck would consume far more time and manpower.This makes Russian logistics around 30% less efficient than leading Western militaries, says Jason Crump, CEO of Sibylline and a veteran of 20 years in the British military.\"This means that it takes more trucks to do a given task in the same time, so greater fuel use and wear and tear,\" Crump says.It also means Russian trucks spend more time standing still while loading and unloading, according to Lord.\"This provides opportunities for Ukrainian forces to target them -- as we have seen Ukrainian commanders exploit numerous times during the current campaign,\" he says.All these problems only exacerbate the problems facing Moscow in what is already an uphill struggle for its forces given the distances involved.Trucks can usually operate up to 90 miles (145 kilometers) from their supply depot, Telenko points out.But Ukraine is about the size of Texas, almost 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) wide and 350 miles (563 kilometers) long.That means Russia would need to open numerous supply depots inside Ukraine for its troops to advance farther into Ukraine's interior. With Moscow already pulling back under fierce Ukrainian resistance that seems like a tall order. Russia is already thought to have lost a substantial number of trucks.Building more to replace them could take at least six months, Telenko estimates, by which time more losses would be likely.\"I don't see how the Russians can maintain their current positions, let alone make any offensive moves with their current truck fleet,\" he says.\"Trucks are the backbone of any modern mechanized military force, and if you don't have them you walk.\"And if you walk, you don't win.CNN's Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Four survivors were still hospitalized Thursday, two days  left New Yorkers badly shaken and forced a reckoning over passenger security on thein the country.Mayor Eric Adams is due to hold a virtual news conference Friday to thank frontline workers for their handling of the shooting and its aftermath.In court Thursday, Frank James, 62, was denied bail and did not enter a plea on charges of violating a law that prohibits terrorism and violent attacks on mass transportation. He was arrested a day earlier in Manhattan's East Village after  to police; hours earlier, a teenager had  to report seeing him.Police say James boarded a train during Tuesday morning's rush in Brooklyn, set off smoke grenades and fired a gun 33 times, shooting 10 people.Twenty-nine people were sent to hospitals, including the 10 who were shot and 19 others who suffered injuries mostly related to smoke inhalation, falling down or having a panic attack, officials said. The four people still hospitalized Thursday were in stable condition, according to hospital representatives.While officials have not released a motive for one of the most violent attacks to occur on the city's subway system, they have pointed to  in which James shares his views on violence, mass shootings and mental health. James, who's Black, says in the videos that he suffered from post-traumatic stress and supported hatred of African Americans and other people he believed had maligned him. In a video posted in February, he criticizes a plan by Adams' administration to address , saying it was \"doomed to fail.\"City officials want to enhance security in the subway system, the mayor told CNN on Wednesday, noting the process would entail examining technology that could detect whether somebody is carrying a gun.\"But it is extremely challenging to identify every person that enters the subway system because of the ,\" he said.On the day of the shooting, more than 3 million people rode the system, which also includes passengers who used the Staten Island Railway,  the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. At James' hearing Thursday, Assistant US Attorney Sara Winik described the attack as \"premeditated and carefully planned.\" Prosecutors also argued James was a flight risk and a danger to the community, according to a letter submitted by US Attorney Breon Peace to a federal judge.\"The defendant committed a premediated mass shooting on the New York City subway system and then fled the scene, with a stockpile of ammunition and other dangerous items stowed in his storage unit,\" the letter says.Defense attorney Mia Eisner-Grynberg cautioned against a rush to judgment. \"We are all still learning about what happened on that train,\" she said outside the courthouse. \"What we do know is this: Yesterday, Mr. James saw his photograph on the news. He called Crime Stoppers to help. He told them where he was. Initial press and police reports in cases like this one are often inaccurate. Mr. James is entitled to a fair trial, and we will ensure that he receives one.\"The shooting James is accused of carrying out took place as a train was traveling from the 59th Street station to 36th Street station in Brooklyn just before 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.The suspected shooter was wearing a yellow hard hat, an orange reflective jacket and a surgical mask as he set off at least one smoke device and began shooting at people with a Glock pistol, according to a criminal complaint. Witnesses saw the suspect wearing a gas mask, the complaint stated. the smoke engulfing the train by running to one end of the car. The doors wouldn't open until two minutes later, when the train reached the 36th Street station, and passengers fled the train as the smoke followed them, video shows. Other victims with bloody wounds fell to the platform as they shouted for medical care. Blood streaked the subway platform, with people sitting and lying on the platform, photos taken at the scene show.James was initially named a person of interest after authorities determined he rented a U-Haul van whose keys were found at the scene. Investigators declared him a suspect Wednesday morning after they learned he bought a gun that was left at the scene. Authorities found a bag containing the Glock handgun, a plastic container with gasoline, a torch, the U-Haul key and multiple bank cards, as well as another bag containing fireworks, the complaint states.James bought the gun in Ohio in 2011, the bank cards had James' name on them and the U-Haul key was connected to a van James had rented in Philadelphia, according to the complaint.A neon construction jacket left on the subway platform had a receipt for a storage unit in Philadelphia registered to James, the complaint states.Federal prosecutors believe he went to the storage facility filled with ammunition and weapons the evening before the attack, according to court documents. A search of the unit revealed additional ammunition and \"a threaded 9mm pistol barrel that allows for a silencer or suppressor to be attached.\"Hours before James was arrested, Jack Griffin, 17, said he was on a field trip with his high school photography class when he spotted the suspect sitting on a bench on Manhattan's Lower East Side.Griffin submitted the tip to NYPD's Crime Stoppers around 10:30 a.m. And although James wasn't captured for several more hours, the NYPD later told him the tip helped narrow their net of his whereabouts, he said.\"It's crazy,\" he said. \"I was looking for things to shoot (with a camera), and I found probably one of the most wanted people.\"CNN's Caroll Alvarado, Chris Boyette, Travis Caldwell, Alaa Elassar, Rob Frehse, Jason Hanna, Chris Hippensteel, Artemis Moshtaghian, Paul P.

        "content": "Despite the enticing subtitle \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,\" the second sequel to 's Wizarding World franchise mirrors the first, which is to say that it feels like an extended prologue for a better movie that's yet to materialize. In hindsight, Rowling should have funneled her Harry Potter prequel into a limited series, where leisurely pacing is more the norm.In theory, a \"young Dumbledore\" movie would address some of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" shortcomings, providing a more dynamic anchor than the shy and halting Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). Moreover, Rowling has added more A-list help this time around, teaming not only with director David Yates but co-writer Steve Kloves, another veteran of the Harry Potter franchise.Still, the storyline essentially handcuffs Dumbledore (Jude Law), or at least ties his wand behind his back for too much of the movie, by virtue of his romantic bond with the evil Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen, ably stepping in for ), who -- in classic authoritarian fashion -- intends to take over the magical world and wage war against Muggles. (The references to their past relationship are relatively chaste, but were apparently still .)Because Dumbledore can't directly confront Grindelwald and his minions, he must recruit not only Newt but an eclectic group of wizards and witches, as well as Newt's Muggle pal Jacob (Dan Fogler). But other than Jessica Williams' enhanced role as Eulalie (Lally) Hicks (sporting a '40s gangster accent that takes some getting used to), they're a fairly nondescript bunch.Foremost, the latest \"Fantastic Beasts\" unfolds with no great sense of urgency, sending the gang on a series of adventures and detours building toward an anticipated showdown to thwart Grindelwald's plans.Having played villains in James Bond, Marvel and now Harry Potter movies, Mikkelsen advances his bad-guy Hall of Fame credentials, and when he sneers, \"With or without you, I'll burn down their world,\" he introduces a sense of menace that outshines most everything else in the film.Yet even with that contribution and the characteristically impressive production design and effects, \"Fantastic Beasts\" seldom sparks to life. In hindsight, the real misstep might have come when Warner Bros. (like CNN, part of Warner Bros. Discovery) let Rowling outline , as opposed to at most a more conventional trilogy, although  the fourth and fifth installments could depend on how well \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" performs at the box office.Whatever the commercial verdict, the creative one delivers another mixed bag that tempers enthusiasm for more, barring promises to both pick up the pace and enhance Law's role in a more definitive manner.Otherwise, like  \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" is handsomely done but ultimately too much of a dumble-snore. And somehow, its appealing pieces, old and new, again add up to a less-than-magical movie. ",

The 28-year-old admitted ahead of the Masters earlier this month that he has been dealing with a hand and hip injuries which have affected his play. He explained that he's been dealing with a torn left hip labrum for around two years and injured his hand -- also reaggravating his hip -- when he slipped over on a marble floor while playing table tennis at the  in February. \"That's really when it just got to the point where I couldn't even grip the golf club,\" he said in a press conference ahead of the Masters. \"I tried to play that week, and it was impossible. I was not even gripping with my left hand that week. I was like, 'This is dumb, I have to go take care of my body first and get it right.'\"That's what happened. And went and got a CT scan, MRI, and we found out that -- and X-rays in my left hip, was kind of -- I had a torn labrum, a partial tear.

He has seen his world ranking slip to 19th and said he hopes to be back competing at the \"golf's highest level\" after taking the \"appropriate time needed to rest and recover.\"\"Over the past few months My Team, Dr. Graham, and myself have been monitoring the fracture to the hamate bone in my left wrist,\" he said. \"I made attempts to play through this injury at three recent events, including the Masters, but this is typically an injury that requires surgical treatment.\"Through continued discomfort from the fracture, it has caused me to alter my grip and swing, resulting in my inability to compete at golf's highest level. This has not been easy physically and mentally for me.\"For now, I will be taking the appropriate time needed to rest and recover from this procedure and look forward to competing at the highest level within the next two months.

        "content": ".The host of the Passover seder I'll attend Friday evening will include an orange on the ceremonial plate, as a means of acknowledging gay and lesbian struggles during the holiday that commemorates Jewish people's liberation from bondage in Egypt.The orange is a relatively recent addition to the seder plate. Susannah Heschel, a Jewish studies professor at Dartmouth College and the daughter of the civil rights leader Abraham Joshua Heschel, added the piece of fruit in the early 1980s.\"During the first part of the seder, I asked everyone to take a segment of the orange, make the blessing over fruit, and eat it as a gesture of solidarity with Jewish lesbians and gay men, and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community,\" . \"In addition, each orange segment had a few seeds that had to be spit out -- a gesture of spitting out, repudiating the homophobia that poisons too many Jews.\"The inclusion of the orange, which some use to represent feminism, shines a light on a wider pattern: Over the course of decades, many celebrants have used Passover to signal their support for a variety of freedom struggles -- to ask and answer questions about the world around them and the role they want to play in it.For instance, in April 1969, some 800 people -- Jewish, Christian, Black, White -- joined together in the basement of Lincoln Temple, a Black church in Washington, . The event marked the one year that had passed since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and also underscored Black-Jewish kinship bonds.Still curious about the evolution of Passover, I spoke with Rabbi Sandra Lawson, the director of racial diversity, equity and inclusion at Reconstructing Judaism, and Emily Tamkin, a senior editor at The New Statesman and the author of the forthcoming \"\" (and the host of the seder I'll attend on Friday).Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. There are many people who think that there's a right way to observe any Jewish anything. But the beautiful thing about Judaism is that it's constantly evolving. That's how we survive.Passover, I believe, is probably the most celebrated Jewish holiday because it takes place in the home, where people can infuse their customs, their food, as long as it subscribes to the rules of the holiday. But different customs have interpreted those rules to mean different things. I just wrote a whole book that basically says that there's no one correct way to be Jewish, so it would be the height of hypocrisy for me to go out and say, \"This is how you have to celebrate Passover.\" What I really love about this particular holiday, aside from the story itself, is that, if you want it to be, it's in conversation with the world around you -- because it's a story about overcoming oppression and about freedom and about searching for something better and about solidarity.There's so much there that you can use to explore not only Jewish history but present politics, if you so choose. And I think that if you look back at the last several decades of Jewish American history, you see people doing that. They're bringing older traditions in conversation with their country and with the world and creating new traditions in the process. I told my wife about the 10-minute seder (at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, some of Lawson's students at Elon University, where she previously served as the Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life, created an abbreviated seder so that they could celebrate before leaving campus). We're going to make matzo. We're going to do the 10-minute seder. And we're going to hang out.Like a lot of people, I've had to rethink my own orthodoxy around the holiday. If you had told me three years ago that I would actually be in a plague during a time when we're studying the plague and that I wouldn't be doing the things I normally do on Passover, I would've thought that you were nuts. But the world changed. Making matzo (unleavened bread)has become one of our traditions.There are people who are going to be upset and say, \"You can't make your own matzo.\" I can. That's a beautiful thing about this holiday. It's celebrated in the home, and people have the freedom to observe the holiday however they want to.There are people who say that you can't do stuff. People say that to me because . They say things like, \"You can't be a rabbi if you're Black\" or \"You can't be a rabbi if you're queer\" or \"You can't be a rabbi if you're a woman.\" I am so glad that this year we are hopefully able to celebrate together indoors. The word in Yiddish class that we use for \"pandemic\" is the same word that we use for \"plague.\" So it certainly takes on a new resonance that this is happening now.I also want to say that I celebrate Passover a bit differently now than I did when I was younger. As an adult hosting my own seders, I have an orange on my seder plates. One year, my husband and I used the  (the book or guide read during the seder), which has a prompt about refugees now to talk and think about while you're having your own seder.To me, this is a holiday about knowing who you are and not letting anybody take that away from you, and also extending that same right to everyone. The thing that makes my wife's and my seder plate different is that we have a vegan house. And early on, I was trying to figure out how to make a vegan seder plate and started doing some research. In place of an egg, we slice an avocado. And in place of the shank bone, a roasted beet. I also add an orange to my seder plate to remember and pay homage to the feminist movement.And I haven't done this yet, but I'm thinking about adding a tomato, which can represent farmworkers and highlight the lack of awareness and the lack of pay and the poor conditions for people who pick tomatoes. I'll have an orange on my seder plate to represent solidarity with LGBTQ and other marginalized people. But I understand that some people include it to mean feminism or to mean LGBTQ solidarity  feminism. When preparing for this interview, I saw that some people have suggested that for interfaith families you can have an artichoke on your seder plate. Some people turn to an olive for peace in the Middle East or Palestinian solidarity. There are just so many different things that you can include.But what I want to stress is: More than whatever Haggadah you use, and more than whatever individual symbol you have on your seder plate, the important thing is that you're thinking about what the holiday means -- that you're thinking about what the story meant then and what it means in your own life now.I don't want to tell anybody how to live or be. But, to me, it's important not to get so hung up on any one song or piece of fruit that you lose sight of the fact that questioning and changing and doing things a little differently and deciding what to keep and what to shed are part of the Passover tradition, too.",

        "content": "It's the most egg-cellent time of the year. Along with crocuses and daffodils, fluffy bunnies and chicks and pastel colors popping up everywhere, spring is the season when the sunny spheres of eggs take center stage.While you might be getting your fill of the chocolate egg variety this month -- I'll take mine filled with coconut, thanks -- April is also the time to celebrate the versatility of fresh eggs.Eggs are a nutrient-dense food and \"a perfect way to jump-start your day,\" according to Lisa Steele, fifth-generation chicken keeper, self-described eggs-pert and author of \".\"\"They fill you up, they have some fat in them, they're a complete protein, and they're so versatile,\" she said. One egg contains 6 grams of protein and a host of crucial nutrients such as vitamin B12, riboflavin, choline, biotin and selenium.There's no need to groan at the thought of using up a baker's dozen of hard-boiled eggs after Easter for those who celebrate either. In fact, you don't need to hard-boil eggs before dyeing them. This might not be ideal for anyone hiding eggs for an Easter egg hunt. But for general use, dyed eggs work just as well as au naturel eggs in the following recipes and dishes.No serious examination of this ingredient's versatility can begin without an appreciation of the egg breakfast sandwich. Whether it's on a bagel, crusty roll, English muffin, biscuit or tortilla, a simple scrambled or fried egg is a classic kick-starter for many a morning.But there's more to do with an egg beyond the skillet, and it's OK to take it beyond breakfast, too. Give yourself carte blanche to eat your favorite egg-centric dishes any time of day.For fans of runny yolks,  or muffin tins are much more hands-off than making multiple poached eggs for the family. The basic template is simple: Fill the dish or tin with a combination of meat, vegetables or cheese, then crack in an egg and season with spices and herbs. Bake until the whites are set and the yolks have a bit of jiggle to them.For those who prefer a more scrambled egg, the savory tart and quiche family is where it's at -- with a bonus of baking them in a flaky edible container. Technically, the difference between a tart and a quiche is a matter of depth: Tarts are baked in shallow pans, while quiches are of the deep-dish variety.But whichever you choose, a quiche or a tart is an ideal opportunity to make the most of what's in your fridge. Again, pick a combination of meats, vegetables and cheeses and use an egg custard blended with cream or milk to hold it all together. Try a or a to get started.Love to bake? Now's the time to try your hand at making an egg-enriched bread. French , Jewish , Swiss , Italian  -- many cultures have their own version of a sweet, and often braided, bread. Dairy such as milk or butter is also frequently added to these doughs, making them pull-apart tender.To double your eggy pleasure, slice or cube the bread, and let it sit for a day to go slightly stale. Then turn it into  or a decadent casserole.\"I almost feel like the egg yolk and the egg white are two separate foods,\" Steele said. With different flavors and textures, the yolk and white can be used separately to add richness and structure to a variety of dishes.(From a nutritional perspective, the egg white is mostly all protein, while the yolk contains the essential nutrients, so it's ideal to eat both in some form.)It's easier to separate yolks from whites when eggs are cold, and the simplest way is to do it with your hands. Crack the egg into a bowl, then scoop out the yolk and let the excess whites run through your fingers.For this writer, the most perfect and convenient use of an egg yolk is in . With a ratio of one egg yolk per serving of pasta, it's an ideal way to make a comforting meal for one or two in a pinch.Egg yolks are also the base of the intensely rich custard for , which can be made in the oven or in a . \"It's so fancy, but it's so easy,\" Steele said, and \"you can make it in advance if you have people over.\"Once you've slurped down carbonara and spooned up crÃ¨me brulÃ©e for dessert, you'll have a few leftover egg whites. Leave the virtuous egg white omelets for another day and make something a bit more exciting.The protein-and-water structure of an egg white is what makes it whip into a light and fluffy froth, so use that science to your advantage and make  with just egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar. Or bake  -- you can double your fun and top them with dyed marshmallow spread as frosting if you have a lot of egg whites on hand.\"You can freeze egg whites or put them in the refrigerator if you're going to use them in a day or so,\" Steele said. My strategy for leftover egg whites is to freeze them individually in ice cube trays until needed, so I'll always have the exact amount called for in a recipe. is a food writer, illustrator and photographer; the author of \"Pierogi Love: New Takes on an Old-World Comfort Food\" and \"Classic Snacks Made From Scratch: 70 Homemade Versions of Your Favorite Brand-Name Treats\"; and editor of the website .

Going into the quarterfinal match at the Camp Nou level at 1-1 after the first-leg, Frankfurt at one point found themselves three goals up on the night.Filip KostiÄ‡'s brace and Rafael BorrÃ©'s fine strike put the German side in surprise control and it looked to be coasting to a memorable win until a frantic end to the match. BarÃ§a scored twice in added time, through a magnificent Sergio Busquets goal and a last-second penalty from Memphis Depay, but the Catalan club ran out of time to stage what would have been an astonishing comeback. The result was celebrated by the thousands of Frankfurt faithful who managed to find their way into the stadium. Only 5,000 tickets were officially allocated to the away team, but there seemed to be many more inside the iconic arena with Spanish press reporting at least 20,000 were able to attend the match. Barcelona president Joan Laporta said he was \"ashamed\" that so many Frankfurt fans managed to get in. \"It is a shame we have experienced this here today. It cannot happen again. We have a lot of information about what has happened and we need time to go over it,\" he told BarÃ§a TV.  \"Then we will take measures, we will explain them and it will not happen again ever because it is an outrage.\"It was all looking so good for the . The Catalan club looked to have turned a corner after a difficult start to the season and was enjoying a 15-match unbeaten run. But the La Liga outfit struggled to cope with Frankfurt's lightning-quick counter attacks and will learn a lot from a match which highlighted areas that need quick improvement. BarÃ§a manager Xavi, also frustrated by the number of away fans in the stadium, said his team didn't play well enough across the two legs. \"We were trying for some heroics at the end, but it wasn't enough. We didn't play the best way,\" he told reporters. \"In fact, we weren't good tonight. They played well on the counterattack and although their second was a fantastic goal, it stemmed from a very silly mistake of ours.\"Frankfurt, currently ninth in the Bundesliga, will now play West Ham in the semifinals after the Hammers reached the last four of a European competition for the first time in 46 years.

        "content": "They may be the most famous international superstars you have never heard of, thanks to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis trying to eliminate their very existence.But in the musical \"Harmony,\" which premiered in New York this week, Barry Manilow and his longtime songwriting partner Bruce Sussman are trying to give the six young men of the Comedian Harmonists their rightful place in history by telling their story.It is a project they have been working on for decades, but \"Harmony's\" relevance now is chilling, with war raging in Ukraine and innocent lives being disrupted by hate.\"It sounds very current,\" Manilow said in an interview during a rehearsal last month.\"I think one of the many joys about doing this show now is that it seems to be resonating more than ever,\" Sussman added.\"There are actually moments in the show where I fear that people are going to think I'm writing to the headlines. These things were written, some of them years ago, and it's just now that they seem like they're taken from the front page of the paper or your lead story on CNN,\" he said.Three of the Comedian Harmonists were Jewish, three were gentile. They were shut down by Hitler, their 12 films and many records ordered burned and destroyed. All men scattered and fled, and one of their Jewish wives was taken by the Third Reich and never seen again.But before it got to that, the men, worldwide sensations in the early 1930s, were in New York, playing Carnegie Hall, and had the opportunity to stay in America but decided to return to Germany.The poignancy of these men not being able to imagine a dictator like Hitler could kill innocent people the way he did is a bone chilling parallel to current events, as Vladimir Putin appears to target civilians - children and women - in his own bloodthirsty quest for land and power.When the character known as \"Rabbi,\" played by Chip Zien, belts out a painful line \"Why?\" the audience does not have to be transported back almost a century to connect with the wanton evil. It is happening as we speak in Ukraine.\"It's the same hate, just different uniforms,\" is one of many lines in the musical with that tragically timely meaning.The group was officially shut down by the Nazis not only because some of the members were Jewish, but because the singers were labeled \"degenerate\" and censored, also the kind of tactic one sees today in Putin's Russia.Sussman wrote the lyrics, and Manilow wrote the music. \"It's my proudest moment as a songwriter,\" said Manilow.\"This is what I started off wanting to be. I wanted to be a Broadway songwriter and an arranger of pop music. That was it. And here it is. It's taken a little while longer, a little longer than I thought it would, but this is the kind of Broadway musical that I always wanted to write. It's got every style of music that I have always loved. It's not just one style. You would think, 'Oh, Barry Manilow, it's going to be all ballads.' It's not. Every song is totally different than the one before it,\" Manilow elaborated.\"This is the Barry I want everybody to know about,\" Sussman chimed in.The two have been collaborators for 50 years, writing one of Manilow's most enduring hits together: \"Copacabana.\" \"'Copacabana' was an ice cream sundae. It was frothy, and it was fun to do, and it was stylistic, stylish. It was also a very weird pop song because there was nothing like it on the radio. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it was as successful as it was. This is -- we have to put ourselves into the head of 1920s, 1930s Germany between the wars,\" explained Sussman.\"We talk about the depth of this piece. It's not a serious evening. The first act is as up, and happy, and funny, and full of energy as any Broadway musical that I've ever seen. Just on the second act, it starts to go dark,\" said Manilow. The idea came decades ago after Sussman watched a documentary about the Comedian Harmonists and called Manilow to say he found the musical they should write. Before Manilow became a pop star in the early 1970s with his first hit, \"Mandy,\" the collaborators and friends wanted to be the next Rodgers and Hammerstein. Both native New Yorkers and Jewish, they said they connected with this story immediately.\"We know these people. I mean, there are Jewish characters and gentile characters. We certainly know the Jewish characters. These are people we grew up with. These are people in our family. These were people in our neighborhoods who happened to also be terrifically talented,\" said Sussman.\"We know what means stuff to them. Yeah, it was deep. That part was a deep experience. Bruce had to go way deeper than I did since he's the book writer, the story writer. But I had to do my own work and find melodies that made sense in this world of Germany and Jewish,\" Manilow said.And to those Manilow melodies, the characters sing of impending doom the audience knows is coming: ",

Millions of , disabled, and older Americans are eligible for the treatments, and Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health  that more people may qualify soon.The program allows people with covid symptoms to get tested, be prescribed antiviral pills, and fill the prescription all in one visit. The  and many state and local health departments direct residents to an online  where people can find test-to-treat sites and other pharmacies where they can fill prescriptions.But large swaths of the country had no test-to-treat pharmacies or health centers listed as of April 14. And the website of the largest participant, CVS, has significant technical issues that make booking an appointment difficult.Even people who regularly see a doctor may be unable to get a prescription in time, and that's where the program comes in. Before the pandemic, 28% of Americans  a regular source of medical care, with rates even higher for Black and Hispanic Americans.\"All of our public health response relies on lowering the barrier to getting treatments to the right people,\" said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California-San Francisco.She said the fragmented federal, state, and local public health systems, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' reliance on partners that charge high prices for appointments, and the lack of clear information are stymieing the effort. \"The best tools that we have are not going to reach the people who most need them,\" she said.Bibbins-Domingo is also a practicing physician at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, which she says is not only testing patients for covid and prescribing them antivirals, but also delivering them medications â€” all the elements of test-to-treat. But the hospital, which largely treats low-income and uninsured patients, doesn't appear on the federal map. It shows just three locations in San Francisco: two community health centers and one CVS.Ninety-one percent of the sites listed on the national map are federal partners: pharmacy chains like CVS, federally qualified health centers, and military and Indian Health Service clinics. HHS has asked state and local health departments to identify , like San Francisco General Hospital, so they can be added. Most states have none of those partners listed yet.Nationally, CVS MinuteClinics make up more than half of all test-to-treat locations, according to the federal data. The roughly 1,200 clinics, in 35 states and Washington, D.C., are housed under the same roof as CVS pharmacies, where patients can pick up prescriptions for covid antivirals. Walgreens drugstores and Kroger grocery store affiliates run about 400 more sites.The federal government has set aside nearly 400,000 courses of the antivirals for its federal pharmacy partners â€” about a quarter of the  since the program began in March.Although the cost of the pills is covered by the federal government, obtaining a prescription at the pharmacies that dominate the program can be expensive. Though CVS does not charge symptomatic uninsured people for on-site covid tests, MinuteClinics charge  for in-person or telehealth appointments to examine patients and prescribe an antiviral, if needed. People without insurance, whose health plans don't cover visits to the clinics, or who have high-deductible plans must shoulder the full cost of the appointment.Even if they can afford it, finding treatment might be impossible.KHN aimed to find out how easy or hard booking a test-to-treat appointment at a CVS would be. Reporters searched online and in person for covid testing and treatment appointments in April.It took a KHN reporter in the Washington, D.C., area three hours driving between stores to figure out whether testing was available and antivirals in stock across four MinuteClinic locations â€” time that few people can afford in general, let alone when they're sick.Each store provided test-to-treat services, which could be booked through a kiosk. But three of the stores either didn't have same-day appointments available or didn't have the antiviral pills in stock that day.A KHN reporter also tried to book appointments online at clinics in several states, listing upper respiratory symptoms. After the reporter marked a positive covid test on the screening form, a message appeared â€” \"For the safety of our patients and staff, we can't allow you into the clinic at this time\" â€” and the patient was then directed to book a telehealth visit. KHN also searched CVS' website for testing appointments at all MinuteClinics shown on the federal map in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, just over 100 clinics total. Only half listed any future testing appointments available.Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, said that all MinuteClinics provide in-person test-to-treat services and that a software glitch made it appear they don't. She said CVS is working to fix that. Thibault said covid patients are \"encouraged\" to use telehealth. Some Americans, especially seniors,  the devices, internet connection, or technology skills needed for virtual visits. The program requires participants like CVS to provide options for in-person appointments, said HHS spokesperson Suzanne Sellman.KHN also searched online for appointments at participating Kroger and Walgreens clinics in several states and found many available in-person appointments.Another complication: The FDA requires doctors, advanced practice registered nurses, or physician assistants to write the prescriptions. A pharmacist can't do it. Many of the nation's leading pharmacy organizations have  to remove the restriction, which would expand the program to scores of rural and underserved communities.Because of this rule, the program requires clinics and pharmacies to be under the same roof â€” a setup that  in many regions, particularly in rural areas.The federal map shows no sites in Wyoming or South Dakota other than military clinics, which don't serve the public. People in dozens of other regions would have to drive more than 100 miles to reach the nearest clinic, according to a KHN review of participating locations.The Wyoming Department of Health is working to enroll providers in the program, spokesperson Kim Deti said.Montana has four public-facing test-to-treat clinics, according to the federal website and Jon Ebelt, a spokesperson for Montana's Department of Public Health and Human Services. He said that seven Defense Department and Indian Health Service facilities also provide test-to-treat services, but those aren't open to most people.Billings, the state's most populous city, is more than a three-hour drive from the nearest site shown on the map. Ebelt said the agency is working with a local primary-care nonprofit to find more facilities to enroll.We have to get this right, said Bibbins-Domingo, the San Francisco professor. She said that as the U.S. moves away from restrictions like mask mandates, the public health system must ensure that everyone can get these new treatments, which can get people back to work sooner, prevent serious illnesses, and even save lives.For those far from clinics, people with disabilities, and people too sick to leave home, telehealth could be the easiest way to get treated. A few local governments, including  and , have launched virtual care initiatives.Truepill, a company that provides telehealth and pharmacy technology, offers online covid assessments through its website  for a fraction of the cost of CVS' in-person or telehealth operations. The company has filled more than 10 million prescriptions in the past five years.The service, available in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., costs $25 to $55. Though insurance isn't accepted, the cost is comparable to insurance copays for in-person doctor appointments. Prescriptions can be sent to a local pharmacy for no additional charge or shipped to a home overnight via FedEx for a $20 fee.HHS did not respond to requests for data on antiviral use and has repeatedly declined to allow KHN to observe  about the program held with state health officials, clinic directors, and other health care providers.Bibbins-Domingo said that to be effective, the federal government must make it easier to get testing and treatment, especially when the program is geared toward those at highest risk of devastating complications from covid.\"If you're just an average person trying to navigate this,\" she said, \"it's actually completely impossible.\" KHN correspondents Katheryn Houghton and Rachana Pradhan contributed to this report.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

        "content": "Native American people in Maine have been excluded from protections guaranteed by federal law for more than 40 years but lawmakers could help change it.As the state Legislature's second session reaches its final days, a  to restore  to Maine's tribes is being considered. Earlier this week, dozens of Indigenous advocates, social justice groups and environmentalists marched outside the state capitol building.The bill, , aims to give the , the , the  and the  (formerly known as the Aroostook Band of Micmacs) power to regulate hunting, fishing, natural resources, land use on tribal lands, economic development, among other rights.The state House voted 81-55 to pass the bill on Thursday and now it heads to the Senate. The legislature is scheduled to adjourn its session on Wednesday.Leaders of the Wabanaki nations said they haven't had equal access to many federal programs and have been excluded from new policy involving federally recognized tribesas a result of a decades-old settlement.In the 1970s a years-long legal battle ensued when the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy argued their ancestral lands had been unlawfully relinquished to Massachusetts and then Maine without the approval of the federal government as required by the Nonintercourse Act of 1790. Their claim was considered to cover about two thirds of Maine's land.The dispute was eventually settled in 1980 with the signage of the , which led the federal government to pay $81.5 million to the tribes but made them subject to Maine laws and placed them under the jurisdiction of state courts.\"What was meant to settle a land claim turned into all kinds of jurisdictional provisions,\" Chief Kirk Francis of the Penobscot Nation told CNN.Since the settlement was reached, Francis says, Congress has passed  \"for the benefit of Native Americans that tribes in Maine have not been able to access in a way that other tribes do across the country.\"Those federal laws include the , which amended the Stafford Act to provide federally recognized tribal governments the option to request a major disaster declaration; and the , which includes a provision allowing tribes to employ medical professionals licensed in another state.Francis said the settlement has impacted the daily lives of the Penobscot people in other ways. For example, the tribe currently doesn't have decision power over dam relicensing and wastewater discharge from municipalities and businesses that affect tribal waters, he said.\"It's been very difficult culturally for the tribe over the years to not have a voice,\" said Francis, adding the Penobscot are riverine people, which means the river and its resources are central to their culture.State Rep. Rachel Talbot Ross, the bill's sponsor, has said it's \"absolutely past time\" to restore tribal sovereignty in Maine and \"modernize\" the relationship between the state and the Wabanaki nations.\"Every time a study is conducted on how the tribes fare under the Settlement Act, it's critical conclusion is that the tribes suffer and have been unable to progress at the same rate as most of other tribal nations within this country,\" Talbot Ross said in on the bill in February.While tribal leaders are hopeful state lawmakers may approve the proposed bill during the current session, they have recently faced both support and opposition for legislative changes.Last year, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, vetoed a bill to allow tribal gaming. In her , the governor said the tribes have been \"unfairly excluded\" from operating their own gaming facility, but the bills were not the answer to a complex issue.Jerry Reid, the chief legal counsel to Gov. Mills, testified against L.D. 1626 in a February hearing saying the governor's office was not ready to support the bill as drafted.He said the governor is not \"necessarily opposed to amending\" the settlement act but \"when amendments are being considered, it's critical that we avoid ambiguous language that could lead to future conflict or litigation.\"Spokespeople for Mills did not respond to requests of comment about L.D. 1626, the proposed tribal sovereignty bill.During a House vote on Thursday, state Rep. Lauren Libby criticized the bill saying it could result in conflicting regulations at the state, federal and tribal levels that could lead to years of costly litigation. Numerous Maine communities may likely be impacted by those disputes because unlike other states, Libby said, tribal land is spread throughout the state and not continuous. For Francis, the opposition to the bill is out of \"fear of the unknown and quite frankly, the lack of wanting to give up any control.\" \"This is not the tribes trying to gain any special rights here. We're just in to restore the rights we had,\" he said.In Congress, US Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, recently introduced  that would amend the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 and allow future federal laws to impact the Wabanaki nations. The bill has been referred to the House natural resources subcommittee.\"This bill will cut through unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic efforts to block the Wabanaki tribes from benefiting from future federal laws passed for their benefit, and create opportunities for improved standards of living and economic growth,\" Golden said in a over the bill last month.CNN's Tiffany Anthony contributed to this report.",

        "content": "For 12-year-old Dmytro Keda, after the worst few weeks imaginable, Thursday evening was a dream come true. Keda, who fled his hometown of Mariupol in Ukraine after spending three weeks holed up as Russian forces bombarded the city, came on as a last-minute  in Shakhtar Donetsk's charity friendly  against Poland's Lechia GdaÅ„sk. And in a touching scene, Keda -- having exchanged a few passes with his Shakhtar teammates after coming on -- was put through on goal, slotting home before being mobbed in celebration by players from both teams. Keda was lifted aloft in celebration, with his goal marking the difference in a 3-2 victory for the Ukrainian side. Shakhtar's head coach Roberto De Zerbi  after the match that the decision to let Keda come on and score was \"spontaneous.\" The Ukrainian club's game against Lechia GdaÅ„sk comes as part of the club's 'Global Tour for Peace' which involves playing a number of teams -- including Olympiacos, FenerbahÃ§e and Hajduk Split -- in a series of charity games.As of April 7, over 1.4 billion Ukrainian hryvnia ($47.2 million) had been donated by the foundation set up by Shakhtar owner Rinat Akhmetov and the team to \"help Ukraine and Ukrainians during the 40 days of the war.\" \"This amount includes humanitarian aid to civilians, as well as assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Territorial Defence force in dozens of cities and towns,\" a  on the club website read. Before Thursday's game at the Polsat Plus Arena, the Ukrainian national anthem was played while a minute of silence was observed for the victims of the war.Players from both teams wore shirts with the message \"Stop war\" emblazoned on the front, with the Shakhtar shirts featuring the names of Ukrainian cities affected by the war. De Zerbi said after the victory in the friendly match that \"football is definitely not paramount for us.\"\"We currently travel around Europe as guests and are grateful to everyone who gives us the opportunity to play in different cities,\" the Italian manager said. \"Today, we are in Poland which is closer to Ukraine. Therefore, of course, it was more emotional. We can say that the two peoples are very similar, and that's why people in the stands were more emotional.\"",

They should not be traded like commodities and transferred abroad for processing,\" UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Gillian Triggs said in a statement. \"UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum-seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,\" Triggs said. UNHCR also said that the plan would increase risks and cause refugees to look for alternative routes, putting more pressure on front line states. \"Experience shows that these agreements are eye-wateringly expensive usually. They often violate international law. They don't lead to solutions, rather to widespread detention or to more smuggling,\" UNHCR Senior legal officer Larry Bottinick told British radio station Times Radio on Thursday. Human Rights Watch was fiercely critical of the plan, issuing a strongly-worded .\"Rwanda's appalling human rights record is well documented,\" it said.\"Rwanda has a known track record of extrajudicial killings, suspicious deaths in custody, unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, and abusive prosecutions, particularly targeting critics and dissidents. In fact, the UK directly raised its concerns about respect for human rights with Rwanda, and grants asylum to Rwandans who have fled the country, including four just last year,\" it said, adding, \"At a time when the people of the UK have opened their hearts and homes to Ukrainians, the government is choosing to act with cruelty and rip up their obligations to others fleeing war and persecution.\"Amnesty International UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Director Steve Valdez-Symonds described the plan as \"shockingly ill-conceived.\" \"Sending people to another country -- let alone one with such a dismal human rights record -- for asylum 'processing' is the very height of irresponsibility and shows how far removed from humanity and reality the Government now is on asylum issues,\" Valdez-Symonds said in a . As part of the new plan, the British Royal Navy will take over operational command from Border Force in the English Channel \"with the aim that no boat makes it to the UK undetected,\" Johnson said. It also allows UK authorities to prosecute those who arrive illegally, \"with life sentences for anyone piloting the boats,\" he said. The English Channel, a narrow waterway between Britain and France, is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world's poorest or war-torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain.Last November,in bitterly cold waters off the coast of France after an inflatable boat carrying migrants bound for Britain capsized, in one of the deadliest incidents in the English Channel in recent years.CNN's Kara Fox and Helen Regan contributed to this report.

        "content": ", a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that blankets much of eastern Ukraine, has been the front line of the country's conflict with Russia since 2014.But now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are bracing for an assault even more intense. An  of the territory is expected to define Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, after his forces suffered costly failures in Kyiv, and across central and northern Ukraine.  Russian military convoys and resupplied units moving towards Donbas for a large-scale offensive, and Ukraine's foreign minister has warned the world of an impending battle there that will \"remind you of the Second World War.\" A Russian victory in the region would appall the West but could salvage Putin's war aims, while a defeat could cement his invasion as a historic failure. Either way, it is almost certain to devastate yet more of the Donbas region, a historically and culturally significant place whose proximity to Russia has dictated much of its turbulent existence.Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades.But the waves of conflict there since 2014 have reshaped and wounded its cities, and it is along its line of contact that both the Ukrainian and Russian military are most dug in -- making for a familiar but unpredictable new phase of war.Chimneys, factories and coal fields have dotted the landscape of Donbas for decades, and since its two major cities were founded -- Donetsk by a Welsh ironmaster in 1869, and Luhansk seven decades earlier by a Scottish industrialist -- industry has been the lifeblood of the region.The name Donbas is itself a portmanteau of the Donets Coal Basin, and throughout most of the 20th century it served an outsized role as the industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, pumping out coal in vast quantities. \"The Soviet Union intensively developed the Donbas as an industrial center,\" said Markian Dobczansky, an associate at Harvard University's Ukrainian Research Institute. \"It was a place that set the tempo of Soviet industrialization.\" It was a place, too, of \"extremely high-stakes industrial production, and repression,\" Dobczansky adds. \"Terror was present under Soviet rule. Repression happened all over the Soviet Union, but it happened intensely in the Donbas.\" Suspicion, arrests and show trials were rife.A rise in steel and metal manufacturing, the creation of a railroad and the development of a shipping industry in the port city of Mariupol diversified Donbas beyond its coal mining roots. But in the three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the region's economic might has shriveled. \"In the 1990s, the Donbas saw the floor drop out economically,\" Rory Finnin, associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge, told CNN.A decline in living standards and rampant poverty plagued the region during its initial transition from communism, Finnin said, and Donbas is now often likened to the Rust Belt regions of the United States, where once-thriving heartland locations have struggled to adapt. But an upturn in fortunes followed the turn of the century; Donbas remains Ukraine's industrial epicenter, complimenting the agricultural production of the rest of the country.While prosperity in the region has wavered, one steadfast characteristic of its inhabitants has not. The people of Donbas have and remain \"fiercely independent,\" Finnin said. \"It marches to the beat of its own drum.\"The region's long-standing industrial pull has attracted people from across Eastern Europe over the past century, and it has had strong social and economic ties to neighboring Russia as well as to the rest of Ukraine. Unlike much of central and western Ukraine, which had historically changed hands between various European empires, Donbas spent most of the past millennium under the control of Russia. In the country's only post-Soviet census in 2001, just over a half of the population of Donbas was made up of ethnic Ukrainians and a third of ethnic Russians. Russian is by some distance the most widely spoken language in Donbas, unlike in western Ukraine. But the country as a whole has a tradition of multilingualism and the connection between language and national identity is tenuous there, experts say.The cities of Donbas lie \"far away from the metropolitan centers, (and) far away from the big cities\" in central and western Ukraine, said Dobczansky. \"People could flee to the Donbas and get lost.\" Western-influenced, pro-European politics has typically not been embraced in Donbas as it has in the west of Ukraine.That sense of disconnect from the capital Kyiv and other metropolitan centers has given rise to a vast collection of local movements, and was the backdrop upon which pro-Russian separatists attempted to seize control following Moscow's annexation of Crimea.But Finnin and others warn \"it's important not to fall to notions that the Donbas is pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian,\" a concept that has been stirred up relentlessly by the Kremlin since 2014 but is roundly debunked by experts.In an exclusive CNN poll conducted by Savanta/ComRes shortly before Russia's invasion began, people in the easternmost region of Ukraine, which includes Donbas, mostly rejected the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are \"one people,\" and comprehensively disagreed that the two states should become one country. Fewer than one in five people there felt that way, compared to about a third of Russians who did, demonstrating the lack of desire to change national allegiance despite the region's longstanding cultural connections with Russia.\"(Pro-Russian) separatism prior to 2014 was a distinctly minority position,\" and no organized movement existed, Dobczansky said. Opinion polls -- and the region's own vote for independence in Ukraine's 1991 referendum -- affirmed Donbas' desire to leave Soviet-era allegiances behind. \"People would have a very strong sense of being a coal miner, or a metal worker, or being in the proletariat,\" he added. \"People (also) had a sense of being a part of the Ukrainian republic, but the idea was that the Donbas transcended national identities.\"Despite its move into independence along with the rest of Ukraine in 1991, Donbas has maintained a place in the psyche of Russian leadership.A famous Soviet propaganda  from 1921 dubbed Donbas \"the heart of Russia,\" depicting the region as a beating organ with vessels stretching across the Russian empire. Before then, the region was part of the concept of \"Novorossiya,\" or New Russia, a term given to territories towards the west of which the Russian empire had expansionist ideas. Cities like Luhansk and Donetsk are historically \"places that (Russians) could see a certain version of themselves,\" Finnin said. And that historical image could still persist inside Putin's own worldview, experts suggest.Observers have often suggested that Putin's desired endgame is to rebuild the Soviet Union in which he first rose up the ranks. Anna Makanju, former director for Russia at the US National Security Council, that Putin \"believes he is like the czars,\"the imperial dynasties that ruled Russia for centuries, \"potentially called by God in order to control and restore the glory of the Russian empire.\"But such a project could not be attempted without an effort to recapture Donbas, given its emotional resonance as the Russian empire's industrial backbone. \"It's symbolically very important; the Donbas supplied the entire Soviet Union with raw materials,\" Dobczansky said. It is in that context that Putin has refocused his stuttering invasion on the region where his conflict with Ukraine began eight years ago. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin has refocused his war strategy on achieving , Russia's \"Victory Day\" that marks the Nazi surrender in World War II. \"There's every possibility that Putin will move now to effectively bisect Ukraine; that will give him enough to be able to declare a victory domestically, and allay his critics that this has been a botched invasion,\" said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015.\"Taking the Donbas (would be) a consolation prize, because Kyiv is now out of Russia's military grasp, but it's a good consolation prize,\" Puri said.Putin's annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas by Russian-backed rebels in 2014 brought to a crashing halt a period of increasing prosperity in the region.War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.The  became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People's Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, temporarily Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics have not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria, and the Ukrainian government has steadfastly refused to talk directly with the leaders of either.But on the ground, living amid conflict became a way of life. \"Eastern Ukraine residents were living in a twilight zone -- they were in the front line of a geopolitical despite, and there was a sense of powerlessness,\" said Puri, who spent time on each side of the line of contact while observing the ceasefire.More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014, including 3,000 civilians caught up in the conflict. Ukraine says that since 2014, almost 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with over half of the registered internally displaced persons staying in the areas of Donbas that remained under Ukrainian control and about 160,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region. Russia has meanwhile aggressively attempted to stir up separatist feeling in the region, which it has then pointed to as a justification for invading. Russian passports were offered to residents from 2019, and Kremlin messaging both in Russia and in separatist-held parts of Donbas has heavily played up notions of ethnic Russians being targeted.\"In propaganda since 2014, the Donbas has become a sacrificial lamb in Russian narratives,\" Dobczansky said.\"It's the place where the Russians have cultivated a cult of victimhood. They've managed to turn their own fomenting of a war into a narrative of victimhood at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,\" he added. \"They hammer this point home.\"That pretext ultimately led to Putin, two days before he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, declaring the Donetsk and Luhansk regions independent in an opening salvo to his war on the country.Whether the battle for Donbas will be the final chapter of Russia's war, or merely its next phase, remains to be seen. But by zeroing in on the region, Putin has brought his assault on Ukraine full circle.\"The Donbas was the frontline for eight years, so the military positions on both sides are extraordinarily well-fortified,\" Dobczansky said.The secessionist conflict in Donbas has been costly but stagnant since the initial surges of pro-Russian forces in 2014; the lines of the conflict have barely moved in several years, with trenches running along the point of contact from the southern coast to the Ukrainian-Russian border north of Luhansk.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier this month that \"the battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations, maneuvers, involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, (and) artillery.\"\"This will not be a local operation based on what we see in Russia's preparations,\" Kuleba said at a news conference in Brussels.The terrain and climate of the region does not contrast dramatically with the rest of Ukraine, but conflict there contains its own unique features. \"It's going to be very different to what people have been seeing in Kyiv and Mariupol,\" Puri said. \"The Ukrainian frontline mixes urban and rural territory ... some of the urban territories that Ukraine (will be defending) were already devastated in eight years of shell fire.\"Already, populous cities like Mariupol have been decimated by Russian bombardments. A similar fate is likely for other urban centers in Donbas, and evacuations have been urged from those in the path of expected Russian advances.Now Russia will likely attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east and can attack from northern cities where they have amassed troops, like Izium, as well as from the south and east. A battle for control of Sloviansk has been anticipated, given its strategically significant position in the path of a potential Russian land corridor. Being closer to Russia and Crimea may also ease some of the supply issues that blighted Russia's doomed assaults on central Ukraine. As Russian columns head towards Donbas, they will no doubt encounter Ukrainian forces that have intimate knowledge of the towns and cities they have been defending for nearly a decade. Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhny, and much of the army's top guard have on-the-ground experience fighting in the region after 2014, and several Ukrainian officials have described the battle for Donbas as the pivotal next phase of the war.\"It's more comfortable, militarily, for the Russians to fight a war in the Donbas than it was in Kyiv, Sumy, or Kharkiv,\" said Dobczansky. \"But it's also the place where the Ukrainian army's most experienced and fortified units are located ... so they'll face the most severe resistance.\"",
