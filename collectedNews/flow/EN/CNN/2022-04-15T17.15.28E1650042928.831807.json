        "content": "This story contains graphic imagery.Indiscriminate  attempting to flee the violence. Victims found with their  behind their backs. An attack on a , a  turned shelter bombed. The list of atrocities and apparent war crimes allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine gets longer by the day. As Ukrainians reclaim areas previously occupied by invading Russian troops, evidence of the horrors of recent weeks is emerging from the rubble of shattered villages and towns. New victims are discovered on a daily basis. And those lucky enough to have survived the ordeal tell harrowing tales of kidnappings, rapes and torture. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said Monday that her office is investigating 5,800 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with \"more and more\" proceedings opening every day. Russia has denied allegations of war crimes and claims its forces do not target civilians. But CNN journalists on the ground in Ukraine have seen firsthand evidence of atrocities at multiple locations across the country. Here is what we saw.Novyi and Staryi Bykiv are two tiny specks on the map, separated by a small stream. Together they form a sleepy community of about 2,000 people that you'd expect few Ukrainians -- let alone the Russian army -- to be familiar with.Katerina Andrusha told me that's why her daughter Victoria decided to leave her apartment in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary and come back here at the start of the war; she believed it would be safer at home.But on February 27, residents say Russian forces rolled into the neighboring villages, turned the local school into their base, vandalized and looted homes and terrorized the people here for five weeks.On March 25, Katerina said Russian soldiers came to her home and took Victoria, claiming she had information about their forces on her phone.Three days later, Katerina herself was taken captive. She said she was held in a cellar for three days. Blindfolded and terrified, she tried to find out what had happened to her daughter.\"They told me she was in a warm house and that she was working with them and would be home soon,\" said Katerina.She said she hasn't seen Victoria since. As she spoke to us, Katerina's gaze drifted skyward in disbelief. She showed us pictures of her daughter, a beautiful schoolteacher.\"We hope that she will get in touch with someone, somewhere,\" she said.Just a few streets away, we met another mother. Olga Yavon's grief was raw and all-consuming. She knew why we were there and the moment she came out to greet us, she broke down in tears.Her boys, Igor, 32, and Oleg, 33, are among six of the village's young men who authorities say were executed by Russian soldiers on February 27.She told us Russian forces rounded them up after a bridge nearby was blown up.The Russians kept hold of their bodies for nine days before dumping them on the outskirts of the village, with instructions to bury them quickly, she said.\"They were very good boys,\" Olga said. \"How I want to see them again.\"I have seen a lot of awful things in my career, but some of the things we were confronted with on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian troops were beaten back by Ukrainian forces have been among the most harrowing. In the suburb of Bucha we were among the first to reach a  that residents dug while the place was under Russian occupation, because so many residents had been killed and longer burial ceremonies would have been too dangerous amid the shooting and shelling.We saw half-buried bodies, legs and arms sticking out of the earth. We met  here; he broke down and could not stop crying. The neighbor who comforted him was also in tears. These moments of heartbreak are difficult to witness -- they make you want to cry as well.Also in Bucha, we were led into a  -- the Ukrainians say the men had been executed by Russian troops. Some had their hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head or the heart.You could still see the horror on their faces. It seemed like the dead wanted the truth of their violent death to be uncovered.No matter how many bodies you see, you never forget a single one.At 10:30 a.m. last Friday as many as 4,000 people in and around the  were waiting to be evacuated when a missile exploded overhead, raining down chunks of metal. Shrapnel ripped through the crowd, which was largely composed of women, children and the elderly. The latest death toll is more than 50, with more than 100 injured. When we , we found the concourse still stained with blood, littered with the scattered possessions of the dead and wounded. On one platform, we found a large pool of congealed blood in a shrapnel impact point with several false teeth nearby. Someone, probably an elderly person, must have been hit and killed there. City officials believe Kramatorsk could be surrounded, besieged and pulverized by Russian forces if and when the much-anticipated offensive in the east gathers pace. The mayor had been urging residents to leave, and prior to Friday's strike around 8,000 people a day were boarding westbound trains. The evacuation effort had been publicly announced, with people from surrounding towns and villages urged to gather at the railway station in Kramatorsk, which was the major regional hub. There was nothing secret about it.  Russia has , claiming the missile -- a Tochka-U -- is no longer used by Russian forces, and alleging that it was a Ukrainian missile that hit the station. Military analysts dismiss the claim.Part of the missile crashed into a small park in front of the station. Someone, somewhere wrote on it in Russian \"for the children.\"While tagging and writing slogans on missiles, bombs and shells is a very old tradition, it is not for certain what the intended message was.  The worst thing I have seen since arriving in Kyiv nearly a month ago would have to be the body of a man we were shown in a , northwest of Kyiv.We were led to the site by the owner of the house, who had fled town in the first few days of war. She returned as the invading troops withdrew, only to find her home had been ransacked by Russian soldiers. Behind her garden shed, she showed us a man, with a bag over his head, his hands tied behind his back and his trousers pulled down, exposing his underwear and heavily bruised leg. He had a gunshot wound to the head, and a single bullet case was still lying next to his body.He appeared to have been tortured and executed by Russian soldiers, although we do not know for sure what happened to him.By this time, we had already seen the now infamous mass grave in Bucha, but the image of that man has stuck with me -- I find the individual more relatable than the collective. It is easier to compartmentalize, to dissociate a group from the humanity they were robbed of.I keep thinking about that man and who he might have been. Did he suffer? Did he have a family? What were his ambitions? What led him to that backyard? Did he fight back, did he protest against the Russian occupation? What if it had been me — or my brother, who was living in Kyiv when the invasion started?This man is one atrocity too many. And then you realize there are countless others, still waiting to be found, underneath some rubble, in a shallow grave or in someone else's backyard.",

        "content": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken told European allies that the United States believes  could last through the end of 2022, two European officials told CNN, as US and European officials have increasingly assessed that there is no short-term end in sight to the conflict.Many of the officials who spoke with CNN stressed that it is hard to predict exactly how long the war could go on, but several officials said that there are no indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ultimate goals have changed, and it is unlikely he will pursue diplomatic negotiations unless faced with military defeat. The thinking that this could be a long-term conflict represents a marked shift from the early days of the war, when Russia was expected to quickly take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, and underscores Moscow's failures on the battlefield.The longer the war goes on, the more brutal the humanitarian toll on the people of Ukraine. And while officials stressed there is likely to be continued international resolve to provide high levels of support to Ukraine, they acknowledged there may be very real practical challenges regarding weaponry that will need to be dealt with as the war wages on.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday that the fighting in Ukraine is likely to be \"protracted,\" and will go on \"for months or even longer.\"Some members of Congress and their aides are quietly making comparison to the Korean War, which lasted for three years. Two other European officials said they believe that fighting in eastern Ukraine -- where Russian forces are  -- could last for four to six months and then result in a stalemate.Blinken, a senior State Department official said, \"has discussed with his counterparts our concern that the conflict could be protracted, but all of his engagements have revolved around how best to bring it to a halt as quickly as possible.\"British Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said this week that the launch of the new Russian fighting in the Donbas could be weeks away, telling reporters that \"there is a window of opportunity and I think this is why the nature of our support is so important, that we are providing weapons, the equipment that Ukrainians need to do the job they need to do.\"There is growing public acknowledgment of the ties between Ukraine's success on the battlefield and any hope of a diplomatic resolution to the conflict -- a notion that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba addressed outright at last week's NATO Foreign Ministerial. \"It is clear that the positions of delegations in talks will be defined by the successes of relevant armies and the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia,\" he said. US officials cast the additional military support to Ukraine this week as a continuation, but do say that part of what has prompted the doubling down -- and additional support -- is the Ukrainians' battlefield efforts. A second senior State Department official said that \"we have done a lot and so we do have faith and we always had faith in our Ukrainian partners. But as the fight doubles down, so does our commitment to give them weapons and equipment that they can use,\" adding that the Ukrainians have used certain weapons systems \"to great effect.\" Blinken, in a statement Thursday about the new , said the US is \"focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible negotiating position by continuing to provide security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself and by increasing pressure on Putin by imposing severe costs on Russia.\" \"We think that (the Russians) really have the motivation only when they understand that they are facing a strategic defeat,\" Estonian Ambassador to the US Kristjan Prikk told CNN. \"As long as it's seeming they still have the same objectives in mind that they had in the beginning of the war, which is basically destroying the Ukrainian state and to have a complete surrender by Ukrainians, it's difficult to see them really being becoming serious about negotiations.\"Prikk said there are discussions underway about how to better coordinate security aid so that Ukraine has the weapons it needs at the moment it needs them, and noted that there are \"practical challenges\" regarding availability of weaponry. Such challenges were raised by other European officials who spoke with CNN, and State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday \"there are practical challenges that come with this, supply chain supplies, other elements of it.\"\"Those are things that we are working through,\" he said at a State Department briefing. The Pentagon this week hosted the CEOs of the military's eight largest contractors to discuss more rapid arms production. Officials also acknowledge that the public may grow weary for continued support for Ukraine, and will have to be reminded that inaction would be even more costly. \"You can't defend democracy for free. It just doesn't work like that,\" said Cleverly. \"The very visible cost is in human lives. We have discussed the number of people that have been killed and injured during this conflict, but it has a financial cost and you know -- we will be paying that through increased gas prices, we'll be paying that through general inflation as kind of the ripple effects of this kind of washes across the world, and people won't like that. And it's quite understandable that people won't like that, but they should also recognize that not acting would come at a much, much, much, much greater cost.\"There are also always risks that divisions in the transatlantic alliance could emerge the longer the war wages on, a European official said. However, they and others said that the atrocities Russia is committing in Ukraine are likely to play a role in keeping up international resolve in making sure Russia cannot win.\"I think the world has continued to be shocked by the level of atrocity, the level of violence, the level of brutality, that Russia's forces have engaged in against the Ukrainian people. I think that will necessarily maintain this level of consensus within the international community,\" Price said.\"There is no sense that these countries are preparing to move on, to look the other way, and in fact, every time we gather, there is renewed horror, there is renewed condemnation, there is renewed determination to continue to see to it that our Ukrainian partners have what they need,\" he said, adding, \"At a political level, at a strategic level, there's been no indication that we've seen that the focus, the determination, the perseverance will diminish over time.\"",

        "content": "In a wooded area on the Polish side of the  border, men dressed in crisp, clean, camouflage are given tourniquets. They kneel on the muddy ground and start to learn basic survival training.They call themselves the Pohonia Battalion, a group of fewer than 30 Belarusian exiles living mostly in Poland and other countries across Europe, who hope to join hundreds of their compatriots already involved in the battle for Ukraine. The aspiring volunteer fighters say that in order to free their country of Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip, he must first be defeated in Ukraine.The group, whose ages range from 19 to 60, carry Kalashnikov replicas. Almost none have fighting experience. Among them is a professional poker player, a rock musician and an electrician. They are led by dissident and restaurateur Vadim Prokopiev. \"We see a window of opportunity,\" Prokopiev told CNN on Monday.\"I made the call for Belarusians to join the battle for Ukraine because that's step one before step two, which is the battle for Belarus.\"Most of the members, including Prokopiev, were forced to flee their country in 2020, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko -- a Kremlin-backed, Putin ally -- cracked down on a mass protest movement after he claimed victory in a widely disputed election, which was marred by fraud.\"If Ukraine loses this war, Belarus will have zero chance to get free,\" Prokopiev said. \"If Ukraine wins this war that means Putin's hands are too busy and he's too weakened and he won't be supporting Lukashenko with resources.\"  Pohonia wants to join the , a military unit made up of foreign volunteers, but at the time of writing they have yet to be admitted. Hundreds of other Belarusian volunteers are already on the ground fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. Four have been killed since the start of the war, said Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.\"The people of Belarus understand that the fate of Belarus depends on the fate of Ukraine and now it's very important to make Ukraine free for it to be easier to get rid of Lukashenko's regime on our soil,\" Tikhanovskaya told CNN on Wednesday.Moscow uses Minsk as a satellite base for its unprovoked war on Ukraine. At the start of the conflict, Putin ordered troops into Ukraine through the Russian and Belarusian borders.Belarus has been used as a springboard for many of Russia's air operations in Ukraine, according to intelligence collected by NATO surveillance planes.And the Ukrainian military says it has shot down several missiles fired towards its territory from Belarus.After Russia failed to gain the ground it wanted around Kyiv, forces retreated back into Belarus to regroup and redeploy. And NATO fears the Kremlin may even call on Lukashenko to deploy his army to bolster Moscow's forces on the battlefield. It's a prospect that would see Belarusian exiles and Minsk's army on opposite sides of the frontline. The Biden administration has punished Minsk with sanctions targeting Belarusian defense firms, the country's defense minister and has suspended normal trade relations with the country.But Lukashenko has shown no remorse for his role as a facilitator. \"We didn't start this war, our conscience is clear. I'm glad it started,\" he told reporters in March. And earlier this week, Putin thanked Lukashenko for his unwavering support, saying, \"We never had any doubts that if somebody was to offer their shoulder to us, it would be Belarus.\"   Belarus's resistance, fractured and frail since the 2020 crackdown, said volunteer fighters are part of wider efforts to destabilize the Lukashenko regime.\"All those Belarusians fighters are real heroes,\" Tikhanovskaya said of the volunteers. \"Now they are defending Ukraine and maybe one day they could defend Belarus as well,\" she said, referencing the opposition's wish to see Lukashenko's regime overthrown.In Belarus, a railway line used by Russian forces to ferry supplies into Ukraine was partially severed by activists in April when Belarusian police opened fire and arrested three men calling it an act of terrorism, according to Belarus state news agency Belta. And cyber activists recently hacked Belarusian state institutions involved in the war against Ukraine and continue to fight Russian disinformation online, Tikhanovskaya said. But these small measures have yet to pose any real threat to the 28-year rule of Lukashenko, who is often referred to as Europe's last dictator.\"A long journey starts somewhere so we build a small force to build a bigger force,\" Prokopiev said. The exiles now hope that ​Lukashenko's reliance on Moscow ties his future to Putin, and the outcome of what, so far, is a faltering military invasion of Ukraine.",

        "content": "In the weeks between the 2020 election and the , almost of then-President Donald Trump reveal an aggressive attempt to lobby, encourage and eventually warn the White House over its efforts to overturn the election, according to messages obtained by the House select committee and reviewed by CNN. The texts, which have not been previously reported, were sent by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The text exchanges show that both members of Congress initially supported legal challenges to the election but ultimately came to sour on the effort and the tactics deployed by Trump and his team.   \"We're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic,\" Roy texted Meadows on January 1. That text was first  by the House select committee and described as being written by a House Freedom Caucus member. Roy's authorship has not been previously reported. When situated in the overall timeline of events between the election and January 6, the series of texts from Lee and Roy provide new details about how two Trump allies went from fierce advocates of the former President's  to disheartened bystanders. By January 3, Lee was texting Meadows that the effort \"could all backfire badly.\" But shortly after the election, both men were encouraging Trump to keep fighting.  In a series of texts to Meadows on November 7, Lee offered his \"unequivocal support for you to exhaust every legal and constitutional remedy at your disposal to restore Americans faith in our elections.\"Lee went on: \"This fight is about the fundamental fairness and integrity of our election system. The nation is depending upon your continued resolve. Stay strong and keep fighting Mr. President.\"Also on November 7, Roy wrote to Meadows, \"We need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend.\"In a statement to CNN, Lee's communications director, Lee Lonsberry, said, \"I'd like to highlight that Senator Lee has been fully transparent,\" pointing to how Lee had called for an investigation into claims of fraud in the 2020 election but ultimately recognized Biden as president-elect and voted to certify the electoral results on January 6. Roy Communications Director Nate Madden told CNN the text messages \"speak for themselves.\"An attorney for Meadows did not respond to CNN's request for comment.A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment.A source familiar with the committee's work tells CNN that Lee's texts \"reflect he was a cheerleader before he was against it. He uses legal language to push blatant conspiracy theorists into the Trump orbit.\"Over a few days in November, Lee lobbied Meadows to get attorney \"Sydney Powell is saying that she needs to get in to see the president, but she's being kept away from him,\" Lee wrote to Meadows on November 7. \"Apparently she has a strategy to keep things alive and put several states back in play. Can you help get her in?\"Lee then sent Meadows Powell's cell number and her email.  On November 9, Lee again pressed Meadows about Powell, calling her a \"straight shooter.\" That same day, Roy warned Meadows about Trump's approach, texting him, \"We must urge the President to tone down the rhetoric, and approach the legal challenge firmly, intelligently and effectively without resorting to throwing wild desperate haymakers or whipping his base into a conspiracy frenzy.\"Then came the  on November 19, where members of Trump's legal team -- including Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- laid out a series of false claims and conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud.   The messages started to take on a more critical tone. \"Hey brother - we need substance or people are going to break,\" Roy texted on November 19, a few hours after the news conference wrapped.  Two hours later, Lee texted Meadows with serious concerns, saying he was \"worried about the Powell press conference.\" Lee told Meadows, \"The potential defamation liability for the president is significant here.\"For the campaign and for the president personally.\"Unless Powell can back up everything she said, which I kind of doubt she can.\"Meadows responded, \"I agree. Very concerned.\"The news conference came as  in his effort to challenge the results in key swing states. By late November, Lee had shifted away from Powell and started promoting , who a federal judge in California said last month may have been planning a crime with Trump as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election, calling it \"a coup in search of a legal theory.\"Privately Roy was also texting Meadows with support for Eastman, and criticizing Giuliani.\"Have you talked to John Eastman?\" Roy texted on November 22. \"Get Eastman to file in front of pa board of elections...\"Get data in front of public domain.\"Frigging rudy needs to hush.\"   By December, both Republican lawmakers express grave concerns to Meadows about the plan to challenge the certification of the election on January 6. On December 16, Lee asked Meadows for guidance: \"If you want senators to object, we need to hear from you on that ideally getting some guidance on what arguments to raise.\"I think we're now passed the point where we can expect anyone will do it without some direction and a strong evidentiary argument.\" On December 31 Roy expressed even more concern in a text to Meadows. \"The president should call everyone off. It's the only path. If we substitute the will of states through electors with a vote by congress every 4 years... we have destroyed the electoral college... Respectfully,\" Roy wrote.By this time, Trump and his allies were working behind the scenes to enlist portions of the federal government in the effort to overturn the election. That included urging Justice Department officials, including then-Attorney General William Barr, to investigate fraud even after the agency had declared there was none. Trump was also putting heavy pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election on January 6. In a January 3 text to Meadows, Lee argued that Trump's effort to have states send alternate slates of electors to Congress was not legitimate. \"I only know that this will end badly for the President unless we have the Constitution on our side,\" Lee texted in a note to Meadows. \"And unless these states submit new slates of Trump electors pursuant to state law, we do not,\" Lee wrote to Meadows. As CNN has previously reported, the plan to replace authentic electors with fake ones in a handful of swing states was orchestrated by allies of the former President and overseen by his then-attorney Giuliani.  None of those alternate slates of pro-Trump electors received sign-off from state officials or were put before Congress.  While Lee and Roy both voted to certify the electoral results in favor of Biden, more than 100 of their GOP colleagues in both the House and Senate did not. Chief among them were Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, both of whom Lee called out in his texts to Meadows. \"I have grave concerns with the way my friend Ted is going about this effort,\" Lee wrote to Meadows. \"This will not inure to the benefit of the president.\"Lee added that unless new, competing slates of electors were put forward in accordance with state law, the net effect \"could help people like Ted and Josh to the detriment of DJT.\"When January 6 finally came, neither Lee nor Roy joined their colleagues in objecting to the 2020 presidential election results.  After the violence unfolded and Congress returned to session, Roy said on the House floor, \"The President should never have spun up certain Americans to believe something that simply cannot be.\"  He also texted Meadows, \"This is a sh*tshow.\"Fix this now.\"  ",

        "content": "The Russian  rests deep beneath the Black Sea this morning.Whether it lies there as the victim of Ukrainian missiles, Russian incompetence, bad luck or a combination of all three is unclear. What is certain, though, is that the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years will raise troubling questions not only for Moscow, but for military planners around the world.The ship sank off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday.Russia's Defense Ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship's stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles and that these sparked the fire that detonated the ammunition.US and Western defense officials seem to favor the Ukrainian account.The US believes with \"medium confidence\" that Ukraine's version of events is accurate, a source familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror on May 2, 1982, during the Falkland Islands war.The General Belgrano and the Moskva were of similar size -- each about 600 feet (182 meters) long and displacing 12,000 tons -- though the crew of about 1,100 aboard the General Belgrano was more than double the size of the Moskva's crew of about 500.Russia has not disclosed the number of casualties occurred during the Moskva's fire and subsequent sinking. A total of 323 crew died when the General Belgrano went down.The biggest effect may be on Russian morale. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war. Though Moscow carefully manages news about the war in Russia, it will be hard to hide the sudden absence of such a large ship. And its loss will raise doubts about Russia's warfighting abilities, whether it was due to enemy action or accident.\"Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies -- either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship,\" analysts Mason Clark, Kateryna Stepanenko, and George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War wrote in their daily war briefing.Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said the doubts went all the way to the Kremlin.\"It raises questions about naval competence 10 years after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin announced he was going to restore the navy's capabilities, morale and professionalism,\" Schuster said.\"It seems he has not been able to keep any of his promises for any of Russia's military services,\" Schuster said, noting  on land too.But analysts are split on what impact the sinking will have on the Russian invasion.The ISW analysts see it as a relatively minor blow, saying the ship was mostly used for cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian logistic centers and airfields. Russia has land-based systems and strike aircraft that can do the same thing, they said.However, they added that if it was indeed a Ukrainian missile that led to the sinking, the Russian navy would have to rethink its operations, possibly moving ships farther from Ukrainian territory and adjusting their air defenses.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Moskva's main mission was air defense for the Russian forces in the Black Sea.\"It will have an impact on that capability, certainly in the near term,\" Kirby told reporters.Analysts say the sinking will be carefully studied in East Asia, especially if it is confirmed that Ukrainian missiles struck the warship.In particular, analysts will be searching for any insight it might offer into any potential military conflict involving Taiwan-- the democratically ruled island that Beijing's ruling Communist Party claims as part of its territory. Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to gain control of Taiwan and this has caused tensions with the US, which is committed to providing the island with defensive weapons.Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp. think tank, said the strike on the Moskva would underscore to both China and the US \"the vulnerability of surface ships\" in any potential military clash.Heath said in such a scenario the US Navy would want to keep its surface ships well out of range of the anti-ship missiles Beijing has amassed on the Chinese mainland.China, on the other hand, would be aware that Taiwan had been acquiring inexpensive anti-ship missiles similar to those Ukraine claims hit the Moskva, Heath and others said.Because of that, \"any potential (Chinese) invasion of Taiwan remains an extremely high risk mission,\" Heath said.But some analysts said the Moskva's sinking has limited relevance for the situation in East Asia. Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander who is now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, said there were too many differences between the situations.The Moskva's air defense systems are not in the same league as the more modern Aegis systems on US Navy destroyers, and Ukrainian anti-ship missiles are not as good as Chinese ones, Shugart said.And Soviet-era warships like the Moskva have been typically \"known for their offensive punch, not for their defensive systems or their damage control,\" Shugart said.",

        "content": "Across China, cities are locking down their residents, supply lines are rupturing, and officials are scrambling to secure the movement of basic goods -- as its  threatens to spiral into a national crisis of the government's own making.At least 44 Chinese cities are under either a full or partial lockdown as authorities persist in trying to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, according to a report from investment bank Nomura and CNN's own reporting as of Thursday. In Shanghai, the , scenes once unimaginable for the hyper-modern financial capital have become part of the daily struggle for 25 million people. There, residents  the confines of their apartments or housing blocks for weeks have been desperate for food and freedom -- some seen in social media clips screaming out of their windows in frustration or clashing with hazmat-clad workers. Even after the release of a tentative plan Monday for the partial relaxation of measures, there appears to be no end in sight.The current situation may mark the most significant challenge for the country -- and, arguably, for Chinese leader Xi Jinping -- since the initial outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan over two years ago. And for Xi, it comes at a particularly sensitive time, months before his expected step into a  in power at the twice-a-decade Party Congress this fall.The stakes are high for the leader -- China's most powerful in decades -- as he has placed his personal stamp firmly on the  driving these unbending measures, where even a small number of cases can spark sweeping disease controls. \"We need to overcome paralysis in the face of risk, war-weariness, leaving things to chance and becoming relaxed,\" state media reported Xi saying Wednesday, calling on the nation to \"strictly implement normalized prevention and control measures.\" In China, the local officials rolling out Covid-19 measures, like those in Shanghai, typically get blamed for mismanagement when there are problems -- a more acceptable target than the central government and its policies, in the country's tightly controlled political environment. And it's not expected that a Covid crisis will imperil Xi's likely third term. But as the outbreak enters a critical phase -- with some  and a top national health official warning Tuesday that Shanghai's outbreak had \"not been effectively contained\" -- China's ruling Communist Party and its leader will have to grapple with the economic fallout and the growing possibility that, like the virus,  seen in Shanghai could spread. Xi has ordered local officials to do all they can to stop the virus, while also minimizing the \"impact on economic and social development\" -- an order that, counter-intuitively, is expected to push local officials to clamp down with harsh measures at the sign of a few cases, or even preemptively, in the wake of the crisis in Shanghai.\"Shanghai officials were trying to thread this needle they've been asked to thread, which is, 'let's maintain zero-Covid, while also not disrupting anybody's life.' They focused a little bit more on the 'not disrupting people's lives' (side). And they failed,\" said Trey McArver, partner and co-founder at the China policy research group Trivium.\"The lesson that everybody's going to learn is that, actually, you really have to focus on the zero-Covid part,\" he said.As of Tuesday, health authorities said more than 320,000 local Covid-19 cases had been reported across 31 provinces, including those in Shanghai, since March 1. Already dozens of cities have some form of lockdown, even though the vast majority of those total cases have been found in Shanghai and the northeastern province of Jilin. Getting supplies across the country has become a steep challenge, with some expressways closed, and truck drivers ensnared in quarantine or at thousands of highway hevalth checkpoints. Some cities have discouraged their residents from leaving, like the major southern port of Guangzhou, which requires its 18 million people to show a negative Covid test if they want to get out. \"You could basically say the whole country now is like a large number of isolated islands,\" said , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.The situation has spurred various ministries in Beijing into action, with a National Development and Reform Commission official pledging Tuesday to \"actively coordinate with local governments\" and \"employ big data\" to ensure essentials get delivered. Meanwhile, health officials and state media have amped up public messaging on why China must stick to the policy, citing the risks, especially to its , of a widespread outbreak in the country of 1.4 billion. Those health concerns come alongside a \"hidden\" political calculation of the costs of a large-scale outbreak, according to Huang.\"(Beijing is) considering the perceived impact on political and social economic stability, considering the impact on the leadership transition ahead of the Party Congress, and considering the regime legitimacy -- there is a lot at stake,\" said Huang. But the risks for the Communist Party of keeping the policy, which has sparked mounting frustration and anger in Shanghai and threatens more disruption, is also clear -- especially as the country is over 88% vaccinated and most cases, authorities say, remain mild.\"Economic slowdown is quite a big concern,\" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor in the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore.\"The central government always utilizes so-called economic performance to enhance their legitimacy. So how are they going to (explain) sluggish economic performance? I don't know. But one thing is very sure, people will be suffering.\"With Xi's name so closely associated with the policies, the leader has linked himself to their success.\"When you've so clearly centralized power in one person's hands, then I think you can plausibly lay any problems at that person's feet -- so it obviously reflects poorly on him,\" said McArver.But as for whether this would imperil the leader's third term, \"the answer is no,\" he said, pointing to what observers of China's opaque elite politics widely believe to be a void of any real competition for the top role. Meanwhile, it's possible that even from the depths of the current challenge -- if they can find a way to bring the outbreaks largely under control -- the central government could spin a political win, akin to what they did in Wuhan in 2020, analysts say.Then, there was significant anger against the government, for example following the death of the , but China's Communist Party emerged from the crisis to paint its stringent control strategy as an . There has been clear frustration against the government this time around, spilling onto social media this week as users adopted pro-China, trending hashtags en masse to make veiled or sarcastic comments against the government -- before being censored.But there are also ready scapegoats across the country in the form of local government officials, who are under enormous pressure and can be blamed for failures in the implementation of the \"zero-Covid\" policy, shifting fault away from the central government's policy itself, experts say. Many cadres have been fired or demoted throughout the pandemic, including recently in Shanghai, with details typically reported by state media.\"The Chinese central government is very, very careful and also very, very smart in turning the anger on the local governments instead of themselves,\" said Wu.And in a political environment where all dissent is quashed, the narrative of Xi's Party will dominate.However, some argue that China has painted itself into a corner where it now needs to uphold its stringent policy, after reveling for two years in the success of \"zero-Covid,\" while scaremongering about the virus and generating broad support for the policy.Huang puts it this way: \"We should never underestimate the government capacity to redefine its narrative to sustain the public support. And we should never underestimate the people's tolerance, even for policies that harm their interest.\"CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

        "content": ", a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region that blankets much of eastern Ukraine, has been the front line of the country's conflict with Russia since 2014.But now its people, already scarred by eight years of fighting, are bracing for an assault even more intense. An  of the territory is expected to define Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, after his forces suffered costly failures in Kyiv, and across central and northern Ukraine.  Russian military convoys and resupplied units moving towards Donbas for a large-scale offensive, and Ukraine's foreign minister has warned the world of an impending battle there that will \"remind you of the Second World War.\" A Russian victory in the region would appall the West but could salvage Putin's war aims, while a defeat could cement his invasion as a historic failure. Either way, it is almost certain to devastate yet more of the Donbas region, a historically and culturally significant place whose proximity to Russia has dictated much of its turbulent existence.Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades.But the waves of conflict there since 2014 have reshaped and wounded its cities, and it is along its line of contact that both the Ukrainian and Russian military are most dug in -- making for a familiar but unpredictable new phase of war.Chimneys, factories and coal fields have dotted the landscape of Donbas for decades, and since its two major cities were founded -- Donetsk by a Welsh ironmaster in 1869, and Luhansk seven decades earlier by a Scottish industrialist -- industry has been the lifeblood of the region.The name Donbas is itself a portmanteau of the Donets Coal Basin, and throughout most of the 20th century it served an outsized role as the industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, pumping out coal in vast quantities. \"The Soviet Union intensively developed the Donbas as an industrial center,\" said Markian Dobczansky, an associate at Harvard University's Ukrainian Research Institute. \"It was a place that set the tempo of Soviet industrialization.\" It was a place, too, of \"extremely high-stakes industrial production, and repression,\" Dobczansky adds. \"Terror was present under Soviet rule. Repression happened all over the Soviet Union, but it happened intensely in the Donbas.\" Suspicion, arrests and show trials were rife.A rise in steel and metal manufacturing, the creation of a railroad and the development of a shipping industry in the port city of Mariupol diversified Donbas beyond its coal mining roots. But in the three decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, the region's economic might has shriveled. \"In the 1990s, the Donbas saw the floor drop out economically,\" Rory Finnin, associate professor of Ukrainian studies at the University of Cambridge, told CNN.A decline in living standards and rampant poverty plagued the region during its initial transition from communism, Finnin said, and Donbas is now often likened to the Rust Belt regions of the United States, where once-thriving heartland locations have struggled to adapt. But an upturn in fortunes followed the turn of the century; Donbas remains Ukraine's industrial epicenter, complimenting the agricultural production of the rest of the country.While prosperity in the region has wavered, one steadfast characteristic of its inhabitants has not. The people of Donbas have and remain \"fiercely independent,\" Finnin said. \"It marches to the beat of its own drum.\"The region's long-standing industrial pull has attracted people from across Eastern Europe over the past century, and it has had strong social and economic ties to neighboring Russia as well as to the rest of Ukraine. Unlike much of central and western Ukraine, which had historically changed hands between various European empires, Donbas spent most of the past millennium under the control of Russia. In the country's only post-Soviet census in 2001, just over a half of the population of Donbas was made up of ethnic Ukrainians and a third of ethnic Russians. Russian is by some distance the most widely spoken language in Donbas, unlike in western Ukraine. But the country as a whole has a tradition of multilingualism and the connection between language and national identity is tenuous there, experts say.The cities of Donbas lie \"far away from the metropolitan centers, (and) far away from the big cities\" in central and western Ukraine, said Dobczansky. \"People could flee to the Donbas and get lost.\" Western-influenced, pro-European politics has typically not been embraced in Donbas as it has in the west of Ukraine.That sense of disconnect from the capital Kyiv and other metropolitan centers has given rise to a vast collection of local movements, and was the backdrop upon which pro-Russian separatists attempted to seize control following Moscow's annexation of Crimea.But Finnin and others warn \"it's important not to fall to notions that the Donbas is pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian,\" a concept that has been stirred up relentlessly by the Kremlin since 2014 but is roundly debunked by experts.In an exclusive CNN poll conducted by Savanta/ComRes shortly before Russia's invasion began, people in the easternmost region of Ukraine, which includes Donbas, mostly rejected the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are \"one people,\" and comprehensively disagreed that the two states should become one country. Fewer than one in five people there felt that way, compared to about a third of Russians who did, demonstrating the lack of desire to change national allegiance despite the region's longstanding cultural connections with Russia.\"(Pro-Russian) separatism prior to 2014 was a distinctly minority position,\" and no organized movement existed, Dobczansky said. Opinion polls -- and the region's own vote for independence in Ukraine's 1991 referendum -- affirmed Donbas' desire to leave Soviet-era allegiances behind. \"People would have a very strong sense of being a coal miner, or a metal worker, or being in the proletariat,\" he added. \"People (also) had a sense of being a part of the Ukrainian republic, but the idea was that the Donbas transcended national identities.\"Despite its move into independence along with the rest of Ukraine in 1991, Donbas has maintained a place in the psyche of Russian leadership.A famous Soviet propaganda  from 1921 dubbed Donbas \"the heart of Russia,\" depicting the region as a beating organ with vessels stretching across the Russian empire. Before then, the region was part of the concept of \"Novorossiya,\" or New Russia, a term given to territories towards the west of which the Russian empire had expansionist ideas. Cities like Luhansk and Donetsk are historically \"places that (Russians) could see a certain version of themselves,\" Finnin said. And that historical image could still persist inside Putin's own worldview, experts suggest.Observers have often suggested that Putin's desired endgame is to rebuild the Soviet Union in which he first rose up the ranks. Anna Makanju, former director for Russia at the US National Security Council, that Putin \"believes he is like the czars,\"the imperial dynasties that ruled Russia for centuries, \"potentially called by God in order to control and restore the glory of the Russian empire.\"But such a project could not be attempted without an effort to recapture Donbas, given its emotional resonance as the Russian empire's industrial backbone. \"It's symbolically very important; the Donbas supplied the entire Soviet Union with raw materials,\" Dobczansky said. It is in that context that Putin has refocused his stuttering invasion on the region where his conflict with Ukraine began eight years ago. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin has refocused his war strategy on achieving , Russia's \"Victory Day\" that marks the Nazi surrender in World War II. \"There's every possibility that Putin will move now to effectively bisect Ukraine; that will give him enough to be able to declare a victory domestically, and allay his critics that this has been a botched invasion,\" said Samir Puri, a senior fellow in urban security and hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), who worked as a ceasefire observer in Donbas between 2014 and 2015.\"Taking the Donbas (would be) a consolation prize, because Kyiv is now out of Russia's military grasp, but it's a good consolation prize,\" Puri said.Putin's annexation of Crimea and the occupation of parts of Donbas by Russian-backed rebels in 2014 brought to a crashing halt a period of increasing prosperity in the region.War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.The  became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People's Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, temporarily Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics have not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria, and the Ukrainian government has steadfastly refused to talk directly with the leaders of either.But on the ground, living amid conflict became a way of life. \"Eastern Ukraine residents were living in a twilight zone -- they were in the front line of a geopolitical despite, and there was a sense of powerlessness,\" said Puri, who spent time on each side of the line of contact while observing the ceasefire.More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014, including 3,000 civilians caught up in the conflict. Ukraine says that since 2014, almost 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with over half of the registered internally displaced persons staying in the areas of Donbas that remained under Ukrainian control and about 160,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region. Russia has meanwhile aggressively attempted to stir up separatist feeling in the region, which it has then pointed to as a justification for invading. Russian passports were offered to residents from 2019, and Kremlin messaging both in Russia and in separatist-held parts of Donbas has heavily played up notions of ethnic Russians being targeted.\"In propaganda since 2014, the Donbas has become a sacrificial lamb in Russian narratives,\" Dobczansky said.\"It's the place where the Russians have cultivated a cult of victimhood. They've managed to turn their own fomenting of a war into a narrative of victimhood at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,\" he added. \"They hammer this point home.\"That pretext ultimately led to Putin, two days before he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, declaring the Donetsk and Luhansk regions independent in an opening salvo to his war on the country.Whether the battle for Donbas will be the final chapter of Russia's war, or merely its next phase, remains to be seen. But by zeroing in on the region, Putin has brought his assault on Ukraine full circle.\"The Donbas was the frontline for eight years, so the military positions on both sides are extraordinarily well-fortified,\" Dobczansky said.The secessionist conflict in Donbas has been costly but stagnant since the initial surges of pro-Russian forces in 2014; the lines of the conflict have barely moved in several years, with trenches running along the point of contact from the southern coast to the Ukrainian-Russian border north of Luhansk.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier this month that \"the battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations, maneuvers, involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, (and) artillery.\"\"This will not be a local operation based on what we see in Russia's preparations,\" Kuleba said at a news conference in Brussels.The terrain and climate of the region does not contrast dramatically with the rest of Ukraine, but conflict there contains its own unique features. \"It's going to be very different to what people have been seeing in Kyiv and Mariupol,\" Puri said. \"The Ukrainian frontline mixes urban and rural territory ... some of the urban territories that Ukraine (will be defending) were already devastated in eight years of shell fire.\"Already, populous cities like Mariupol have been decimated by Russian bombardments. A similar fate is likely for other urban centers in Donbas, and evacuations have been urged from those in the path of expected Russian advances.Now Russia will likely attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east and can attack from northern cities where they have amassed troops, like Izium, as well as from the south and east. A battle for control of Sloviansk has been anticipated, given its strategically significant position in the path of a potential Russian land corridor. Being closer to Russia and Crimea may also ease some of the supply issues that blighted Russia's doomed assaults on central Ukraine. As Russian columns head towards Donbas, they will no doubt encounter Ukrainian forces that have intimate knowledge of the towns and cities they have been defending for nearly a decade. Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhny, and much of the army's top guard have on-the-ground experience fighting in the region after 2014, and several Ukrainian officials have described the battle for Donbas as the pivotal next phase of the war.\"It's more comfortable, militarily, for the Russians to fight a war in the Donbas than it was in Kyiv, Sumy, or Kharkiv,\" said Dobczansky. \"But it's also the place where the Ukrainian army's most experienced and fortified units are located ... so they'll face the most severe resistance.\"",
