        "content": "More than 14 months after leaving office -- and while still contesting the 2020 election -- former President Donald Trump has seen his net worth soar to $3 billion, according to brand new .When Trump ran for president in 2016, his . That number declined steadily during his time in office, all the way down to $2.1 billion in 2020. His wealth rose marginally, to $2.4 billion, in 2021, his first year out of office.What accounts for Trump's wealth surge? According to Forbes, it was the launch of Truth Social, the social media company being cast as a conservative alternative to Twitter. :What's remarkable about that fact is that, by almost any independent measure,. Two top executives left their posts recently,, and the app has  from the Apple app store. (I have been waiting for six weeks to be admitted to the app.)None of that appears to matter to investors. Nor does the fact, apparently, that Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that is set to take Truth Social public, is  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in the stock have jumped from $10 to more than $56 as of the market close on Monday.Trump has spent much of his life -- and his presidency -- exaggerating his wealth.In a \"Summary of Net Worth as of June 30, 2014\" that Trump released when he announced his presidential bid in 2015, Trump claimed to be worth $8.7 billion. \"I'm really rich,\" Trump said at his campaign announcement that year. \"I have total net worth of $8.73 billion. I'm not doing that to brag. I'm doing that to show that's the kind of thinking our country needs.\"A month after that initial assessment, the Trump campaign put out a release had already risen substantially.\"Real estate values in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and many other places where he owns property have gone up considerably during this period of time,\" claimed the release. \"His debt is a very small percentage of value, and at very low interest rates. As of this date, Mr. Trump's net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.\" (The ALL CAPS were in the original release because, well, it's Trump.)Trump's actual net worth in 2015 was $4.1 billion, according to Forbes.Trump also spent his presidency bemoaning the fact that being president was costing him money. \"I said to one of my friends, a very wealthy friend, I said, 'You know, I'll bet you it cost me $2 or 3 billion and it's worth every penny of it,'\" . \"I don't need the money and it's worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country.\"Pinpointing Trump's exact wealth is extremely difficult due, in large part, to the fact that he refused to release any of his tax returns either while he was running for president or during his four years in office. Trump insisted that tax returns did a poor job of cataloging a person's wealth, which is, um, not true.Trump's recent financial gains come at a fortuitous time for him. The New York Times reported in 2020 that . Last month, Trump  on Trump Tower with a $100 million loan. According to Forbes, Trump is now the .",

This indictment is a result of our collaboration with the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force, and critically, assistance from the brave witnesses and victims who came forward to stand up against hate.\"Six victims were injured, including bleeding cuts and bruises to their faces, and one victim was knocked unconscious and treated for a concussion, according to prosecutors.The victims ranged in age from 19 to 57, according to police information just after the attacks. At least two were treated at a hospital, according to police. No statements were made before the attacks, and there was no prior interaction between the victims and the assailant, police said.Hate crimes against Asians increased so much during the Covid-19 pandemic that the New York Police Department created an Asian Hate Crime Task Force.

        "content": "JetBlue Tuesday made an unsolicited $3.6 billion offer for low-fare rival Spirit Airlines in an attempt to derail a  between Spirit and Frontier Airlines.JetBlue's cash offer is about 33% more than the value of Frontier's stock-and-cash offer for Spirit. Such a transaction would stop a combined Frontier and Spirit from leapfrogging JetBlue to become the nation's fifth largest airlines behind the four airlines —  ,  ,   and   — that among them carry more than 80% of the nation's air traffic.\"The combination of the two airlines would position JetBlue as the most compelling national low-fare challenger to the four large dominant US carriers by accelerating JetBlue's growth,\" said JetBlue in its statement.Spirit said that it \"will work with its financial and legal advisors to evaluate JetBlue's proposal and pursue the course of action it determines to be in the best interests of Spirit and its stockholders.\"For its part, Frontier defended its offer as the superior deal for passengers and shareholders.\"A combined Spirit and Frontier will deliver $1 billion in annual savings for consumers and offer even more ultra-low fares to more places nationwide, creating America's most competitive ultra-low fare airline,\" Frontier said, adding that the combination would provide \"shareholders with substantial upside potential for the combined company as a result of the merger synergies.\"Both Spirit and Frontier operate as what is known in the industry as ultra-low cost carriers, with very low base fares and extra charges for just about anything else a passenger needs, including even carry-on baggage. They depend much more on bargain-hunting leisure travelers, and they carry  fewer business travelers than their larger rivals. As business travel has rebounded from the pandemic much more slowly than , Spirit and Frontier have rebounded faster than their larger rivals.While passengers may like the low fares Spirit and Frontier offer, they have generally given the airlines poor customer satisfaction grades.Spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints in 2021, with 11.5 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to stats kept by the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.4, but that was down 43% from a year earlier. Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.8. IN 2020, Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints when it recorded 49.3 complaints per 100,000 customers. Frontier and Spirit also had the industry's  for 2021, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, while JetBlue was tied for the third best rating on that index.\"Customers shouldn't have to choose between a low fare and a great experience, and JetBlue has shown it's possible to have both,\" said Robin Hayes, JetBlue CEO.The US airline industry has been reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years. The four largest airlines today were formed from a  among 10 airlines. If either JetBlue or Frontier end up with Spirit, it would be the United States' first airline merger since  in 2016.However, the Biden administration has taken a much harder line on theantitrust implications of corporate mergers and the need to protect competition in order to benefit consumers. It has even  between JetBlue and American that allows the airlines to book passengers onto each other's flights, even though that is not a full merger. Frontier played to that issue, saying that since only 18% of the routes flown by Frontier or Spirit are flown by both carriers, its deal would be far better for airline competition. It argued a JetBlue-Spirit combination would reduce competition and result in higher fares.\"It is surprising that JetBlue would consider such a merger at this time given that the Department of Justice is currently suing to block their pending alliance with American Airlines,\" said Frontier.Shares of JetBlue,   and   were all slightly lower in after-hours trading following the announcement.",

Some suffered injuries from his rape.Indonesian officials, including the country's child protection minister, had also backed calls for the death penalty, though the nation's human rights commission, which opposes the death penalty, said it was not appropriate.Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority country, has tens of thousands of Islamic boarding schools and other religious schools that often provide the only way for the children of poorer families to get an education.",

        "content": "Ukrainian President  accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians \"just for their pleasure\" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself.Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of , where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend.On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of , describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC.The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: \"Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council.\"Zelensky added: \"It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively.\"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter.  What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?\" he asked. At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had \"more than doubled\" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17.In Bucha,  and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18.In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was \"not a single crime\" that the Russians \"would not commit,\" alleging that Russian troops had \"searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country.\"\"They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,\" Zelensky said. \"I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,\" he told the UNSC. \"Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,\" he continued. \"Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.\"Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given \"criminal orders\" and \"carried out them by killing our people\" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial. Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed \"all the signs\" that civilians were \"directly targeted and directly killed.\"  In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were \"very disturbing developments.\"  She specifically referenced the \"disturbing\" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.  \"We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,\" Throssell continued. As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have \"exact information\" to share regarding the situation on the ground. Throssell also paid tribute to the \"crucial role\" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the \"multiple teams\" involved in \"reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.\" Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military \"ungrounded.\"  \"We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,\" Nebenzia said in translated remarks.The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine \"failed to materialize.\"Nebenzia also repeated past claims that \"a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military\" continue to proliferate.Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia \"came to ... Ukraine\" to bring peace, not to \"conquer lands.\"Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only \"groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show\" and \"a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.\"CNN's Niamh Kennedy, Laura Ly and Anna Chernova contributed to this report.

        "content": "At the start of 2022,  looked set to be one of the country's most watched political races in decades. An incumbent president standing for election for only the second time in his life; a candidate twice convicted of inciting racist and religious hatred polling in second place; another hard-right stalwart in third and the long-dominant left of French politics in disarray. Then Russia invaded Ukraine.  With Europe's eyes fixed firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin's bloody war, priorities have quickly shifted: Ammunition stockpiles, high stakes diplomacy and even the threat of a nuclear strike have all entered the national debate. Campaigning has been disrupted by the crisis, and several key candidates have had to backtrack on their past support for Putin.Burnished by his experience on the world stage, most polling suggests that incumbent  is likely to come out on top.But with just days to go before the election, his closest rival  is rising in the polls, suggesting the vote could be more tightly fought than the last time the pair went head-to-head in 2017.France hasn't reelected a sitting president for 20 years, diplomacy has trumped campaigning in the president's agenda and with the conflict fueling a cost of living crisis, French voters aren't facing the election many expected. Here's what you need to know. To elect their new president, French voters will likely head to the polls twice. The first vote, on Sunday April 10, sets 12 candidates against each other. These candidates qualified for the race by securing endorsements from 500 mayors and/or local councilors from across the country.If no candidate wins 50% of votes in the first round, the two contenders with the most votes will proceed to a run-off two weeks later, on Sunday April 24. Of the 12 candidates in the race,  that only five have ever garnered more than 10% of voters' support. A second round of voting is almost guaranteed. This also isn't the only national vote France faces this year -- parliamentary elections will take place in June.First-term President Emmanuel Macron has only ever stood in one election -- his successful 2017 presidential run -- and has had a mixed record coming into 2022. Considering that no sitting French president has won re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002, his is a tough spot to be in, though he is the favorite. An ex-investment banker and alumnus of some of France's most elite schools, Macron stirred up nationwide anger with a diesel tax early in his presidency, setting off the yellow vests movement -- one of the most prolonged protests the country has seen for decades.\"The popularity rating today is important,\" political commentator Jean-Michel Aphatie told CNN. \"The level of hatred towards Emmanuel Macron is considerable and shared.\"Internationally, his attempts to , prevent the  and his unsuccessful  were arguably failures. But Macron's full-throated backing of an ambitious and autonomous European Union has won him respect abroad and established his geopolitical credentials at home. The most unexpected challenge of his presidency -- Covid-19 -- has perhaps . More than two years of lockdowns and mask mandates, a fumbled EU vaccine rollout and the bold move to effectively  have fired up vocal opposition, even as most of the country learned to live with the realities of the virus and a quiet majority supported the measures.Macron has refused to debate his opponents and has hardly campaigned himself. While his pole position in the race has never really been under threat, experts believe his strategy has been to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible in order to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates.But a week out from the first vote, Macron urged his supporters to guard against complacency. \"Anything is possible,\" he told them, warning of the possibility of a Brexit-style upset in the election. \"French electoral logic means that in the second round, you have to be the least hated of the two remaining candidates,\" Etienne Girard, editor of L'Express magazine, told CNN. While France's first round sees ballots cast across the political spectrum, in the second round many vote to keep a candidate out of office as much as to elect their opponent. That's been a problem for , who has been synonymous with the French far-right for much of the past decade.Now an MP in the Calais region -- the gateway to the UK that has struggled to deal with migrants heading to Britain -- the anti-immigrant Le Pen faced off against Macron in 2017, but .Her father, fellow far-right firebrand Jean-Marie Le Pen, also lost in the second round -- in his case to Chirac in 2002.Marine Le Pen's strategy for this election was originally one of winning mainstream support -- \"a strategy of respectability,\" as Girard describes it. While still strongly anti-immigrant, the softening of her tone around flagship topics like Islam and euroskepticism -- especially since Brexit -- has been widely touted as an effort to win over voters outside her far-right base. Even so, \"stopping uncontrolled immigration\" and \"eradicating Islamist ideologies\" are her manifesto's top two priorities. A fan of Vladimir Putin -- a photo of her visiting the Russian president featured on a since-scrapped campaign leaflet -- the war in Ukraine has brought up uncomfortable questions for Le Pen. But in the campaign's final weeks, she's put the cost of living front and center of her platform, promising measures that she claims will in the pockets of each household, including a pledge to lift sales tax on 100 household goods.Le Pen is known for capturing hard-to-reach voters, according to pollster Emmanuel Riviere. \"She always manages to seduce people who are not interested in politics at all, precisely because she offers them a solution to express their anger towards politics,\" he told CNN.  is currently polling far higher than she did at the 2017 election. Days out from the first round, IFOP polling suggests she may win 47% of votes in a second round runoff against Macron.The new kid on the block, far-right TV pundit and author Eric Zemmour had long been touted as a possible presidential contender. Known for his uncompromising stances on Islam, children with non-French names and immigration, he has twice been convicted for inciting racial or religious hatred. As a presidential candidate, he has doubled down on his race-driven rhetoric, touting the  in his speeches and promising a \"ministry for re-immigration\" to deport as many as 1 million people of North African descent from France. The theory contends that immigrants want to \"replace\" the native-born French population. Zemmour enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to IFOP polling, challenging the Le Pen family's dominance of the political far-right. He openly cites Islam as a danger menacing France and has attracted a more educated and affluent demographic to the political extreme, according to Riviere. Well-read and a talented orator, his appeal to \"save our homeland, our civilization, our culture\" has struck a chord with some. \"People, when they sit in front of their TVs and listen to him, they feel like they're being elevated. And that, in France, is something that is expected enormously from a political leader,\" said Girard, who has also written a biography of Zemmour. Ultimately, though, he is treading on the toes of Le Pen.\"They are really in direct competition with each other because their confrontation can make them lose big to one or the other,\" Riviere said. Zemmour -- who in 2018 proudly confessed to \"dreaming\" of a French Putin -- has seen his popularity wane since the war in Ukraine began.Zemmour was publicly convinced that Putin would never invade, then even after he did. Zemmour has since condemned the invasion -- something of a U-turn in his support for the Russian president. In Jean-Luc Melenchon, the French far-left has its firebrand politician too. The leader of the \"France Unbowed\" party, veteran activist and politician Melenchon has stood in three presidential contests so far. Among his flagship policies are a \"fiscal revolution,\" a radical rethinking of French governance towards more direct involvement of the electorate and a 1 billion-euro plan to combat violence against women -- a hot-button issue in France. But devoid of a unifying candidate, the French left seems to have little chance of challenging for a second-round place. Melenchon has a loyal base among voters from the far-left but he's struggled to win over more centrist voters.Both , Mayor of Paris and the left-wing Socialist Party's presidential candidate, and , of the right-wing Republicans party, have struggled to make headway in the polls -- a damning indictment of the French political mainstream. Their parties suffered from the creation of Macron's centrist \"La Republique En Marche\" party in 2016, and have yet to recover.But while Macron may be in the lead as French voters prepare to go to the polls, April may yet have surprises in store. \"In this country, anything is possible. We've seen the impossible come true in other countries,\" political commentator Aphatie said. \"Donald Trump elected? Never.\" Incumbent Macron is out in front, according to polling from IFOP, which suggests his levels of support haven't dropped below 24% since January, and rose to a high of 31% in the first weeks of the war in Ukraine.Similarly, Marine Le Pen has held on to second place for almost all of the past three months -- hitting a high of 21% at the end of March -- according to IFOP.All of which would seem to set up a rerun of the 2017 second round. But while Macron walked away with almost two-thirds of the votes last time around, IFOP polling suggests that this year a Macron-Le Pen faceoff could result in the incumbent taking 53% of the vote to 47% for Le Pen, a much less comfortable margin of victory for Macron. The cost of living is among the top issues for the French electorate this year. Faced with the economic fallout of the pandemic, high energy prices and the war in Ukraine, voters are feeling the pinch, despite generous government support.While financial pressures may not be enough to whitewash some candidates' extremism in voters' minds, they may push some to look for unorthodox answers to their problems. The fighting in Ukraine is a long way from the bistros and cafes of France, but the conflict is certainly on voters' minds. Just shy of 90% of French people were worried about the war in the last week of March, according to IFOP. Given the challengers' patchy record on standing up to Putin, this is likely to play in Macron's favor. Notably absent from the debate has been the environmental crisis. Although the importance of climate protections is gaining traction globally, France sourced 75% of its electricity needs in 2020 from nuclear energy, according to the French environment ministry. With most candidates backing the kind of nuclear development that Macron has already announced, there is little divergence on this issue.For all the fanfare that this election once promised, with a war on the European Union's border and many voters struggling to pay their bills, France's choice may now rest more on the next five months than the next five years.

And some content about major brands on the app doesn't seem to be coming from the brands themselves, according to CNN.When CNN  for the wallstreetbets community on Reddit whether they were controlling the content about their community on Truth Social, the response was telling. The spokesperson said that Truth Social was \"running the account as an RSS feed under our subreddit name\" and while Truth Social had offered to allow the community to run its account itself, the offer was \"declined\" because \"a core tenet of our community is remaining apolitical.\" The response reveals that people and organizations recognize that participating in this social network is a political act -- one that directly aligns themselves with the former President and all he has come to represent. Sixty-one percent , who according to a March 2022 Marquette Law School poll, hold an unfavorable view of the former President, likely would not find that an attractive premise.Truth Social and Trump Media and Technology Group, the app's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. Trump, let's recall, is famous for using social media to tweet what  was essentially an invitation to extremists to storm the Capitol last year. The former President has denied any responsibility for the January 6 insurrection. As a result of the attack, he's been on Twitter and  for at least two years by Facebook.  Trump also refused to accept that he lost the 2020 presidential election -- and , through failed litigation, pressure on election officials and pressure on his vice president. And he's been widely recognized as a man who makes , calling everyone from Vice President Kamala Harris to Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen \"nasty.\" He also has a history of attacking minority groups -- from  to . In his book, \"Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It,\" Helio Fred Garcia  after Trump verbally attacked groups, including Hispanics and Muslims, hate crimes against them increased.In short, to sign up for Truth Social is to lend legitimacy to the former President and his behavior. It's no wonder that a lot of companies and people aren't clamoring to do so: they recognize that joining would cause self-inflicted reputational damage to themselves by mere association.As a result, it simply isn't possible for this social network to take off on a significant scale. After all, the value of a social network to a user depends in large part on how many other people are using it. If users can't communicate with a lot of other people and groups because they aren't on the platform, joining becomes a less attractive proposition. The idea that the value of something like a social network increases as its number of users increases is known as . Even if you don't discuss politics on a social network with a relative or friend with whom you disagree, you still might like seeing pictures of their kids growing up, or benefit from being able to contact them to arrange a carpool to soccer practice or plan Thanksgiving dinner.While it's remarkable that a social network started by a person who bills himself as a successful businessman and who previously served as leader of the free world appears to be plagued by so much mismanagement, that's not the ultimate root of the problem here. The insurmountable obstacle Truth Social faces is that Trump's reputation has undermined its chances of long-term success. Most Americans do not want to associate with anything he creates. And a social network on which you can't actually be social or network with many people is destined for failure.",

        "content": "Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after regulators in Beijing  to the United States, indicating they could change their policies so that Chinese companies could avoid getting kicked off Wall Street.What's happening: Shares of tech giant   in New York rallied almost 7% on Monday. E-commerce platforms   and   leaped 16% and 7%, respectively.But the celebration may have been a bit premature, as negotiators from the United States and China continue to hammer out the details and tensions between the world's two largest economies simmer beneath the surface.\"The policy is still evolving, and there's still a lot of uncertainty,\" Xiaomeng Lu of the consultancy Eurasia Group told me.Over the weekend, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's top securities watchdog, proposed changing a decade-old rule that forbids Chinese firms from sharing sensitive data and financial information with overseas regulators.Remember: US regulators have long complained that they can't access the books of Chinese companies. In 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law, giving the Securities and Exchange Commission power to kick foreign companies off Wall Street if they fail to allow US regulators to review their audits for three straight years.But Beijing, citing national security concerns, has been resistant to overhauling its policies. It requires companies that are traded overseas to hold their audits in mainland China, where they cannot be examined by foreign agencies.The new amendment might finally allow US regulators to dig into these contested materials. If that helps resolve the dispute, it could ease a huge source of concern for the more than 200 Chinese firms listed in the United States, which have been battered over the last year.But it's too soon to say for sure. It's not clear if US regulators will see the potential changes as sufficient. Last week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler poured cold water on the idea that a deal was imminent. \"There have been thoughtful, respectful, productive conversations, but I don't know where this is going to end up,\" Gensler said. \"It's up to the Chinese authorities, and it could be frankly a hard set of choices for them.\"Another sticking point, according to Lu, is whether there is a carve-out for companies that have access to sensitive data about the Chinese government or infrastructure.The \"only clear data point we have so far,\" she emphasized, is Didi. The ride-hailing service had to begin delisting from New York shortly after its initial public offering last year. Beijing launched a crackdown on the company, saying its app broke privacy laws and posed cybersecurity risks. What comes next: Lu said she sees a roughly 70% chance that some kind of deal between Washington and Beijing is reached this year. But she still thinks it's likely that some Chinese firms will need to delist from Wall Street at that point.She noted that Alibaba isn't just an online marketplace, but also a cloud business. If it provides services to state-owned enterprises, Chinese regulators may still want it to keep its books private.It's not every day that the uber-rich CEO of one of America's top companies takes a huge stake in a totally different business. But that's exactly what the ever-unpredictable Elon Musk has done.The latest: The   chief in   on Monday, sending shares of the social media platform surging 27%.The investment — which was valued at almost $3.7 billion when the market closed — makes him Twitter's biggest shareholder.  Musk didn't disclose the purpose of the purchase or any plans for the company. But that hasn't stopped speculation about what drove the surprise move.Analysts expect Musk, who has been a vocal critic of Twitter policies, to actively push for changes to how the company operates. Last month, he said he was giving \"serious thought\" to creating a new social media platform.\"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,\" Musk recently tweeted. \"What should be done?\"He's also suggested (by tweeting a meme, of course) that he does not support CEO Parag Agrawal, who recently took over from Jack Dorsey.\"Musk has already indicated that he did not agree with the appointment of Agrawal and that he desires some changes,\" Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in a note to clients.First order of business: After his stake was disclosed, Musk tweeted a poll asking whether Twitter users wanted an edit button. But some suspect he could agitate for even bigger shifts at the company. There's speculation Musk could partner with other activist investors, or even create a consortium to take Twitter private. The company is worth $40 billion. That's a fraction of rival Meta, which has a market value of $637 billion.   made waves with its decision this week to pause share buybacks, the first big move Howard Schultz made following his return as CEO. Could the world's biggest oil companies be next? That's what top Democrats in the House of Representatives .House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Ro Khanna, chair of the environment subcommittee, want  ,  ,   and   to scrap stock buyback programs and dividends during the war in Ukraine and put that money toward lowering prices at the gas pump.\"Fossil fuel companies are taking advantage of the crisis by raking in record profits and spending billions of dollars to enrich their executives and investors,\" they wrote in a letter dated Monday. The lawmakers also urged the oil companies to make \"meaningful investments\" in solar, wind and other forms of clean energy to address the climate crisis.Oil companies — which are cashing in on soaring energy prices — have faced sustained calls to use spare cash to offset the pain for everyday consumers. In the United States and United Kingdom, there have been calls for a  to help households cover energy bills.Coming up: The issue is likely to feature in a House hearing on Wednesday, where executives from BP, Exxon, Chevron and Shell are scheduled to testify.The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which tracks the US services sector, arrives at 10 a.m. ET.Coming tomorrow: Investors will scrutinize minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting for signs of how aggressive the central bank could be later this year.",

        "content": "Pakistan is in  as the South Asian country awaits a key court ruling that will decide whether embattled Prime Minister Imran Khan's plan for an early election can go ahead.Khan called the election in a dramatic attempt to cling to power after the deputy speaker of parliament blocked a no-confidence motion against him last Sunday that had appeared almost certain to succeed.That move, and Khan's subsequent dissolution of parliament, enraged an opposition that for months have been demanding his removal over claims of poor governance and economic mismanagement. The opposition responded by accusing Khan of treason and asking the country's highest court to rule on whether the Prime Minister had breached the constitution. The court battle is the latest escalation in a crisis that has been smoldering for weeks, with Khan already having lost the backing of key political allies and the country's powerful military.Khan's main hope now appears to be that his enduring popular appeal with voters -- fueled by his stellar former cricket career, his unique brand of Islamic populism and his claims of foreign interference in Pakistan's affairs -- can keep him in the driving seat.But an unfavorable ruling by the Supreme Court -- which resumes its hearing on Tuesday -- would leave Khan's leadership hanging by a thread.Pakistan, a nation of 220 million, is notoriously hard to govern. It has struggled with political instability since its formation in 1947 with multiple regime changes and military coups. No Prime Minister has ever completed a full five-year term. Khan's problems date back to 2018, when he rose to power in an election mired in accusations of vote-rigging and foul play.More recently, he has been dogged by claims of economic mismanagement. The cost of basic necessities such as food and fuel are skyrocketing, with inflation in the double digits, and the government's foreign exchange reserves are fast depleting.Some members of Khan's coalition government had deserted him over his perceived failure to work with them and he has alienated the military -- long a kingmaker in the country's politics -- that once supported him.On March 8, the opposition filed for a no-confidence vote to be held in parliament as they urged Khan to resign. The Prime Minister's subsequent actions have only fueled his critics, with opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif calling them \"nothing short of high treason.\"Pakistan's military, which has long influenced foreign policy, appears to have been angered by a series of diplomatic moves by Khan that have shifted the country away from the United States and closer to China and Russia.For much of his term, Khan has pushed anti-American rhetoric, blaming the US for the situation in Afghanistan. In a sign of how frayed relations have become, US President Joe Biden and Khan have not spoken since Biden took office last year.In a move that further distanced Pakistan from the US, Khan recently refused to condemn , even meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow the day Russia began its war.The military has appeared to clash with Khan on these issues. In an April 2 speech, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, said the country shared \"a long history of excellent relationship with the United States.\" Maintaining relations with Washington was \"vital\" to Pakistan's national interests, he added.\"Russian aggression on Ukraine is very unfortunate. This is a huge tragedy,\" Bajwa said. \"Pakistan desires immediate cessation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and is doing everything it can to resolve the issue.\"Despite this, the military says it has \"absolutely no\" connection to the current crisis, which it described as \"purely a political matter.\"Throughout the crisis, Khan has rejected criticism of his leadership.Instead -- and without offering evidence -- he has repeatedly claimed the moves against him are an attempt at regime change backed by Washington and some members of the opposition.Both the US State Department and Pakistani opposition have denied Khan's allegations.But when Khan called for parliament to be dissolved and an early election to take place, the deputy speaker -- who was appointed by Khan -- justified the move on the basis of an alleged \"foreign conspiracy.\"For now, Khan remains in power. Last Sunday, Pakistan's information minister said Khan will continue with his responsibilities under the rules of the constitution.But his future as Prime Minister will depend largely on the Supreme Court ruling and whether an early election can go ahead.Analysts say there could be three possible outcomes.The first -- most favored by the opposition -- is that the court says the dismissal of the no-confidence vote was unconstitutional and overturns Khan's decision to call for an early election. If this happens, Khan could once again face a no-confidence vote he is widely expected to lose.In a second scenario, the court may rule Khan's move was unconstitutional but refuse to restore the assembly, arguing it lacks jurisdiction to do so. In this scenario, an early election could go ahead anyway.A third potential outcome could see the court decline to make a ruling, effectively upholding Khan's actions and paving the way for early elections. If Khan prevails, Pakistan could head to the polls within 90 days. Some 16 years after becoming a lawmaker, Khan was elected Prime Minister in 2018, vowing to eradicate poverty and corruption and promising a \"new Pakistan.\"He has enjoyed widespread popular support since then, with tens of thousands taking to the streets in the capital, Islamabad, in recent days to support him.Khan's allegations of foreign interference appear aimed at shoring up his support among a public in which anti-American sentiment can sometimes run strong.Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, said this would be a \"tough\" move for the opposition to counter.\"He's a great orator. Still a large number of people continue to support (Khan). This is populism in its full glory,\" Mehboob said. Khan has dialed things up with repeated calls for his supporters to rally in Islamabad. He has also accused the opposition of corruption. \"We have made the decision to dissolve (parliament) because ever since I came to power I was being asked to resign,\" he said in an address to the nation on Monday.  Still, Surya Deva, a professor at Macquarie Law School in Sydney, said Khan's move for an early election could backfire. Khan has \"not been able to manage the economy well and with a growing rift with both external and internal allies, even elections will not be easy for him,\" Deva said.CNN's Sophia Saifi wrote from Islamabad and Rhea Mogul wrote from Hong Kong.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka, an island nation of 22 million, is facing an , with protesters taking to the streets in defiance of curfews and government ministers stepping down en masse.Driving the discontent is the worst economic downturn since the South Asian country gained independence in 1948, with crippling inflation sending the cost of basic goods skyrocketing.Anger, which has been , boiled over last Thursday,  -- and throwing the government into disorder. Here's what you need to know.Experts say the crisis has been years in the making, driven by a little bad luck and a lot of government mismanagement.Over the past decade, the Sri Lankan government has borrowed vast sums of money from foreign lenders to fund public services, said Murtaza Jafferjee, chair of Colombo-based think tank Advocata Institute.This borrowing spree has coincided with a series of hammer blows to the Sri Lankan economy, from both natural disasters -- such as heavy monsoons -- to man-made catastrophes, including a government ban on chemical fertilizers that decimated farmers' harvests. These problems were compounded in 2018, when the President's dismissal of the Prime Minister sparked a constitutional crisis; the following year, when hundreds of people at churches and luxury hotels were killed in the 2019 Easter bombings; and from 2020 onwards with the arrival of the . Facing a massive deficit, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa slashed taxes in a doomed attempt to stimulate the economy.But the move backfired, instead hitting government revenue. That prompted rating agencies to downgrade Sri Lanka to near default levels, meaning the country lost access to overseas markets.Sri Lanka then had to fall back on its foreign exchange reserves to pay off government debt, shrinking its reserves from $6.9 billion in 2018 to $2.2 billion this year. This impacted imports of fuel and other essentials, which sent prices soaring. Topping all that, the government in March floated the Sri Lankan rupee -- meaning its price was determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange markets.That move appeared aimed at devaluing the currency to qualify for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and encourage remittances. However, the plunging of the rupee against the US dollar only made things worse for ordinary Sri Lankans.For Sri Lankans, the crisis has turned their daily lives into an endless cycle of waiting in lines for basic goods, many of which are being rationed.In recent weeks, shops have been forced to close because they can't run fridges, air conditioners or fans. Soldiers are stationed at gas stations to calm customers, who line up for hours in the searing heat to fill their tanks. Some people have even died waiting.One mother in the capital, Colombo, told CNN she was waiting for propane gas so that she could cook meals for her family. Others say the cost of bread has more than doubled, while auto rickshaw and taxi drivers say the fuel rations are too meager to make a living. Some are caught in an impossible position -- they have to work to feed their families, but must also queue for supplies. One street sweeper with two young sons told CNN she quietly slips away from work to join lines for food, before hurrying back.Even members of the middle class with savings are frustrated, fearing they could run out of essentials like medicine or gas. And life is made more difficult by frequent power cuts that plunge Colombo into darkness, sometimes for more than 10 hours at a time.Protesters in Colombo took to the streets in late March, demanding government action and accountability. Public frustration and anger erupted on March 31, when demonstrators hurled bricks and started fires outside the President's private residence. Police used tear gas and water cannons to break up the protests, and imposed a 36-hour curfew afterward. President Rajapaksa declared a nationwide public emergency on April 1, giving authorities powers to detain people without a warrant, and blocked social media platforms. But protests went ahead the next day in defiance of the curfew, prompting police to arrest hundreds of demonstrators. Protests have continued in the days since, though they remained largely peaceful. On Tuesday night, crowds of student protesters surrounded Rajapaksa's residence again, calling for his resignation.The emergency ordinance was revoked on April 5.The government's entire cabinet was effectively dissolved on April 3 due to mass resignations by top ministers.Some 26 cabinet ministers stepped down that weekend, including the President's nephew, who criticized the apparent social media blackout as something he would \"never condone.\" Other major figures including the governor of the central bank also resigned.Facing an administration in chaos, on Monday the President attempted a reshuffle he hoped would placate the opposition. Four ministers, including a finance minister, were appointed to temporarily run the government, while several others were handed new posts in an attempt to keep the country functioning \"until a full cabinet is appointed,\" according to a presidential news release. But just a day later, the temporary finance minister quit -- explaining he had only taken the position due to \"multitudes of requests made,\" and that he realized afterward \"fresh and proactive and unconventional steps need to be taken.\"And the reshuffle failed to stop further desertions. The ruling Sri Lanka People's Front Coalition (also known as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) lost 41 seats by Tuesday after members from several partner parties pulled out to continue as independent groups. The coalition was left with only 104 seats, losing its majority in parliament.President Rajapaksa issued a statement Monday but did not directly address the resignations, only urging all parties to \"work together for the sake of all the citizens and future generations.\"\"The current crisis is a result of several economic factors and global developments,\" the statement read. \"As one of the leading democratic countries in Asia, solutions should be found to this within a democratic framework.\"Later that day, when announcing the cabinet reshuffle, the President's office released a statement saying Rajapaksa \"sought the support of all the people to overcome the economic challenge faced by the country.\"Previously, Rajapaksa has said he is attempting to resolve the issue, saying in an address to the nation last month that \"this crisis was not created by me.\"On April 1, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa -- the President's elder brother and a former President himself -- told CNN it was wrong to say the government had mismanaged the economy. Instead, Covid-19 was one of the causes, he said.Sri Lanka is now seeking financial support from the IMF and turning to regional powers that may be able to help.During last month's address, President Rajapaksa said he had weighed the pros and cons of working with the IMF and had decided to pursue a bailout from the Washington-based institution -- something his government had been reluctant to do.Sri Lanka has also requested help from China and India, with New Delhi already issuing a credit line of $1 billion in March -- but some analysts warned that this assistance might just prolong the crisis rather than solve it.There is still much uncertainty around what comes next; national consumer price inflation has almost tripled, from 6.2% in September to 17.5% in February, according to the country's central bank. And Sri Lanka has to repay about $4 billion in debt over the rest of this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond that matures in July.CNN's Julia Hollingsworth, Rukshana Rizwie and Iqbal Athas contributed reporting.",

        "content": "A  cyclist says she has been \"harassed and demonised\" by the media after the UCI, world cycling's governing body, ruled she couldn't compete at the National Omnium Championships in the United Kingdom over the weekend.Emily Bridges, who was set to race against British Olympic stars such as Laura Kenny in the event, said she found out through British Cycling on Wednesday that the UCI had ruled she was ineligible.The 21-year-old said in a statement she has been in contact with British Cycling and the UCI for the past six months ahead of what was supposed to be her first race in a women's event.\"In that time, I have provided both British Cycling and the UCI with medical evidence that I meet the eligibility criteria for transgender female cyclists, including that my testosterone limit has been far below the limit prescribed by the regulations for the last 12 months,\" Bridges said in her statement, which was posted by LGBTQIA+ cycling group PRiDE OUT.As of March 1 2020, UCI regulations state that transgender women must reduce their testosterone levels to below 5 nmol/L for at least 12 months in order to compete in women's events.The UCI did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. CNN has reached out to Bridges directly but is yet to hear back.However, the Guardian reported the UCI prevented Bridges from competing because it said she was still registered as a male cyclist and therefore ineligible to compete as a female until her male UCI identification expired.\"I am an athlete, and I just want to race competitively again,\" Bridges' statement continued. \"No one should have to choose between being who they are, and participating in the sport that they love....\"As is no surprise with most of the British media, I've been relentlessly harassed and demonised by those who have a specific agenda to push. They attack anything that isn't the norm and print whatever is most likely to result in the highest engagement for their articles, and bring in advertising.\"This is without care for the wellbeing of individuals or marginalised groups, and others are left to pick up the pieces due to their actions.\"Bridges initially posted the statement on her Instagram account, but has since made the account private.On Wednesday, British Cycling released a statement calling for a coalition to address transgender and non-binary participation in sport. While British Cycling said they  \"acknowledge\" the UCI's decision, they also \"fully recognise\" Bridges' disappointment with the outcome.\"Transgender and non-binary inclusion is bigger than one race and one athlete -- it is a challenge for all elite sports,\" the statement read.\"We believe all participants within our sport deserve more clarity and understanding around participation in elite competitions and we will continue to work with the UCI on both Emily's case and the wider situation with regards to this issue.\"We also understand that in elite sports the concept of fairness is essential. For this reason, British Cycling is today calling for a coalition to share, learn and understand more about how we can achieve fairness in a way that maintains the dignity and respect of all athletes.\"Across sports, far more needs to be done, collectively, before any long-term conclusions can be drawn.\"Among the female athletes to express opposition to Bridges' inclusion in the event was British 800m runner Ellie Baker, who labeled the original decision as \"ridiculous.\"\"How this has been allowed to happen is just ridiculous,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"I would refuse to race and hope that the other women would stand with me on this too. This is totally unfair. The advantages a trans women has had from going through puberty as a boy to a man can never been undone.\"Fellow athletes Seren-Bundy Davies and Jessie Knight were among those to express support for Baker's post, as well as former British swimmer Sharron Davies.In the velodrome, 19-year-old Sophie Lewis won the title at the National Omnium Championships.",

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also confirmed he plans to push for changes at the company.\"Looking forward to working with [Twitter CEO] Parag [Agrawal] & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!\" Musk  Tuesday morning. It's just the latest chapter in Musk's, shall we say, colorful, nearly 13-year history on  , where he's played the roles of critic and power-user.His tweets — which range from commentary about his companies,   and SpaceX, to sometimes controversial statements about pop culture and current events to niche memes — are watched by more than 80 million followers, more than any other CEO on the platform. His (often vague) comments about cryptocurrency have shown the potential to  in crypto markets. And just last month, more than 2 million people responded to a poll he tweeted asking, \"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\" Around 70% voted no. Musk's Twitter presence began facing increased scrutiny in 2018. Over the course of a few months, he , lashed out at journalists covering Tesla,  an April Fool's Day joke about Tesla going bankrupt, and made an unfounded and disparaging claim about a rescuer who aided in the mission that saved a youth soccer team from a flooded cave in Thailand. That led a top analyst to  encouraging Musk to take a break from the platform. Musk being Musk, he did no such thing; instead, his behavior on the platform continued to escalate. A month after the open letter was posted, Musk  that he was \"considering taking Tesla private at $420\" and that he had \"funding secured,\" sparking a frenzy and sending shares in the automaker up to $371 from $342. The Securities and Exchange Commission later said the funding had, in fact, not been secured and suedfor making \"false and misleading\" statements to investors. As part of his settlement with the agency, Musk must have certain tweets about Tesla reviewed by lawyers before he can post them, a provision he is . Beyond his spat with the SEC, Musk has faced blowback for using Twitter to spread  about Covid-19, and for , and Senators ,  and . Musk also earlier this year  a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler. And he had a  with a college freshman who rejected a $5,000 offer from Musk to remove a Twitter account tracking the billionaire's private jet. (Musk has also used his Twitter feed to push back on coverage of himself and his companies that he disagrees with, including  at CNN and other outlets.)Some other memorable Musk tweets: The  Kanye West \"you have my full support!\" in running for President of the United States. The time  he was \"thinking of starting new university: Texas Institute of Technology & Science\" — note the potential acronym there — and said it \"will have epic merch.\" And then there are the many attempts at marijuana and sex jokes, including : \"Due to inflation 420 has gone up by 69.\" Now, Musk could go from one of the most prominent voices on Twitter to one of the most influential inside the company. It's not clear exactly what changes Musk plan to agitate for at Twitter. In addition to his comments about the need to preserve \"free speech\" on the platform, he has suggested that Twitter should make its algorithm open source. On Monday night, he , asking if they \"want an edit button,\" a longtime feature request, if a divisive one, from many Twitter users.\"While we are not sure about Musk's intentions — whether he will further increase his stake, become an active shareholder, and/or demand a seat on the firm's board -— we believe his communication to the firm, other shareholders, and the platform's 217 million daily active users could affect Twitter's long-term strategy,\" Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in a note to investors Monday. \"Musk could seek to influence the openness of the platform and how it controls content or push to invest in the subscription model more aggressively as it has with .\"Agrawal, Twitter's new CEO, tweeted Tuesday that Musk is \"both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term.\"Still, it's unclear what Musk's relationship with Agrawal is like.In December, Musk  a meme that equated Agrawal to former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and depicted Twitter founder and recently departed CEO Jack Dorsey as a former Stalin confidant the dictator later had assassinated. But on Monday, Agrawal appeared to play along with Musk on Twitter, responding to his poll about the edit button by saying, \"The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.\"Musk has generally appeared to have a positive relationship with Dorsey, who remains on Twitter's board. The two tech founders have  in their support for cryptocurrency, and Musk expressed support for Dorsey in 2020 when he was facing criticism from some shareholders. \"Just want [to] say that I support @Jack as Twitter CEO.

It was conceived by cousins , raced between , and timed to finish as the new queen was being crowned at Westminster Abbey, London.The Coronation Rally became the East African Safari Rally in 1960 and was added to the World Rally Championship (WRC) calendar during the following decade before being dropped in 2003 and continuing as an independent event.Rallies were broadcast on national TV, with  and an infectious energy that swept through the public, recalls photographer Mwangi \"Mwarv\" Kirubi, who documented this year's rally and has been watching them since he was a child. \"It doesn't matter what your upbringing was, what your tribe was, your educational status or even your age. It's one thing that actually brought everyone together,\" he says.In its current incarnation, the East African Safari Classic, the country's longest race, has a distinctly old-school ethos. Cars must be built before 1985, with only limited tinkering permitted (changing the suspension is allowed, but replacing the gearbox or engine isn't, for example). The cars -- Porsche 911s and Ford Escorts feature heavily -- race across 24 stages in nine days on a 5,000-kilometer route, with drivers covering more than 700 kilometers on some days. \"It's no joke,\" says Bengi. \"It's (a longer race than) a whole season of motorsports in other disciplines.\"With no prize, drivers compete solely for bragging rights. As a result, the event attracts motorsport legends looking to test their mettle. This year, 46 teams from around the world made it to the start line. One of the biggest names was international rally champion and five-time X Games medalist Ken Block. \"I've always wanted to come and do it,\" he told CNN. \"It's just a genuinely really difficult event and one of the best classic rallies in the entire world.\"The rally pits professionals like Block against part-timers like Bengi, and though there may be a gulf between the quality of their cars, the event has enough unpredictability in its DNA to allow for upsets.One aspect is the local conditions, which can swing between downpours and dustbowl. Then there's the many wild animals on the route, which drivers sometimes have to wait for or drive around. The main factor, however, is that the race is conducted blind -- that is, drivers and navigators do not get to inspect the route ahead of racing and create detailed notes. Instead, stage routes are shared with teams a day in advance, with no opportunity to preview the terrain. As clerk of the course, it's Raju Chaggar's job to create the roadbook -- a year-round task that sees him driving approximately 52,000 kilometers to mark out the route and check its condition in the lead up to the race. \"Nobody knows where we are rallying ... It's the hardest secret to keep,\" he admits.This year's race, held between February 10 and 18, traversed Kenya and took teams through towns and cities including Naivasha, Nakuru, Nanyuki, Amboseli, Taita-Taveta and Watamu, as well as passing through multiple national parks. Racing takes place on public roads and is generally slower than most rallies, on account of the older cars' top speeds, the long, demanding stages and blind racing. But unlike WRC events, teams can rely on the public when things go awry; organizers have no issue with spectators providing roadside assistance if a car gets stuck.\"You can tell a Kenyan there's a rally coming up (and) they will leave everything,\" says Chaggar. \"They're willing to spend nine hours out in the sun just to watch the rally. It's very unique. I think we're crazy.\"Teams need all the help they can get. From sourcing fuel, servicing the cars and sleeping in a new town every night, \"it's a whole logistical nightmare,\" says Bengi.In their first year togethercompeting in the Classic rally, Bengi and Gatimu overcame every hurdle to cross the finishing line in a respectable 17th position (surpassing Block in ). First place went to Kenyan Baldev Chager driving a Porsche 911, who triumphed in the overall race despite not winning a single stage, testament to the rally's fickle nature.Kenyan drivers occupied three of the top five positions. Even so, there's space for expansion and professionalization in the country, says Bengi, who points out the country has no factory drivers (professional drivers backed by car manufacturers). \"There's room for development, and I think with more and more events coming up we can develop new talent,\" he says.Rally racing is experiencing a resurgence in Kenya. The WRC returned after a 19-year absence with the 2021 Safari Rally Kenya, which has since been . While a stronger foothold in the international scene might take time and investment, at home Kenyan drivers are in their element and thriving.\"This is our backyard,\" says photographer Kirubi. \"These are the roads we grew up on; the roads we used (to go) to school, to work, to the farm ... It comes as no surprise that we have local drivers taking top spots within the (Classic) rally. Somebody may come with a racing pedigree from the US or Europe, but man, this is Africa -- and we play it different.\"",

        "content": "With nothing but her small boat for company, British lawyer  battled high winds, big waves and sleep deprivation to record the fastest female solo row across the .After setting off from Tenerife, Spain, on February 11, the 35-year-old covered 4,740 kilometers in 40 days and 19 hours before finally reaching land in Barbados. Despite experiencing  and encountering multiple problems along the way, Evans broke the previous world record by over eight days. \"It was much harder than I expected,\" she told CNN Sport. \"Not physically, but in terms of the conditions.\"I got probably the strongest kind of wind you can get out on the Atlantic for a very prolonged period and the resilience you need to keep going through that was huge.\"Evans had spent four years preparing for this journey of a lifetime but nothing could have readied her for the reality of an ocean crossing. Even before setting off, the trip was plagued by issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic which forced the challenge to be postponed by a year. Then there was the logistical nightmare of getting the boat, and herself, across borders to reach the start point in Spain, with Evans requiring additional government support to do so.Once the challenge was underway, high winds made rowing -- and sleeping -- incredibly difficult, while issues with steering equipment caused Evans to drift off track at times. At one point she was even stuck outside of her cabin after a wave locked the door from the inside. It took her three hours to saw through the lock with a blade.There were the inevitable blisters and occasional sunburn, though by the sound of it Evans seems to thrive in extreme conditions.\"It's a very unique sport in that you can't get off when you're there and you have to deal with it. So it was so, so intense,\" said Evans, who was inspired to tackle crossing the Atlantic after climbing Mont Blanc in 2017.  \"I think I really enjoy adventure sport due to the psychological elements of it and how much it forces you to learn about yourself and face up to yourself and the limits of where you can push yourself to,\" added Evans.\"We are so capable of training our brains to allow us to achieve more but often people don't want to put that work in.\" Evans lost just 4 kilograms on the journey, something she credits to her physical preparation and her simple yet nutritious diet while on board -- using food as a pick-me-up whenever she felt overwhelmed. Music became very important to Evans during the crossing. After all, no one can hear you sing when you're thousands of miles from land. David Bowie, Elton John and Sam Fender's new album provided some of the hundreds of hours of music blared out amid the waves, offering unwavering motivation and a bit of company while Evans plugged away in total isolation. Isolation, that is, minus the \"special\" wildlife she got the honor of seeing along the way.Turtles, sharks and numerous fish offered light relief to the mammoth slog and Evans would take time to stop rowing whenever something popped its head out of the water.She even saw a super pod of dolphins as she celebrated her 35th birthday . \"It was like they'd heard there was a party. I've never seen anything like it. Everywhere you look, there were dolphins,\" she said. Despite admitting she doesn't miss the stress of life on the ocean, Evans knows it was an experience she will never get again, smiling as she recalls the times she would cover up her navigation lights and stare up to the unspoilt night sky, getting lost in the stars above.  \"You're never going to be there again and it's easy to lose sight of that when you're chasing the record, because you're trying to go as quickly as possible, she said. Admitting she wasn't particularly sporty as a child, Evans says her 15-year-old self would never have believed she was capable of setting such a record.While the challenge was a personal goal for Evans, she also completed it to raise awareness and money for UK charity  which looks to \"give every woman and girl the opportunity to take part in sport.\" Evans has raised over £24,000 ($31,526) already for the charity and, through her legal work, she wants to advocate for more change now she's back on dry land. \"Women are so capable in sport,\" she said. \"It is massively improving, but there seems to still be an underestimation of women.\"I'd want the message to be for everyone, but particularly women and girls, to know that they're capable of absolutely anything they set their mind to. \"And on a wider level for sport as an industry to show that change needs to come and it's an outdated viewpoint to assume that we need a helping hand or smaller events.\" Before getting to work, Evans was enjoying life in Barbados. Joined by her family and friends, she spent her first night on dry land watching the sun set over the ocean she just conquered. But make no mistake, she has no plans to get back in a boat anytime soon. \"I never felt that I was in immediate, serious risk but I was very much aware that one change could put me into a life threatening situation,\" she said. \"I'm not going to miss the stress of that.\"",

        "content": "  is moving its business into the exosphere, with plans to deploy more than 3,000 satellites to beam internet connectivity all over the planet. On Tuesday, the company announced deals with three rocket companies that will launch those satellites.The agreement includes two veteran rocket builders — United Launch Alliance, which is joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and European company Arianespace — as well as Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, which is still working to develop a rocket capable of reaching orbit. Bezos remains the executive chairman of Amazon.The contracts include a total of up to 83 launches, which Amazon is calling one of the largest commercial launch deals ever inked. The launches will take place over about five years. All three rockets that Amazon plans to use for these missions are not in operation yet but are expected to enter service later this year or 2023. Financial details were not disclosed.In an interview with  Tuesday, Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices and services, said only that the contracts will cost Amazon \"billions.\" He added that the company's goal is to launch a few test satellites to orbit within the next year or so. And, if all goes to plan, Amazon will deploy at least half the Project Kuiper constellation, or more than 1,600 satellites, by 2026. But the company can begin commercial services with just a few hundred satellites, Limp said. He declined to discuss how much the service might cost consumers. \"We still have lots of work ahead, but the team has continued to hit milestone after milestone across every aspect of our satellite system,\" Limp said in a statement.Notably absent from the list of providers is Elon Musk's SpaceX. Though SpaceX has worked to  the commercial launch industry with its reusable rockets, Amazon's space-based internet business, called Project Kuiper, is expected to compete directly with SpaceX's own satellite internet business, Starlink. Starlink is  of Project Kuiper and other competitors, as the company has already deployed more than 2,000 satellites and signed on more than 145,000 customers around the world, SpaceX said in January. It's , however, for a space company to launch a satellite on a competitor's rocket. SpaceX notably inked a deal to launch satellites for , which is building yet another constellation of internet satellites in low-Earth orbit, the area of orbit extending out about 1,200 miles from the Earth's surface. (OneWeb made that agreement after its previous launch contract, which involved using Russian rockets, .) Bezos and Musk, however, are thought to have a particularly fraught relationship, with Musk often making his barbs for Bezos public on  and their companies engaging in tense competition for high-profile  and the US military. Amazon's Project Kuiper has been in . Federal regulators gave  for the company to launch its satellites in 2020, and few concrete updates have been shared since. Under the deal announced Tuesday, Arianespace, which has orbital rockets in operation but will plan to use its forthcoming Ariane 6 rocket for Project Kuiper launches, signed a deal for 18 missions.ULA got the lion's share of the deal, with plans for 38 launches. ULA will use its Vulcan Centaur rocket, which had been slated to fly in early 2022 but has been delayed by development hangups with the engines it will use — the BE-4 engine, which will be built by Bezos' Blue Origin. The Vulcan Centaur could fly for the first time .Blue Origin will also use the BE-4 for its New Glenn rocket, which is . Amazon signed a deal for 12 launches on that vehicle when it's ready to fly.",

        "content": "An additional 42 genes connected to the development of Alzheimer's disease have been uncovered in the largest study of genetic risk for Alzheimer's to date. \"This is a landmark study in the field of Alzheimer's research and is the culmination of 30 years' work,\" study co-author Julie Williams, center director at the UK Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University, said \"Lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and diet influence our development of Alzheimer's, and acting to address these now is a positive way of reducing risk ourselves,\" she added. \"However, 60-80% of disease risk is based on our genetics and therefore we must continue to seek out the biological causes and develop much-needed treatments for the millions of people affected worldwide.\"The previously unknown genes point to additional pathways for disease progression besides the well-known APOE e4 gene or the development of amyloid beta and tau, two hallmark proteins that build up in the brain with devastating results as Alzheimer's progresses. \"Creating an extensive list of Alzheimer's disease risk genes is like having the edge pieces of a puzzle put together, and while this work doesn't give us the full picture, it provides a valuable framework for future developments,\" said Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.A number of the newly discovered genes focus on very detailed reactions between proteins in the body that govern how inflammation and the immune system might damage brain cells, the study found.\"The new risk variants identified in the present study are significantly associated with progression\" to Alzheimer's disease, says the study, .The discovery will provide scientists with potential new targets for treatments, medications and lifestyle changes that might reduce the risk of the deadly brain disease, experts say.\"The future of Alzheimer's disease is precision medicine and prevention,\" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine. \"This paper gives us so many more tools in our toolbox to, eventually, more precisely target Alzheimer's disease,\" said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. The global study analyzed the genomes of 111,326 people with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's and compared those with genes from 677,663 cognitively healthy people. The genomes were supplied by clinics in over 15 members of the European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Nigeria, New Zealand, the UK and the United States.The study identified 75 genes that are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's, 33 of which were already known. It also confirmed years of research into the roles of amyloid beta and tau. Of the 42 new genes found to be connected to Alzheimer's, many clustered into several suspected but unconfirmed pathways for disease development. One such pathway is the body's immune system, designed to protect us from germ invaders.A number of genes were associated with an immune regulator called LUBAC, which the body needs to activate genes and prevent cell death. The study also found that microglia, immune cells in the brain that are tasked with \"taking out the trash\" -- clearing away damaged neurons -- play a key role in people with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. Some of the newly discovered genes may cause microglia to be less efficient, \"which could accelerate the disease,\" Williams said. Another key pathway, according to the study, involves genes associated with inflammation. The body uses inflammation as a defense mechanism to kill off pathogens, but it also plays a role in removing damaged cells. One protein that stood out in the study was tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is made by the immune system to regulate inflammation. The study found a cluster of genes associated with TNF, as it is called. Though the chemical's true role is to gather the body's defenses for a fight, it is also a culprit in many autoimmune diseases in which the body turns upon itself, such as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes. Additional complicated gene interactions were found by the study, all of which illustrate that \"Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disease, made up of different pathologies, and each person has their own road,\" Isaacson said. \"Clinicians always say, 'once you've seen one person with Alzheimer's, you've seen one person with Alzheimer's.' The disease presents differently and progresses differently in different people,\" he said.Another key insight of the study was that brain disorders such as Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may have the same underlying genetic basis: \"Taken as a whole, these data may thus emphasize a potential continuum between neurodegenerative diseases,\" the study said. \"The scientific and medical community view neurodegenerative disease processes as very different and distinct, and that's how we've been studying them for a long time,\" said Dr. Kellyann Niotis, a neurologist specializing in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease prevention at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian.\"This emphasizes that there may be a larger continuum between these disease processes than we really understood before,\" said Niotis, who was not involved in the study. \"Young people may have similar underlying genetic risks, and they might lead to Parkinson's in one person and Alzheimer's in the other,\" she said. \"In reality, it is less relevant. What matters is understanding that this is what is going wrong in their body, so let's start early and target this pathway.\"By generating this more complete picture of genetic risk -- which needs to be fleshed out and defined in future studies -- the study authors also developed \"a new scoring system to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease,\" Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement.\"This tool will be useful for researchers but will not likely be used any time soon for people who are not participating in clinical trials,\" said Spires-Jones, who was not involved in the study.Clinician researchers like Isaacson and Niotis know that a tool like that is precisely what patients want who are worried about their brain health.\"People want to know, 'what are my chances?' and then 'what can I do about it?' \" Isaacson said. \"Not today, but in the near future, we'll be able to calculate a person's likelihood of developing Alzheimer's or another brain disorder in a more precise way, and that will help with precision medical and lifestyle management.\"",

All 25 million residents are under lockdown, with national health care workers and the Chinese military dispatched to boost the city's response.On Tuesday, the country recorded more than 20,000 new cases -- far past the peak of Wuhan in 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. Though this number is still far lower than in many other countries, it's a dramatic spike for China, which has adhered to a strict zero-Covid strategy that aims to stamp out all outbreaks and chains of transmission using border controls, mass testing, quarantines and stringent lockdowns.The sustainability of that policy is now under question, as newer, highly-infectious Covid variants continue to spread throughout the population.Here's what you need to know about the latest outbreak.In early March, cases began rising in several provinces around the country including Shandong in the east, Guangdong in the south, and Jilin in the northeast.By the end of the month, the virus had spread to 29 of China's 31 provinces, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). 90% of all cases identified in March came from Jilin and Shanghai, the two largest hotspots. Several cities, collectively home to more than 37 million residents, were placed under varying levels of lockdown in March. Many of those lockdowns eased by early April -- leaving Shanghai the outlier, as authorities struggle to get its cases under control.So far, only two Covid deaths have been officially reported during this wave, both coming from Jilin in March.Shanghai's measures have been expanded and prolonged as the situation deteriorated. In late March, the Shanghai government denied it had any plans for a citywide lockdown -- even saying reports were \"untrue\" and disturbing \"social order.\" On March 27, the government announced it would launch a staggered lockdown, first targeting one half of the city, then the other half.By March 31, the government had abandoned its staggered approach, effectively imposing a citywide lockdown for all 25 million residents who were forbidden from leaving their neighborhoods except to get tested.The mandatory citywide testing detected a surge in cases, officials said -- prompting them to extend the lockdown until further notice while they \"test more, review results, transfer positive cases and analyze the overall Covid situation.\"To enforce these measures and meet the demands of the entire locked-down population, more than 30,000 medics and 2,000 military workers have been dispatched to the city, according to state media and the People's Liberation Army.But the restrictions have also seen a rare surge of public frustration and criticism toward the government, with residents describing challenges accessing basic supplies like food or medicine. Anger swelled last month after  in Shanghai died, after being turned away from an emergency ward at her own hospital that was closed for disinfection. Another Shanghai resident died after suffering a medical emergency in his home before being able to reach the hospital.\"We are not killed by Covid, but by the Covid control measures,\" noted one popular comment on the highly censored Chinese social media platform Weibo.There was also  over Shanghai's policy requiring all Covid-positive patients to be isolated in facilities -- even young children and babies. One mother told CNN she had been separated from her infected 2-year-old daughter on March 29, and was not allowed to enter the isolation ward to stay with her daughter until a week later.On Monday, one quarantine center in Shanghai launched a parent-child quarantine area. And on Wednesday, Shanghai health authorities announced they would amend the policy, allowing parents who test negative to apply for permission to accompany Covid-positive children with \"special needs.\" They did not specify what conditions would qualify as \"special needs.\"Parents who test positive can also accompany their Covid-positive children in quarantine facilities.Omicron has been driving this surge, with identified cases showing both BA.1 -- the original Omicron -- and other descendant lineages, including BA.1.1 and BA.2.BA.2, which was first detected in January, is now the main cause of Covid-19 globally and in the United States, according to the World Health Organization and US health authorities. Since its rise, international case counts -- which had been declining since the first week of January -- have been rising again.Studies also suggest BA.2 is far more contagious -- though researchers are still studying the severity of this variant. Some epidemiologists have said its basic reproduction number may be as high as 12, meaning each sick person infects an average of 12 others. That would put it on par with measles, which also spreads through the air. The basic reproduction number for BA.1 is estimated to be about 8.As the outbreak has stretched on, experts and international observers have speculated over whether this wave, the more transmissible variant, and China's mass vaccination campaign could bring about the end of zero-Covid.As of Friday, about 78% of the country's 1.4 billion population had been fully vaccinated, according to the NHC.Before the outbreak, scientists and leaders had hinted they were re-examining the strategy, with one prominent epidemiologist writing on Weibo in early March that zero-Covid would \"not remain unchanged forever.\"But that now looks like a distant future, with Chinese authorities making clear they consider the alternative -- the virus running rampant nationwide, potentially overwhelming the health system -- the worse option.Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Friday that China would \"continue to focus on dynamic zero-Covid policy,\" according to state-run tabloid Global Times. The loosening of restrictions and opening of borders seen in other countries could \"cause many problems such as (a squeeze on)medical resources and rising fatalities,\" he added.And on Monday, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said in Shanghai that the city needed \"a more determined attitude, more powerful actions, and more efficient coordination\" to achieve zero-Covid.",

The woman -- named by Israeli media as 43-year-old Fidaa Kiwan -- is appealing the sentence. In a statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said: \"The case is known and we are handling it through the consular service and our representatives in the Emirates.\" It declined to comment further. Israeli media reported that Kiwan, who owns a photography studio in Haifa in northern Israel, came to Dubai for work about a year ago. She was arrested a week later after police found the cocaine in the apartment she was staying in. Kiwan reportedly claimed the drugs weren't hers. CNN has reached out to the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. Death sentences are rarely carried out in the UAE. Ziv Agmon, an Israeli lawyer specializing in Emirati law, who isn't involved in this case, told CNN he expected the UAE's courts to commute the sentence. He added that there is no formal repatriation agreement between the UAE and Israel.The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE, as part of the Abraham Accords signed in 2020, has led to a surge in Israeli visitors to the UAE. Not all of them have been tourists and businesspeople. \"Our Dubai office noticed a rise in criminal cases that Israeli citizens are part of,\" said  Agmon. \"Israelis have to understand that the legal authorities in Dubai treat drug cases seriously.\" ",

        "content": "The Russian column of tanks and armored personnel carriers sped along a residential street in , a tree-lined suburb of the capital Kyiv. That was February 27th. A short time later, that same line of vehicles lay in ruins, the wreckage smoldering, after being ambushed by .  There was no sign of the column's soldiers. In a video showing the destruction, a man could be heard muttering: \"I wish you all to burn in hell.\" But that Ukrainian victory was to be short-lived; a month-long occupation of Bucha by Russian forces followed. The suburb's name has this week become a byword for, after accounts of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling emerged in the wake of Russia's hasty retreat, as the Kremlin shifts its focus away from the Ukrainian capital to the country's east. In recent days, Moscow has claimed -- without evidence -- that the atrocities in Bucha were staged -- calling it \"fake,\" and part of a \"planned media campaign.\"But witnesses who spoke to CNN said the carnage in the town began weeks ago. And the devastation there bears similarities to Russia's playbook in other towns and cities in , where officials say civilian infrastructure has come under attack -- with power supplies knocked out, water cut off and communications towers damaged -- making it harder for local residents to hold out against Russian troops. But Ukraine has not surrendered.There have also been reports of looting, disappearances, and evidence of the indiscriminate killings of civilians since the war began. Bucha -- once a magnet for young families due to its affordable homes, green spaces, and good schools -- and other areas nearby, turned into a living nightmare in March as Russian troops stormed the region. Residents there share difficult to verify stories of looted homes, senseless murders and failed escapes via Kyiv's Zhytomyr highway -- now a graveyard for wrecked tanks and burned-out cars.  In Bucha, pitch-roofed homes crumbled under the force of Russian artillery strikes. Residents say they had no choice but to turn their vegetable patches and front yards into makeshift graves, since the presence of Russian forces made it impossible to reach the morgue or local cemetery.Anna Bilous, 48, had lived in Bucha for eight years before the Russian troops arrived. She sheltered in her home with her husband and two sons, but around March 4, when the electricity cut out and the pipes ran dry, it became clear they had to leave, she told CNN. They decided that Bilous and her two sons would flee on foot, heading for the nearby suburb of Irpin on March 9, while her husband stayed behind to care for the family's elderly neighbors. The trio traveled on side roads to avoid the Russian soldiers, but when they turned onto Yablunska Street, the family was stunned to find dead bodies scattered across the road -- including one lifeless man collapsed under a bicycle.    Bilous believes the man's body remained there for close to a month, until he and some 20 other civilians were photographed for the world to see this past weekend. Bucha's mayor has described their deaths as an execution. Bilous' account and , shared by Maxar Technologies, show that the bodies had lain in the street for weeks, since the town was under Russian control --  held Bucha until March 31. On Tuesday, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov continued to deny the accusations of brutal civilian killings in Bucha, saying the claims are not only \"groundless, but are a well-staged tragic show\" and \"a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.\"About a mile away, at a sanatorium in Vokzal'na Street on Monday, Ukrainian officials ushered journalists into a cold basement where the contorted and bloodied bodies of five men lay in an advanced state of decay. Some of those in this dimly-lit space had been kneecapped. Others, their arms bound behind their backs, had been shot multiple times. Bullet casings littered the ground. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said it was a cruel display of torture and execution by Russian soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify his claim. The men were killed sometime in the last three weeks, officials say. Their bodies are as yet unidentified, since no personal documents have been found. In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied anyone was harmed.  \"Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake.\"Officials say Russian forces bedded down in the sanatorium around the second week of March. Several foxholes, trenches, and positions for armored vehicles remain visible around the site; leftover Russian rations have been abandoned nearby. Soldiers have daubed the exterior walls of the facility with the letter \"V,\" a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military District, and used as an emblem for Russia's \"special military operation.\"        The gruesome scene proved too much for Vladislav Minchenko, who vomited after volunteering to help remove the bodies from the basement on Monday.\"This is not what we learned in school,\" said Minchenko, 44, who worked as a painter before the war. Holding up his hands, Minchenko the number of dead bodies he had dealt with since the start of the conflict numbered in the \"hundreds -- not dozens -- hundreds.\"Shelling, live fire, and trigger-happy Russian soldiers made it too dangerous for those injured in the assault on Bucha to seek treatment at the local hospital in the center of town, according to residents. The local morgue in Bucha ran out of space as deaths mounted in March; to deal with all the bodies, a tractor was brought in to dig a mass grave in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, its abbot, Andriy Galavin told CNN.\"There were too many dead people, and there was no way to properly bury them because getting to the cemetery was simply unrealistic because of the shelling,\" Galavin said.  There was also a lack of resources, such as coffins, due to the main bridge connecting Bucha to Irpin being blown up at the start of the war, Galavin said.    As of this weekend, Kyiv Regional Police and residents believed the remains of at least 150 people had been laid to rest in the grave, but the mayor of Bucha said the death toll could be as high as 300. CNN could not independently verify those claims.Galavin returned to Bucha last week once the town was liberated; he said the plan was to exhume the bodies, identify them via DNA analysis and hopefully provide some solace to relatives still searching for missing loved ones. The devastation wrought in Bucha is just the tip of the iceberg, Ukrainian President Zelensky warned on Monday. \"In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago,\" President Zelensky said. \"The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this.\" One grisly example of the callous indifference for human life was found in Motyzhyn, a village around 20 miles south of Bucha. The local mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was discovered half-buried in a ditch alongside members of her family. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that she was killed after being captured by Russian forces.And, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says that  by the Russians, which CNN cannot verify. \"Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to get in touch or to free any other city mayors and we don't even know, we think that some of them were killed,\" she told CNN, promising that the perpetrators would pay for their crimes against Ukraine.\"We will find them and kill them, and we will punish everyone who killed our city mayors, our journalists, our priests, our activists.\"As Ukrainian officials race to clear mines and booby traps left by retreating Russian troops, they fear , 14 miles west of Bucha.Oksana Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr returned home to Borodyanka over the weekend after fleeing the area on February 27. They discovered that their house had been trashed and looted by Russian soldiers.The couple also found a dead man in their backyard. His arms were tied behind his back, and his trousers had been pulled down. \"Alcohol is everywhere. Empty bottles in the hallway, under things,\" Oksana said. \"They smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table... They lived here as they wished.\"Anna Bilous and her sons made it out of Bucha on March 10. But the fate of the dead man they saw lying beneath a bicycle as they fled still haunts her. \"I feel like me and my sons could be in the same place as the man who died,\" she said. \"I feel the pain and sadness of all these lost people.\" ",

Hopes that inflation would rapidly cool off have been dashed, in part because of the war in Ukraine. Inflationary pressures have broadened out, raising concern that the Fed will have to rapidly raise interest rates to get prices under control. Deutsche Bank pointed to how energy and food commodity prices have spiked since Russia invaded Ukraine.\"It is now clear that price stability...is likely to only be achieved through a restrictive monetary policy stance that meaningfully dents demand,\" the Deutsche Bank economists wrote.In other words, the Fed can't just tap the brakes on the economy.

Powell pointed to 1965, 1984 and 1994 as examples.However, the Fed chief also conceded there is no guarantee it will be able to pull off that feat this time.\"No one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context,\" Powell said, \"very little is straightforward in the current context.\"",
