        "content": "When Shirley Raines was  in New York City last December, she wasted no time bringing the honor back to her Skid Row community in Los Angeles.\"It's just a really amazing opportunity for the homeless to be seen, helped ... for people to understand what they're going through,\" she said. The founder of the non-profit , Raines provides hair and makeup services, food, clothing, hygiene and safety items to thousands of homeless people every week. She hopes the award will continue to garner attention for a community that is struggling and often overlooked.\"I think it's important to change the narrative of what people think Skid Row is about, to see the commonalities that we have,\" Raines said.Rain or shine, she sets up \"shop\" weekly at the corner of 5th and Towne to serve those she calls \"Kings\" and \"Queens.\" Her goal is to help them see themselves as worthy, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Raines says she knows how it feels to be labeled. For decades, she struggled with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her first son.\"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"After volunteering with a church group on Skid Row, Raines said it was the homeless community that helped her find purpose. \"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave.\"Early on, Raines began live-streaming her Beauty 2 the Streetz events on Instagram and Tik Tok and soon gathered a devoted social media following. She has more than 4 million followers on social media -- people who not only want to help but also follow her work and life. In times of need, Raines often appeals to them for donated tents and hygiene items.And in 2021, when Raines found out she was a Top 10 CNN Hero, she also encouraged her followers to vote for her for CNN Hero of the Year. \"As much as you want to say it doesn't really matter, let's be real. I wanted to bring that prize money, that win, that recognition to the community,\" she said. \"It felt really good to know that social media really rocked with us.\" Raines was presented with the award by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa and thanked the Skid Row community and her children, including her late son, who inspired her work.\"I wanted people to understand you are not looking at a woman who buried a child, who started a non-profit, got her life together, and now she's a CNN Hero winner,\" Raines said. \"You're looking at a woman who did all those things and remains very much broken, but yet is still a CNN Hero winner.\"Raines' organization received $100,000 to expand its work, and she says the money will be used for feeding programs. As homeless populations increase, she says they need support more than ever.  \"The work continues on,\" Raines said. \"But it's the hardest thing to get the support and help for. There's a massive need for tents (and) blankets down here.\"For those Raines serves, the honor and award have indeed been a win.\"It was like a team feeling,\" said Skid Row resident Michael Jackson who was featured in Raines' profile piece. \"Everyone was approaching me ... I was happy and proud just to know her. She's helped out more people than you can imagine.\"Despite the honor, Raines says she wants to stay grounded and doesn't think of herself as a hero.\"I don't do hero stuff, I do human stuff,\" she said. \"I work out here in the streets to gain the trust of my community. The world had that opportunity to vote for 10 amazing organizations. And they chose one that dealt with homelessness ... to them that might say, 'Oh my god. People really are paying attention. People really do care.'\"CNN's Dan Przygoda contributed to this story.",

        "content": "People around the globe have been moved by the horrible images of Ukrainians in distress, fleeing their homes after the Russian invasion began in late February. But the scope of the situation can be difficult to comprehend.More than a quarter of Ukraine's population has been uprooted since February 24 and more than 4.6 million people have left the country, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It's the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, the UN says.More than 4,500 miles away in Anchorage, Alaska, paramedic-turned-nurse Teresa Gray mobilized to help. Late last month, through her nonprofit , she and several volunteers traveled to Galati, Romania, where they provided care -- and comfort -- to hundreds of Ukrainians.\"These people have lost everything -- their homes, their family members, their country. I knew the hardships they're going through,\" Gray said. \"Because we've done this before, in other countries, I knew that we (could) make a difference for them.\"After creating her nonprofit six years ago, Gray has sent medical teams to natural disasters and refugee crises in the US and around the world. Her organization's work is all done by volunteers, with travel and supplies funded through donations and assistance from other nonprofits.Gray says the group has provided free medical care to more than 30,000 people on five continents. Gray specializes in sending small, mobile teams of four to eight licensed medical volunteers able to go into remote areas -- a need she recognized after working with other groups.\"There's amazing people doing amazing work out there, but they're very stationary. They come in, they set up, and patients come to them. I really saw a need for basically an ambulance-type response,\" she said.When her group members deploy, they're prepared to be entirely self-sustaining. This ensures that they can work for days at a time without taxing the local infrastructure.\"We can bring our own food, our own water, our own sleeping accommodations,\" she said. \"We try to take basically an ambulance in a backpack.\"When they deploy, it's normally within 72 hours of a disaster to fill the gap before larger groups are fully operational. Their missions typically last seven to 10 days.But the Ukraine crisis required a different type of response. Four days after the invasion, one of her volunteers from England began driving along the western border of Ukraine to assess where their help would be most needed. Eventually, they determined that Romania was overwhelmed by refugees but lacked infrastructure other countries, like Poland, had.Going to the border of a war zone raised other concerns.\"This is the most dangerous mission we've ever done,\" Gray told CNN prior to her departure from the US. \"We're taking the necessary medicine for chemical warfare, in case chemical weapons are deployed. But honestly, the heroes are my volunteers who were begging to go.\" Gray's team was told about hundreds of refugees on a university campus who had very limited medical care. When they arrived at the campus in Galati on March 26, Gray was surprised.\"What we were expecting to see was large groups of people housed in tent cities or in large buildings, and actually they are housing these refugees in individual dorm rooms,\" she said. \"They've got food, they've got shelter, but it's still a large group of refugees. The trauma is the same.\"Gray's team staffed a 24-hour clinic and went room to room, caring for the 300 refugees with the help of interpreters. The problems they treated ranged from a flu outbreak among the children to chronic health problems in the elderly, which posed a particular challenge.\"They now exist in a country that doesn't speak your language and doesn't use the same medicine,\" she said. \"So, we're trying to figure out what's your underlying condition, what medication were you on in Ukraine and what is the equivalent in Romania.\"The group also helped organize a warehouse of donated goods, delivered supplies, and cared for other nearby refugees. When one woman, whose elderly mother had been treated for health issues, asked for help -- Gray's volunteers literally went the extra mile.\"She asked us if we would drive her to the border so (she) and her son could see Ukraine, maybe for the last time,\" Gray said. \"She asked us for help, so we gave it to her. \"That interaction embodies Gray's approach to her work.\"It isn't just about fixing the broken arm or giving you medicine. It's making that human connection,\" she said. \"Human suffering has no borders. People are people ... and love is love. \"CNN's Kathleen Toner spoke with Gray about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.How did you find your way into the medical field? Growing up in Michigan, my godmother was a paramedic instructor, and she would drag me down to the firehouse and make me be a mock victim. I would have to be bandaged and splinted and all sorts of things while they practiced their skills. I loved it. After high school, I stumbled across an ad for an EMT, and I thought, \"I'll go give it a shot,\" and it all made sense to me. I knew in that moment I had found my career. I started as an EMT, became a paramedic. Eventually I moved to Alaska and ended up being a critical-care flight paramedic. Our cities are hundreds of miles apart, so our ambulances are Lear jets. We fly to the villages, pick people up and bring them back to major cities. I've picked up patients in dogsleds, on snow machines -- whatever we needed to do to make it happen, I've tried all the different avenues of paramedicine. I've loved them all. Now I'm a registered nurse, but I also still hold my paramedic license. What led you to get involved in disaster response work? In late 2015, I had semi-retired. I was a stay-at-home mom, and I was watching TV and I saw the  on the beach of Lesbos face down in the water. I had not really been aware of what was going on over in Greece or the Syrian refugee crisis. And so I just decided that I was going to go to Greece and see if I could help. It was life-changing. These people were stepping off the boats, soaking wet, hypothermic. It was heartbreaking. But I made a difference for people. In addition to natural and humanitarian disasters, your group also does medical sustainability missions.  We will find communities that are chronically medically underserved, and we ask them to commit five years to building their own medical infrastructure, and we support them during that time. We've done that with the Philippines very successfully. We normally go in twice a year and we give them the equipment, the supplies, the medications they need, and the ongoing training. And then we also mentor them and support them through telemedicine. When we first started going to a remote island in the Philippines, they had a huge population of cleft-palate babies being born, just simply because their nutrition wasn't good. Within three years, we eliminated cleft-palate babies on that island by giving out prenatal vitamins. That's all it took -- but that's what it took. So that's what we do. It doesn't matter what you need, if we can provide that for you, we will.To donate to Mobile Medics International via GoFundMe, ",

Atlanta and Minneapolis saw  in pollution, the report showed.\"The (United States') reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,\" the authors wrote.Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country's most vulnerable and marginalized communities. \"We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,\" said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. \"We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we're still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we're seeing in major cities.\"Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which  in July.   China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a  of polluting industries in the city.The report also found that the , which had acted as the world's major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year.  and  have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. \"This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.\" Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. \"When you don't have that data, you're really in the dark,\" Hammes said.Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country's air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\"I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,\" Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. \"However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.\"The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\"We've got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,\" she said. \"There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we're on (would be) irreversible.\"",

        "content": "Does the richest person on the planet need another massive pay package? That's the decision facing the Tesla board of directors.CEO Elon Musk . He's paid only with stock options. But he has just about exhausted the options available from the compensation package he , a package that turned out to be the most lucrative package of stock options issued by any company according to Courtney Yu, director of research at executive compensation firm Equilar. The 93.9 million options Musk has received so far from that package were worth $86.8 billion as of Friday's close, after taking into account the exercise price.Musk got 25.3 million of those options just this past week due to the  . He's likely to soon receive another 8.4 million options, probably after the company posts its second or third-quarter results, based on analysts' revenue forecasts for the company.  But those 8.4 million options, worth billions, are a relatively small portion of what Musk ultimately might receive. Once he gets those additional options, he will have received all 101 million split-adjusted options that were part of that 2018 pay package. The question should be whether he'll get even more options, perhaps tens of millions more options.Musk dodged a question about such a payday during an investor call Wednesday, saying simply, \"There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.\"But that doesn't mean he won't be offered that kind of payday in the future. Some tech billionaires have done just fine without stock options.   founder Jeff Bezos, who is the world's second-richest person, (, and   founder Mark Zuckerberg have received no stock grants or options since their companies' initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. They also have not earned much in the way of salary. Bezos got $81,000 a year in salary while he was CEO and Zuckerberg has taken home a salary of $1 a year for most of the last decade. They profited from the vast appreciation in value of the shares they have held since their companies went public. Much of Musk's net worth, estimated at , comes from the appreciation in Tesla shares. But he has also regularly received stock options as a form of compensation since 2009, the year before the company's IPO. He has exercised many of those options as they were due to expire. Virtually all his remaining options come from his2018 pay package.Many analysts believe it's only a matter of time before Tesla comes up with another package of options for Musk.Alex Potter, the analyst for Piper Sandler & Co. who asked Musk about a possible new compensation package on Wednesday's investor call, took a moment to say that the previous package \"seemed to work quite well.\" And 81% of Tesla shareholders who voted on Musk's pay package in 2018 approved of it. Other analysts believe a new package will be good for the company, as well as Musk.  \"Eventually the board will reload Elon's plan. And that plan will be massive, just like the last plan,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. \"Elon thinks big, and he has massive new markets to go after and build large businesses including autonomy and robots.\"Is there a public relations downside to lavishing the world's richest person with additional options that could add tens, if not hundreds of billions, to his wealth?\"Elon is the richest person in the world, and he still can appeal to hardworking people,\" Munsger said. \"Those people would largely cheer him on with a massive new comp package.\"A new options package for Musk could do much to assure investors worried that he might lose his focus on Tesla due to his CEO position with SpaceX or his interest \"It will make Tesla investors sleep better at night knowing he has a five- to 10-year comp package signed, sealed and delivered,\" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. It's tough to picture someone as wealthy as Musk, and as passionate as he is about Tesla, being motivated to spend more or less time on the company based on what he gets in his next compensation package.And if money is a motivating factor, the value of his current 265.5 million Tesla shares and options should provide all the incentive he needs.\"He's already financially motivated for Tesla to continue to do well,\" said Equilar's Yu.But advocates of a new package say it would answer many of the doubts about Musk's focus that have been swirling since he   .\"Even though his DNA is not going to change whether or not he has new Tesla options, the street is going to want him to have another comp package,\" said Ives.There are costs to Tesla involved in giving Musk additional options, even though it's non-cash compensation. The estimated accounting value of those options shows up as an expense in its earnings statement. Last year, Tesla booked $571 million in expenses related to Musk's 2018 pay package alone. If he doesn't get a new one, that expense will disappear from its profit and loss statement.And while a new package for Musk is sure to be criticized by those who believe executives are paid too much, Tesla shareholders, and no one else, will be making that decision. \"Musk is already either a hero or villain in eyes of people,\" said Ives. \"A new package is either going to cause people to hate him more, or be relieved he's staying put.\"",
