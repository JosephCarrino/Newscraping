        "subtitle": "In a historic first, a crew of four civilians are set to launch to the International Space Station this week as part of an inaugural mission for the commercial spaceflight company Axiom Space.",
        "content": "In a historic first, a crew of four civiliansare set to launch to the International Space Station this week as part of an inaugural mission for the commercial spaceflight company Axiom Space.They'll be riding on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and docking at the station via a SpaceX Dragon capsule, but don't get Axiom confused with Elon Musk's private spaceflight company. It serves a different purpose entirely. Axiom is less focused on building rockets than re-thinking the future of space stations. The four crew members -- three paying passengers and a former NASA astronaut there to serve as commander -- taking part in the mission, dubbed Ax-1, will taxi to the ISS via SpaceX vehicles as part of the 10-day trip. Axiom has arranged with NASA for them to spend eight days aboard the orbiting laboratory managed by a team of international government-backed agencies. While on the ISS, the civilians are slated to assist with more than two dozen scientific experiments, as well as help pave the way for the development of Axiom's plans to build the first commercial space station.Axiom, SpaceX and NASA announced Sunday evening that they are now targeting no earlier than Friday at 11:17 a.m. ET for the launch, which is set to lift off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If the launch goes as planned on Friday, docking of the SpaceX Dragon capsule to the station is scheduled for early Saturday morning. Those interested in watching the launch can tune in via NASA and Axiom Space's live coverage of the event on Friday morning. The commander of the first-ever private astronaut mission to the ISS is Axiom's Michael López-Alegría, a veteran Spanish-American NASA astronaut with four previous spaceflights under his belt, and who now has the professional title of Vice President of Business Development for Axiom. He will be joined by three fee-paying crewmates -- Larry Connor of the United States, Eytan Stibbe of Israel and Mark Pathy of Canada -- who each dished out to Axiom in order to take the journey into orbit. (Axiom did not publicly disclose the specific financial details of the trip.)Here is what you should know about the upcoming Axiom spaceflight, whichcomes as a handful of private companies are seeking to commercialize the space beyond our planet's surface. Axiom Space, the Houston-based company overseeing the entire mission, does not build launch vehicles or rockets like some of the other players in the emerging private spaceflight industry such as Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.The company arranges so-called \"private astronaut\" missions to the ISS, which includes seventeen weeks of training and custom itineraries based on the individual goals of those wealthy enough to afford the trip. Ax-1 is the company's first of these planned trips to the ISS, and late last year  Ax-2 is targeting to launch between fall 2022 and spring 2023. In addition to its human spaceflight services, Axiom also offers on its website opportunities for companies and individuals seeking to access space for research purposes. NASA uses the term \"\" to refer to \"missions that are privately funded, fully commercial spaceflights on a commercial launch vehicle for the purpose of enabling tourism, outreach, commercial research, and approved commercial and marketing activities on the space station.\" Referring to ultra-wealthy thrill seekers with the title of \"astronaut,\" however, has spurred  online in recent years. In January 2020, NASA selected Axiom to provide at least one habitable commercial module to be added to the ISS's Harmony node in 2024. Axiom said it has plans to have its module be ready to detach from the station by late 2028, and operate as the first building block of a private commercial space station. Axiom's lofty plans to build the first private space station and pioneer the commercialization of low-Earth orbit are what it sees as setting itself apart from others in the budding private space industry. The company even touts the Ax-1 mission as \"an important step toward Axiom's goal of constructing a private space station in low-Earth orbit that can serve as a global academic and commercial hub.\"Axiom CEO Michael Suffredini, a 30-year veteran of NASA who served as the ISS program manager from 2005 to 2015, described Ax-1 during a pre-launch news conference last week as a \"precursor mission\" to the company's plans of eventually assembling and launching its fully commercial space station in orbit. While Axiom is partnering with SpaceX to launch its private astronauts, \"SpaceX is just a taxi,\" John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs, told CNN Business of the role of Musk's company in this Axiom mission. Logsdon, who was the founder and longtime director of GW's Space Policy Institute, added that he sees Axiom's inaugural private astronaut mission as \"the first step in a process that could result in one or more private space stations doing a variety of things in low Earth orbit.\" \"We've had the International Space Station in orbit, with people aboard, since the year 2000,\" Logsdon added. \"NASA says it will de-orbit itin 2030 or so and turn over the use of low-Earth orbit to the private sector.\"Axiom Space \"is the first of the private sector ventures getting ready for that transition,\" according to Logsdon. He noted that construction of the first Axiom space station modules are already underway abroad, and it is slated to be shipped to Houston for final assembly next year ahead of their tentative launch in 2024. \"Like all entrepreneurial investments, there's a high risk of failure, but a possibility, a very real possibility, of success -- success in terms of economic payoffs from doing things in space,\" Logsdon said. In February 2021, Axiom said it raised some $130 million from investors, adding that the \"new financing will accelerate the growth of Axiom's workforce and construction of its privately developed space station.\"While private astronauts seeking to venture beyond Earth's surface can potentially strike a launch deal directly with SpaceX -- as billionaire Jared Isaacman did last year for his self-funded  -- Logsdon says the purpose of Axiom's mission is \"fundamentally different than Inspiration4.\"Logsdon said these trips are the first step in the process toward Axiom's primary goal of constructing a commercial space station to replace the ISS. The Inspiration4 mission was \"basically a tourist ride,\" he added.While it will likely be years before opportunities to visit a commercial space station become available to more than just the wealthy, Logsdon notes that a private space station could provide benefits beyond vacations for the rich -- especially if the ISS is retired as planned and scientists, engineers and other researchers look for alternatives. The privatization of human spaceflight is becoming an increasingly crowded sector amid the rise of a handful of space tourism ventures. However, Axiom CEO Suffredini said during last Friday's news conference that he thinks the company's plan of creating the first commercial space station -- and launching the first commercial module to be added onto the ISS in 2024 -- gives the company a novel \"business plan.\"\"We think it does put us in a good place relative to the competition, but we're happy that there are others that are going to help us grow the LEO [low-earth orbit] economy along the way,\" Suffredini said.Logsdon said he has been watching human spaceflight launches for decades and was at the Kennedy Space Center for the Apollo 11 launch that put the first humans on the moon back in 1969. While the private sector's foray into spaceflight has muddled some of the initial intrigue, he said he's still planning on tuning in for the launch. ",

        "content": "Have you ever cracked open a bottle of beer, poured it into a clear glass and left it outside sitting in the sun? Maybe you've come back to it after a while to take a sip -- and something isn't quite right.If you've experienced this funky taste, it's from a chemical compound similar to the stinky smell skunks produce. That's why the beer brewing community has dubbed this process \"skunking.\" Chuck Skypeck, the technical brewing projects director at the , has owned and operated craft breweries for 21 years. He said the cause of skunking wasn't really understood until around the 1960s.When hops in beer are exposed to strong light, a photooxidation reaction takes place, creating the compound 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. To prevent the process of skunking from occurring, beer brewers have opted for darkly tinted glass. It's why you see so many beers in brown glass bottles today.\"It's a simple reaction that creates what most people see as an undesirable flavor,\" Skypeck said. \"So, anything that shields the beer from that will preserve its flavor, so it is served as the brewer intends.\"Hence the popular choice among brewers: brown. But that's not the only color seen in beer bottles; some come in green glass, too. What's behind that choice? Given that green is not as protective from light, the reason for its use is mainly marketing, according to Skypeck.\"If you look to see what brands are in green glass, you're going to probably find mostly heritage brands that have been around for a while,\" he said. \"A fair amount of European brewers use green glass. Their green bottles are their image. And again, we're talking decades ago, there was a certain association of quality and uniqueness with green glass.\"And if that green glass wasn't tinted dark enough to prevent skunking, Skypeck said consumers back then might simply say, \"Oh, look, this tastes different. It's coming from Europe. It must be good.\"When it comes to choosing glass as the packaging material over plastic, Skypeck said not only is glass perceived as more environmentally friendly and looks higher quality to consumers, but it prevents the beer from becoming stale, as plastics let out the carbonation in beer and let in oxygen over time.Cans are also a popular choice for packaging and don't let in light, but skunking is still possible due to a process known as thermal aging. More studies are needed in this area, according to Skypeck, to  determine which packaging is optimal to prevent skunking.As for any other guidance on storing beer to prevent skunking, staling or any changes to the taste, Skypeck has a simple rule: cold and dark.\"Beer is basically water, barley, sometimes wheat, hops and yeast -- it's a food product. And just like any other food product, it's subject to losing its freshness,\" he said. \"What really causes any food product to lose its freshness -- besides this photochemical reaction we talked about -- is exposure to oxygen and exposure to (warmer) temperature.\"If you're ever up for a wasteful at-home experiment, place a beer in sunlight for a couple of hours, and you can taste skunking for yourself.",

        "content": "Taiwan plays a crucial role in making sure the world gets its cutting-edge technology devices, from laptops to advanced weapons, on time. That's because the self-governed democratic island of 24 million people is a  in the supply of semiconductor chips.But as tensions escalate between, the fate of that industry has become a global  concern. Experts have warned that any disruption to Taiwan's chip supply could paralyze production of key equipment, impacting almost everyone in the world.The island has been facing growing military aggression from China in recent months. In response, Taiwan has stepped up its own , and committed a record amount of defense spending this year. The advanced chips Taiwan makes are an indispensable part of everything from smartphones to washing machines.If conflict were to happen on the Taiwan Strait, \"it will be disastrous not only for Taiwan, not only for China, but also for the US, EU, and everyone else,\" said Roy Lee, a deputy executive director at Taiwan's Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research. The chaos in global automaking triggered by a pandemic-related shortage of chips over the past year gives a sense of just how bad it could get. \"With the auto shortage, now you have to wait for six months for European made cars,\" he added. \"If Taiwan stopped supplying chips for other products, then probably you have to wait for over 12 months for a new mobile phone, or even longer for a laptop.\" One Taiwanese company in particular — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — is the world's largest contract manufacturer of chips and plays a critical role in powering products designed by tech companies like Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia.With a market cap of nearly $500 billion, TSMC is one of Asia's most valuable companies, and accounts for 90% of the world's super-advanced chips,  said in a recent report citing industry estimates.The firm — widely dubbed in Taiwan as its \"sacred mountain\" — is so important to the island that its employees can apply to be exempted from  — even if they are called upon, the defense ministry .The company did not respond to a request for comment by CNN Business.Super-advanced semiconductor chips — like the ones produced by TSMC — are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated in just a handful of suppliers. The global semiconductor industry has already been under pressure because of a growing supply shortage, with many technology companies  in securing chips for their production activities. This makes Taiwan even more important, especially as the United States and China engage in a bitter rivalry over developing advanced technologies of the future, such as artificial intelligence and 5G. If Taiwan were to fall to the Communist authorities in Beijing, Western nations could potentially lose access to the island's valuable semiconductor chips.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has  about the risk that China could increase its military force against Taiwan. The Communist leadership in Beijing has long claimed the island as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.In recent months, China has stepped up its military pressure on Taiwan, including sending a record number of warplanes near it last October. Chinese President Xi Jinping has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what he called \"national reunification.\"But as comparisons are being drawn between Kyiv and Taipei, the Taiwanese government has repeatedly emphasized the strategic role of its semiconductor industry.\"Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in geopolitics, geography and the importance to international supply chains,\" President Tsai Ing-wen said as she condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. Last month, Taiwan announced it had begun imposing  against Russia. Authorities said major Taiwanese chipmakers, which account for more than half of the world's output of semiconductor chips, have all pledged to comply with the move.When asked about the differences between Taiwan and Ukraine, J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with Global Institute Taiwan said that the island's indispensable role in global supply chains, \"changes how countries — the international community — will calculate their response to the threat of, or the invasion against Taiwan.\"China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.While Taiwan's role as a leading semiconductor hub may be indispensable to the world right now, experts believe there are challenges for the island to keep up its advantage. The global supply shortage of chips has already prompted many countries to take steps to break their dependency on Taiwan.Last week, the US Senate passed a  plan to invest in the research, design and manufacturing of semiconductor chips in the United States.China's largest chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has pledged to invest  in extra capacity this year. \"Right now, China, US and the European Union are all pursuing the so-called next generation semiconductor technologies,\" Lee said.  \"We understand the challenges are coming, and we need to keep our leadership in semiconductors through research and development, and most importantly, cultivating qualified talents that support Taiwan's success,\" he added. In response to the challenges, Taiwan recently committed  to chip-focused graduate programs to train the next generation of semiconductor engineers. Last month, it also passed new  that requires those working in key tech roles to seek permission from authorities before visiting mainland China. As discussions about the future of Taiwan grow, Lee believes the best way to keep the island safe is via powering a combination of military and economic strength. \"That strength comes not only from military strength, but also economic strength.\" ",

        "content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has repeatedly pointed to the case of a family in the state's Leon County to explain the need for a controversial new law, dubbed by , that bans schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly to young children. On several occasions, DeSantis has highlighted the story of a woman named January Littlejohn, a registered Republican, who says she was not fully consulted about the school's gender-affirming plan for her child.  \"We had a mother from Leon County, and her daughter was going to school and some people in the school had decided that the daughter was really a boy and not a girl. So they changed the girl's name to a boy's name, had her dress like a boy and on doing all this stuff, without telling the mother or getting consent from the mother. First of all, they shouldn't be doing that at all. But to do these things behind the parents' back and to say that the parents should be shut out. That is wrong,\" DeSantis said during a news conference in Jasper, Florida, on Tuesday.  DeSantis had told the same story in Palm Beach County last Thursday. \"Her daughter was in school up in Leon County, and some of the people at school decided that her daughter was really a boy and wanted to identify as a boy. So they changed her name. They changed her quote pronouns. They did these things without telling the mother, much less getting the mother's consent,\" said DeSantis, who is considered a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate. In the past, the governor's office has confirmed Desantis is referring to Littlejohn when describing a Leon County mom who had issues with the way her child's school handle her child's gender identity.  Littlejohn did not respond to multiple requests from CNN about the emails, which show only one conversation in a much more complicated matter between a family and their child's school. Here's what we do know about the situation.  In an August 27, 2020, email to a teacher, Littlejohn stated, in part, \"This has been an incredibly difficult situation for our family and her father and I are trying to be as supportive as we can. She is currently identifying as non-binary. She would like to go by the new name [redacted] and prefers the pronouns they/them. We have not changed her name at home yet, but I told her if she wants to go by the name [redacted] with her teachers, I won't stop her.\" The teacher thanked Littlejohn and asked if she should share with other teachers. Littlejohn explained it was difficult and confusing, and went on to write, \"Whatever you think is best or [redacted] can handle it herself.\" In another email the same day, Littlejohn told the teacher, \"This gender situation has thrown us for a loop. I sincerely appreciate your support. I'm going to let her take the lead on this.\" But it's what followed these emails that is now at the center of a lawsuit. Nearly two months after the exchanges, Littlejohn and her husband, Jeffrey, filed a lawsuit against the Leon County School Board, as well as the district's superintendent and assistant superintendent, over how the district handled her child's gender identity. In the lawsuit, the parents claim school officials met with their child and created a Transgender/Gender Nonconforming Student Support Plan according to policy. In a copy of a blank student support plan filed with the lawsuit, the plan includes which pronouns the child preferred, which restrooms the child would use and \"expectations regarding rooming for any overnight trips.\" According to the Leon County Schools, \"less than 10 [students] in a district of 33,000\" have student support plans. Littlejohn claims that when she asked the school for more information, the school denied her access to meetings and information and tried to conceal information regarding her child. \"From the moment Mrs. Littlejohn first emailed her child's teacher to inform our staff of the situation, this has been handled together in partnership with clear communication. We understand that outside entities have now become involved, but the family clearly instructed the school staff via email to allow their child to 'take the lead on this' and to do 'whatever you think is the best,' \" Chris Petley, Leon County Schools communications coordinator, said in a statement to CNN. \"Additionally, our superintendent met with the family and committed to amend any vague or unclear policy language--of which we have created a committee and are working on currently. We truly hope for a swift outcome in this case in order to allow the student to continue to succeed in school.\" The parents hired attorneys from Child & Parental Rights Campaign, an organization based out of Georgia and Virginia, described on its website as \"a nonprofit public-interest law firm founded to defend parents' rights to shield their children from the impacts of gender identity ideology.\" Littlejohn did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Her attorney from Child & Parental Rights Campaign said she was not available for an interview. The spokesperson for DeSantis told CNN that the governor's office has not seen the email exchange but pointed out coverage from other news outlets that have reported the Leon County superintendent apologized for how the situation had been handled. \"In the initial meeting with the family the superintendent apologized for everything the family was going through,\" said Petley, the communications coordinator for the school system. \"He was unaware of the email directing the teachers to let the child 'take the lead.' \" The governor's office did not specifically respond to a question about the differences in what the mother's emails reveal and how the governor portrayed her story.

After Brainard spoke, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note hit its highest level in nearly three years, soaring to 2.56%.

They also accused Ethiopia's military of complicity in those acts.\"Since November 2020, Amhara officials and security forces have engaged in a relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing to force Tigrayans in western Tigray from their homes,\" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.Amhara government spokesman Gizachew Muluneh told Reuters the allegations of abuses and ethnic cleansing in western Tigray were \"lies\" and \"fabricated\" news.Ethiopia's government and military spokespeople, the former commander of Amhara's special forces and the administrator for western Tigray did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Amnesty and HRW said Tigrayan forces also committed abuses during the 17-month war, but that this was not the focus of the report.The report, which is based on 427 interviews with survivors, family members and witnesses, is the most comprehensive assessment to date of abuses during the war in western Tigray.Western Tigray has seen some of the worst violence in the war, which has pitted Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and its allies from the Amhara region against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's government before Abiy's rise to power in 2018.Both Amhara and Tigray claim the area, which is controlled by Amhara forces and the Ethiopian military.Besides repeated massacres, the report cited meetings in which Amhara officials discussed plans to remove Tigrayans and restrictions they imposed on the Tigrayan language as evidence of ethnic cleansing.Federal authorities failed to investigate allegations of ethnic cleansing, while the national army committed \"murder, arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture against the Tigrayan population\", the report said.The Amhara government spokesman Gizachew said regional forces had always respected the rule of law.Reuters could not independently verify details in the report.

Either action would constitute a , Fitch Ratings said last month.\"Significant amounts of our reserves are blocked in foreign countries, so if this blocking continues and these transfers are blocked from the blocked amounts, then they will be serviced in rubles,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a press conference Wednesday. \"If this is not possible, then, in theory, of course, a default situation can be organized.\"Peskov argued that a default would be \"artificial,\" because it has the dollars to pay -- it just can't access them. \"There are no grounds for a real default,\" Peskov said. \"Not even close.\"The United States is trying to  following images of  in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. In addition to the Treasury's decision to cut off Russia's access to dollars, the Biden administration on Wednesday announced  and individuals, including Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters and the wife and daughter of Russian Putin's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov.Treasury had been  to minimize the pain inflicted on the country's creditors. JPMorgan estimates that Russia had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors. But the images of civilians dead in the street in Bucha led Western countries to levy more sanctions and tighten the screws on Moscow even further.\"This will further deplete the resources Putin is using to continue his war against Ukraine and will cause more uncertainty and challenges for their financial system,\" a US Treasury Department spokesperson told CNN in a statement late Monday. Russia has been able to  by hiking interest rates, forcing exporters to swap foreign currency for Russian money and by demanding energy importers pay in rubles, among other actions. That has insulated Russia's economy somewhat from Western sanctions. But cutting off Russia from its dollars will almost certainly force it into a default. That could force Russia to make higher interest payments on its debt, if it chooses to pay.Russia last defaulted on its domestic debt when the country was plunged into a financial crisis by a collapse in commodity prices in 1998. Its most recent foreign currency default came in 1918 when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government.If the Russian government defaults, investors' losses could start to mount, although Western investors have less exposure to Russia than they used to. Sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 already encouraged them to reduce their exposure. But international banks are owed about $121 billion by Russian entities, according to the Bank for International Settlements.The interest payments due Wednesday come with a 30-day grace period. But credit ratings agencies could declare Russia to be in default before that period ends if Moscow makes clear that it does not intend to pay.",

        "content": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been far costlier and less successful than most analysts expected over its first six weeks -- and experts now believe that Moscow is President Vladimir Putin's revised war strategy will now focus on trying toand other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments.That makes the city of Sloviansk, more than 300 miles east of the capital Kyiv, a potentially crucial battleground in the coming weeks.\"Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izyum to capture Slovyansk will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine,\" the Washington DC-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its Monday update on the conflict in Ukraine. Its report uses alternative transliterations of Ukrainian place names.ISW expects Russian troops to begin offensive operations towards the city from nearby Izium in the coming days, a forecast that matches warnings on the ground.\"They go south to Kamyanka because it is the road to the city of Sloviansk,\" Max Strelnyk, a deputy in the Izium city council's office, told CNN late last week of Russian troops' plans. \"We have radio interceptions of their talks; their task is to capture the Donetsk region from the north.\"  On Wednesday, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Interior, said: \"If we talk about the key directions where combat will be ongoing -- it's the Sloviansk [Donetsk region] and Barvinkove [Kharkiv region] directions.\"Residents of Sloviansk, a city of just over 100,000 people before the invasion, are now being urged to evacuate, while Ukrainian forces are preparing to defend it from a new Russian onslaught.Control of the city has significant strategic importance in the wider conflict. Should Russian forces overrun Sloviansk, they would be able to cut off Ukraine's forces in the wider region. If they are held back by Ukrainian resistance, however, Russia's ambitions to control both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will suffer a huge blow.Sloviansk was  in the war in the Donbas region in 2014, and was briefly held by pro-Russian separatists before they were pushed back by Ukrainian forces in July of that year.Its significance now lies primarily in the fact that it is surrounded on three sides by Russian-held cities -- Izium to the north, Luhansk to the east, and Donetsk to the south -- but lies deeper west in the Donbas region than the two latter locations, blocking Russia's pathways further into Ukrainian territory.\"Russian forces likely intend to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and will need to take Slovyansk as their minimum step to do so,\" the ISW said. A successful Russian assault on the city would give Moscow the option to link troops up with those fighting in Rubizhne, to the northeast of Sloviansk, or move them south, towards Horlivka and Donetsk, in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian fighters there, the group added.But Russia appears to have encountered multiple military failures during the first six weeks of the invasion, and its inability to capture cities further west, such as the capital Kyiv, has likely prompted its renewed focus on the Donbas.In that context, a fresh Russian defeat in the face of Ukrainian resistance could imperil even their new strategy in the east.\"If Russian forces are unable to take Slovyansk at all, Russian frontal assaults in Donbas are unlikely to independently breakthrough Ukrainian defenses and Russia's campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail,\" the ISW said.Reinforced Russian troops currently driving from Izium towards Sloviansk are made up of elements from the 1st Guards Tank Army that had previously been in the Kharkiv-Sumy area to the north, the ISW said on Tuesday.They do not yet include the units that were withdrawn from the Kyiv region, the institute added. And, it said, the operation toward Sloviansk has \"continued on a small scale and made limited progress\" so far this week.But Russia may ramp up its assault on the city when more units become available. The citizens of Sloviansk were given an evacuation order on Monday, amid fears of a full-scale attack and an ensuing humanitarian catastrophe in the city. Such a fate has already descended on Izium, which has come under sustained Russian attack for weeks. On Monday a senior US defense official told reporters that Russian forces are \"still flying about more than 200 sorties a day,\" and \"most of their airstrikes are focusing on the Izium area.\"\"Every day, it gets worse,\" Strelnyk told CNN of the humanitarian situation in Izium on Friday.\"There's been no pause in the bombing -- it started weeks ago -- by the Russians. Although Russia claims that they will decrease military operations in the Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts, Izium and the greater Kharkiv region will have no such luck,\" Strelnyk said. \"In the city, the dead are buried in the central park of our city,\" he told CNN. Video footage that has been geolocated and had its authenticity verified by CNN showed dead bodies across the city's central park.  On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said major fighting was underway in Ukraine's east, with the regional military governor of eastern Luhansk region urging civilians to evacuate some towns. Sloviansk sits in the north of the bordering Donetsk region.But officials across the two regions have spoken of their difficulties in getting people out or aid in.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of attacking intended humanitarian corridors and bombing residents of cities as they fled.Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in the south, said Tuesday that Russian troops had been blocking the delivery of humanitarian supplies and hindering the evacuation of civilians. \"The situation with humanitarian corridors has not improved,\" Fedorov said in televised remarks. \"For the past two weeks, we managed to deliver only two humanitarian cargoes to Melitopol.\"CNN's Alex Stambaugh, Nathan Hodge, Yulia Kesaieva and Tim Lister contributed reporting.",

Once again missing star LeBron James through injury, the Lakers fell to a 121-110 loss to the Phoenix Suns. It's just the fourth time in James' 19-season career that he's failed to appear in the postseason. The 37-year-old was missing his second consecutive game after struggling with an ankle injury. Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters after the game that he was \"extremely disappointed\" after dropping out of playoff contention. \"Disappointed for our fan base,\" he added. \"Disappointed for the Buss family [owners], who gave us all this opportunity, and we want to play our part in bringing success to Laker basketball and we fell short.\"It had been a tight game in the early stages before the Suns stepped it up in the third quarter to establish a healthy lead. Devin Booker scored 32 points and made six three-pointers to hand the Western Conference leaders a franchise-record 63rd win of the season. Lakers guard Russell Westbrook scored 28 points and Anthony Davis registered 21 points, but it was all too little, too late for Los Angeles which has been hampered by a string of injuries this season. \"This year, we had more starting lineups than wins,\" Davis told reporters. \"Our goal was to win a championship ... I feel like we had the pieces, but injuries got in the way of that. And that was the difference in the season.\"",

Near her garden shed is the body of a man, lying face-down with a bag over his head and hands tied behind his back. His trousers are pulled down. There are large bruises on his left leg and a large wound on his head.Next to his body is a single bullet casing. \"He was executed, gunshot to the head,\" an officer with the Ukrainian National Police said. There are no documents on the man, but authorities on site say all indications show he was another civilian casualty of . The body is one of many recently found in cities to the east of Kyiv that were occupied by Russian forces.Borodianka was home to 13,000 people before the war, but most fled after Russia's invasion. What was left of the town, after intense shelling and devastating airstrikes, was then occupied by Russian forces, which moved in on February 28.Yuriy Pomin was still in town when the Russian attack started.\"The scariest part was when their planes came. They were flying above our house and dropping bombs,\" Pomin told CNN. Today, the 33-year-old is cleaning up his fourth-floor apartment. The multi-story building next to his was razed to the ground by a Russian strike, and he's moving what's left of his possessions to another house outside the city.\"I cannot stay here,\" he said. \"It's not safe.\"The month-long Russian occupation has left a devastating mark on the city.Not only was it almost entirely destroyed by long-range attacks -- with buildings reduced to mere piles of rubble -- but occupying Russian forces then used some of the houses as their own personnel barracks. Kostychenko and her husband Oleksandr fled when the shelling first began, only to return after the town came back into Ukrainian control on April 1.While their home was seemingly untouched by the heavy shelling that destroyed Borodianka, it was ransacked inside. Clothes and discarded bottles littered the floor. They found their pet bird dead in its cage. \"Alcohol is everywhere; empty bottles in the hallway, under things,\" the 44-year-old said. \"They (the Russians) smoked a lot, put out cigarettes on the table. They used the bed linen as their own.\"Most of the furniture was either damaged or destroyed, as was their TV. \"They did everything they wanted,\" Kostychenko said. \"Our jewels were taken away. They're nothing but looters.\"Nearby shops have also been pillaged, their windows broken and contents either stolen or splattered over the floors. The letter \"V,\" short for Vostok (meaning 'east' in Russian) -- and a symbol used by Russia's Eastern Military district in concert with  an emblem for Moscow's so-called \"special military operation\" -- was painted on buildings, vehicles and checkpoints. The local unemployment office and City Hall were fortified and turned into headquarters for Russian troops stationed in the town. Both were also covered in Vs. Borodianka was a jumping-off point for Russian units as they advanced on Kyiv through suburbs like Bucha and Irpin. They faced staunch resistance by Ukrainian forces and were forced to retreat.Remains of destroyed Russian hardware in the dozens now litters cities and towns around the capital, and fox holes and artillery positions were left almost untouched.Authorities have imposed a curfew in the entire Kyiv region until April 7, calling on residents to remain indoors while they conduct de-mining operations.Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but volunteers are working with police to pick up the bodies of killed civilians left to rot in the open air.  \"We are gathering people who were shot by the Russians. Civilians who were tortured. We have been working for two days,\" Hennadiy Avramenko, 45, said.CNN watched as Avramenko and his colleague extracted the body of a 44-year-old Ukrainian from a car. He was shot through the heart while driving, with his car crashing into a ditch next to the road.\"Psychologically, it's difficult,\" Avramenko said. \"The worst thing is that we're not finding soldiers, just innocent people.\"They were shot for no reason,\" he added.The volunteers pick up an additional two bodies in the space of an hour. One of them was the charred hit by an artillery round, the other an elderly man who was shot while riding his bicycle. \"(Monday) we picked up seven people and (by midday Tuesday) we're already at six,\" Avramenko said.  In and around Borodianka, authorities are only now starting to comb through what's left of most buildings, knowing they'll continue to find dead bodies as they do. Despite the withdrawal of Putin's army from their city, residents of Borodianka fear the destruction it sowed will linger for months, if not years. ",

Would have wished we wouldn't have given them the opportunity to come back in the game, but that's football, they deserved it, completely fine with that.\"It's an away game in the Champions League in the quarterfinal -- if that would be easy, something would be wrong with the competition, but it's a great competition. \"Benfica didn't get the quarterfinal as a present. They came through an incredibly tough group and played against one of the most talented teams in Europe with Ajax -- and here they are. Today, they really wanted to go for it and they will want to go for it [at Anfield].\"However, it wasn't all good news for Liverpool as Mo Salah's recent struggles in front of goal continued. The Egyptian forward, who has been Liverpool's talisman in recent seasons, once against drew a blank on Tuesday, meaning he's scored just once in his past seven games for the club -- and hasn't scored from open play since February.Rumors have been swirling around Salah's future with the club, with Liverpool reportedly yet to meet the player's wage demands, with his current contract set to expire in June 2023.The 29-year-old cut a frustrated figure as he trudged off after being substituted on the hour mark and Klopp admitted he is going through a \"tough period.\"\"I did nothing different to what I do usually,\" he said of substituting Salah. \"If the game is kind of decided, you are a bit more with the players who come off. If the game is open, like it was, then you just give a clap and about all the rest, we can speak later.\"Each player in that situation wants to score, and obviously with all the stories around, it's clear that Mo wants to score as well, especially in this moment. But it's all fine. It's a tough period, both boys [Salah and Mané] came back from Africa, it's really not easy.\"That's all, [it was an] important game for Mo and Sadio tonight. One could score, the other one unfortunately not, but everything will be fine.\"Elsewhere, Manchester City narrowly edged a 1-0 win at home in its quarterfinal first leg against Atlético Madrid.City was made to work hard against Diego Simeone's organized and resilient side, but Phil Foden's introduction in the 68th minute changed the game.It was the Englishman's link-up play with Kevin De Bruyne two minutes later that eventually broke the deadlock, as Foden threaded a wonderful through ball to the Belgian, who finished emphatically across Jan Oblak.It perhaps won't quite be the result Pep Guardiola was hoping for, but both sides will feel they have a real chance of progressing to the semifinals.

The letter did not make specific reference to government policies, but  has recently voiced her opposition to plans to liberalize certain prayer rules at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, as well as instructions to allow people to bring chametz -- food that is not kosher for Passover -- into hospitals during the upcoming Jewish holiday. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister, from whose Yamina party Silman hails, declined to comment. By contrast, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to congratulate Silman for her decision. In a , he said: \"I call on everyone that was chosen with the votes of the [right-wing and religious] national camp to join Idit and return to our home.\"It was not immediately clear what happens next. Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, says the government will only fall if there is majority support for the dissolution of the Knesset -- which is in recess until May 8 -- or if there is a majority in parliament in favor of an alternative to the current coalition.\"Neither avenue is guaranteed,\" he told CNN, noting that the coalition still holds 60 of the Knesset's 120 seats. Netanyahu's bloc holds just 54.There is \"zero\" chance, Plesner said, that the Joint List -- a mainly Arab party that holds six seats and is not part of any bloc -- would support Netanyahu. \"What we can be sure of is that the coalition and country is turning back to crisis mode,\" he said. \"But how this crisis will pan out is unclear.\"  The current coalition government was formed on June 13, 2021, after four elections were held in under two years. It comprises eight parties, spanning the spectrum of ideologies -- from the left-wing Meretz party, to New Hope and Yamina on the right. For the first time ever, it also includes an Arab party, the United Arab List.Under the terms of the coalition agreement, the leader of the government's largest party, current foreign minister Yair Lapid, is due to succeed Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in August 2023.",

Johnson made the comments while speaking on a number of issues, including the UK government's controversial decision not to include transgender people in the ban on \"And I also happen to think that women should have spaces, whether it's in hospitals or prisons or changing rooms or wherever, which are dedicated to women. That's as far as my thinking has developed on this issue.

It's vital that we give people the maximum possible love and support in making those decisions.\"But these are complex issues and I don't think they can be solved with one swift, easy piece of legislation.

CNN has reached out to Bridges directly but is yet to hear back.However, the Guardian reported the UCI prevented Bridges from competing because it said she was still registered as a male cyclist and therefore ineligible to compete as a female until her male UCI identification expired.\"I am an athlete, and I just want to race competitively again,\" Bridges' statement continued. \"No one should have to choose between being who they are, and participating in the sport that they love.\"As is no surprise with most of the British media, I've been relentlessly harassed and demonised by those who have a specific agenda to push. \"They attack anything that isn't the norm and print whatever is most likely to result in the highest engagement for their articles, and bring in advertising.\"This is without care for the wellbeing of individuals or marginalised groups, and others are left to pick up the pieces due to their actions.\"Bridges initially posted the statement on her Instagram account, but has since made the account private.",

Three of the 11 were declared innocent and the rest received prison terms of between three and 20 years.Compaore was found guilty of an attack on state security, complicity in murder and concealment of a corpse, the tribunal said in its ruling.He went on to rule for 27 years before being  and fleeing to Ivory Coast, where he is still believed to live.Sankara, who gained a reputation as Africa's \"Che Guevara,\" took power on a promise to thwart corruption and post-colonial influences, denouncing foreign aid as a control mechanism.He rolled out mass vaccination against polio, banned female circumcision and polygamy, and was one of the first African leaders to publicly recognize the growing AIDS epidemic as a threat for the continent.A former fighter pilot, Sankara won public support in the impoverished nation by selling a government fleet of Mercedes, lowering the pay of well-off public servants and forbidding first class state travel.He cut his own salary, refused to work with air conditioning and jogged through Ouagadougou unaccompanied.Critics say his reforms curtailed freedoms and did little to enrich ordinary people.

        "content": "Yemen's warring parties have agreed to a for the first time since 2016. Meant to last for two months but eligible for renewal, it is the step towards ending the hostilities since the war began seven years ago, and a win for United Nations and United States mediators who for the past year have been trying to engineer a permanent peace deal. The truce, agreed late last week, is meant to halt all military operations in Yemen and across its borders. It will also allow  into rebel-held areas, as well as allow certain flights to operate from Sana'a airport,  to the UN envoy. The Yemen war has been described as the world's  humanitarian crisis. Seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the conflict is fought between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Houthi rebel group, which is backed by Tehran. Both countries have welcomed the ceasefire. \"I think it's very interesting that you have both of these countries, who have struggled in their own relationship, both welcoming this important development,\" US special envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking told CNN's Becky Anderson on Tuesday, adding that Iran's support for the truce gives it an opportunity to follow through with efforts to deescalate regional conflicts. \"My hope is that with the steps of the last couple of days, we're turning a corner,\" he said.  CNN spoke to Peter Salisbury, senior Yemen analyst at International Crisis Group, about what the latest truce means for the war.  The main difference with previous ceasefires is that it is time-bound — it is scheduled to last two months — and is not yet tied to a broader initiative beyond limited aims of letting fuel ships into Hodeidah port, reopening Sana'a airport to a small number of flights, and initiating talks over road access to the besieged city of Taiz. This is the first nationwide truce since the period around peace talks in Kuwait in 2016. The Houthis and the Saudis directly oversaw a de-escalation of fighting in 2019. And of course, the UN negotiated a ceasefire around Hodeidah city in 2018.   The best-case scenario for the truce (which it should be noted is an informal and effectively self-policing agreement, unlike the Hodeidah ceasefire, which was at least partially monitored by the UN) is that it leads to the kind of holding pattern we saw around Hodeidah: sporadic fighting, shelling, and airstrikes, but nothing the parties consider a total violation, and significant shift in territorial control. There is of course going to be a lot of speculation about ties to the Iran deal, but I am yet to see any clear-cut evidence of links between the two. In reality, shifts in the internal conflict and the cross-border war between the Houthis and the Saudis — which saw the Houthis with missiles and drones in January and February — seem to have played the bigger role. UAE-aligned forces took back territory from the Houthis in January and significantly complicated their efforts to take Marib city and governorate by force. The Houthis responded with a fresh  on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. For the time being at least, it's clear that the status quo doesn't work to the Houthis' or the Saudis' benefit, so they might as well give a truce a shot.  Given the Gulf-led talks going on in Riyadh, I think this is a broader question. The Saudis, with Gulf support, appear to be working to recalibrate the makeup of the [President Abdu Rabu Mansour] Hadi government to include a much wider array of factions. That would dilute Hadi's role and influence in politics. The truce creates more space for this to happen and was allegedly pushed on the government by the Saudis. So, I suspect Hadi is not happy. In the country's strongest denunciation yet of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Israel's foreign minister Yair Lapid described the killings in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, as \"war crimes.\"   Israel's government was dealt a major blow on Wednesday when coalition chairwoman Idit Silman resigned, depriving the government of its majority. She called for a right-wing government to be formed instead. Turkey and the United States on Monday  the culmination of months of talks to set up a procedure for improving their strained ties, eyeing cooperation in the areas of economy and defense. Ministerial discussions will follow. Egypt is airing its third season of the Ramadan series \"The Choice,\" a re-enactment of the state's narrative of the 2011 Arab Spring revolution in Egypt and the events that followed. Less than a week into the Muslim holy month, it has already become the subject of a social media debate on state narratives versus reality. Written by Egyptian screenwriter Hani Sarhan, the show features several famed Egyptian actors, with Yasser Galal taking on the role of then-defense minister and current president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The show has been trending on Egyptian social media since its release on April 1, with many using the Arabic hashtag #TheChoice3 and noting the accuracy with which Galal's voice and demeanor mirror those of the president. Others have been much less generous. Egyptian state-backed media has praised Galal's performance as Sisi,  \"who saved Egypt from the destructive plans of Muslim Brotherhood.\"  The Muslim Brotherhood is the country's oldest and most organized Islamist movement. Authorities have repeatedly accused it of promoting militancy and subversion, a charge it has denied.  One of its members, Islamist ex-president Mohamed Morsi became the first democratically elected head of state in Egypt's modern history after protesters ousted longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak.  Morsi was toppled by Egypt's military in July 2013 in a . He died in prison in 2019 while on trial for espionage charges. Countering the tweets of admiration were furious voices arguing that the show's portrayal of Egypt's recent history is far from accurate. \"They will never know how to rewrite the history we saw with our own eyes,\" said exiled Egyptian actor Amr Waked on , without saying what the historical distortion was.  Many in Egypt see 2013 as the beginning of a sweeping crackdown where freedom of speech and the right to protest were significantly curtailed. The government has denied the accusations.  ",

        "content": "He strode into the sprawling domed arena on the fringes of Paris to the cheers of a crowd of 30,000; like a prize fighter arriving to defend his title before an adoring audience. Mounting the vast white stage, thousands of light sticks glimmering from the blackness in the crowd, French President Emmanuel Macron was in his element. This was his moment. And for two hours on Saturday, he held his supporters spellbound with a recitation of his accomplishments of the last five years, his hopes and dreams for a second term.For much of France's four-month-long presidential race, Macron looked like a shoo-in to become the first French president in 20 years to win reelection. Now his lead isn't quite so comfortable.Suddenly, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally, on her third attempt for the presidency, is surging in the polls and Macron looks worried.  show the margin between the two candidates narrowing to just 5% of votes. But most troubling are  that as many as 30% of the electorate may simply stay home on Sunday during the first round of the French presidential election. The top two candidates here will later face off in the final runoff on April 24.  While Macron has remained in the lead throughout his election campaign, the candidate most likely to face him has been less obvious. Early on in the race, three women from the principal axes of the political spectrum were vying to become They were Anne Hidalgo for the center-left Socialists; Valérie Pécresse for the center-right Republicans; and Le Pen. The first two faded sharply in , threatening to also  the two parties they represent that have been the staples of French politics for much of the post-Second World War era. Only Le Pen has essentially been left standing. And she is the focus of media attention and the fears of Macron's camp. Macron's early assurance began to turn when the Ukraine crisis erupted at the very moment France was assuming the rotating six-month leadership of the European Union. Macron had quite rightly painted himself as the , an irreplaceable figure who could hold the Kremlin at bay or at least serve as the one reliable avenue into the mind of the Russian dictator.Macron had hoped to coast into a second term in that role, remaking Europe in the French image and himself as its powerful, focused leader in the wake of the retirement of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. None of this worked out quite as he'd hoped. Instead, Europe has been plunged into the worst conflict on its continent since the Second World War. Macron, first in Herculean efforts to avert a Russian invasion, then equally energy-consuming attempts to unite Europe behind sanctions while seeking some route to a ceasefire, diverted his attention for crucial weeks as the presidential campaign built to a crescendo -- all largely in his absence. Meanwhile, back home, Le Pen was quietly focusing her efforts on the pocketbook issues that French families care about most deeply -- especially inflation, now passing , more than triple the level a year ago. Without suggesting how she'd pay for this, Le Pen  to 5.5% from the current 20% (zero for essentials like pasta and diapers) and no income tax for anyone under 30. But  is Le Pen's long-standing flirtations with Putin's regime and campaign loans from Russian banks. Not to mention her  that France might do better outside the European Union or even NATO. Certainly, Macron did not entirely misread the concern of French voters over Russian atrocities in Ukraine. But in the mind of most French these are still a distant second behindIndeed an in France's leading Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche this weekend outlined \"The 10 plagues that menace Emmanuel Macron\" -- No.1 being inflation. But also high on the list, is the President's continued flirtation with the third rail of French politics -- raising the retirement age to 65 years. When Macron first floated this nearly four years ago, the very idea sent hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into streets across France -- the \"yellow vest\" movement that nearly destroyed Macron's first term. Undeterred, he's raised the issue again in this year's . Le Pen meanwhile, wants to drop the retirement age to 60 from 62.With the countdown on to election day, Macron has refused to take part in any televised debate with the 11 other candidates standing against him in the first round on Sunday. Though he has agreed to debate one-on-one with whoever might be the other candidate in the second round two weeks later.Still, if there is one very important constant in French politics, it's voters' deeply held views of history, especially their own. The Nazi occupation of France is still very much part of the nation's DNA, even with few alive today who directly experienced these horrors. The thought of returning to a hard-right regime again is anathema to many.  Time and again, the French have refused to turn their country over to any individual too far out of the mainstream. Le Pen lost five years ago to Macron in the second round. Just as her father Jean-Marie Le Pen did in 2002, losing in an 82% to 18% against Jacques Chirac, one of five times Le Pen ran under the far-right National Front banner. The French, despite their constant flirtation with extremes, invariably penalize any politician who veers dramatically from the mainstream, promising revolutionary change. So this year's leading left-wing candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has suggested  entirely, still languishes in fourth place in polls. In the end, Macron should be counting on one fundamental difference between French and American democracy. In France, the presidential candidate with the largest number of votes wins -- there is no electoral college. Macron understands this, which is why in his declarations at his rally last Saturday and various campaign appearances, he has been trying his best to scrape votes from the far-left and far-right, knowing only one of them will be in the final runoff. Effectively, he is running a second-round campaign before the first is even finished. In the end, why should Americans or anyone outside of France care so deeply about this?  Because if any of Macron's most vigorous challengers from the left or right wins, the very foundations of western democracy risk being shaken to the core -- as profoundly as Donald Trump ever did. Le Pen really does want Frexit (exit from the EU), and France out of NATO. The question is how many French will want to risk that, particularly with a war virtually on their doorstep. ",

Domestic car models like the AvtoVAZ-owned Lada — an icon of Soviet-era self-reliance — could, in theory, stand to benefit from the absence of foreign competition.

The company says it is also designing new versions of several Lada models to be less reliant on imported parts.Chinese carmakers could capitalize on the departure of Western brands, said Carol Thomas, central and eastern European analyst at consultancy LMC Automotive.\"Chinese brands will no doubt see the current situation as an opportunity and there is a chance more will look to establish a Russian production base in the future,\" she said.

        "content": "The year 2012 called and and ex-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- two old rivals who waged a tough election campaign that year -- are creating a fleeting vision of what even a marginally functioning Washington might look like.Obama made his first post-presidential trip to the White House Tuesday and showed he'd not lost a political step, telling demoralized Democrats -- worried about a possible midterm election shellacking -- to buck up and remember what political power is for.Meanwhile, Romney -- now a Utah senator -- is suddenly turning into an old school Capitol Hill powerbroker.  and vote for Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson based on the throwback rationale that she's qualified. Romney is also in the thick of a bid  for which he's earned some rare praise from the White House.\"It feels like the good old days,\"  of the White House, where cheers for Obama lifted the gloom of Democrats at an event promoting the current White House's expansionBut as much as anyone might want to believe it, with Russia's atrocities in Ukraine and the Republican Party fully signed up to ex-President Donald Trump's democracy threatening authoritarianism, the good old days are far from back -- and they weren't that great anyway, as anyone who remembers the fierce feuds over passing Obamacare and government shutdowns of that era will remember. Still, if things were bad back then, they are indisputably worse now. Misinformation, conspiracy theories, lies, culture wars and barely concealed racism now dominate Washington -- and, judging by recent events, are seen by an increasing number of lawmakers as a ladder to power. Obama is set to speak about misinformation in a Chicago speech on Wednesday.On Tuesday, Trump acolyte Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida berated Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, warning that the chaos of the Afghan withdrawal and Russia's invasion of Ukraine happened because the US military studied \"wokeism\" instead of strategy. were a classic example of a new breed of lawmaker who uses their platform to create viral media moments designed to animate the unhinged theories of conservative news, rather than to build a legislative career.His outburst came in a week when Republican senators re-upped their slander of Jackson, painting her as an enabler of sex offenders, despite a sentencing record as a judge that is well within the mainstream. While she's almost certain to be confirmed, Jackson's treatment highlighted how the process of installing a new associate justice on the Supreme Court has become a vicious political play for base voters.Proving that the bar can always be lowered in Washington, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton -- one of several senators who used the Jackson hearings to highlight his potential presidential ambitions -- suggested the first Black woman nominated to serve on the nation's top bench would have been lenient on Nazis. In a Senate speech, Cotton referenced former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson who was the top prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials of Adolf Hitler's subordinates after World War II. \"You know, the last Judge Jackson left the Supreme Court to go to Nuremberg and prosecute the case against the Nazis. This Judge Jackson might have gone there to defend them,\" Cotton said. Washington is meanwhile  triggered by Republican North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn's claim he was invited to an orgy and saw leaders in the nation's anti-drug fight snorting cocaine. The House GOP declined to censure members for attending white supremacist rallies or for whitewashing Trump's coup attempt from history. But it did draw the line at Cawthorn. The congressman earned a rebuke because he embarrassed his colleagues in front of their constituents.In another sign of its twisted sense of right and wrong, the House GOP is already threatening to use its possible new majority next year to kill the Select Committee probing a far greater transgression, Trump's incitement of the Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021.Obama was not the only White House powerbroker back on Washington's center stage on Tuesday.  to the House committee, as members try to establish how much she knows about her father's thwarting of the US tradition of peaceful transfers of power.That a former first daughter's appearance before such a body is now considered perfectly routine is a sign of how mind-bogglingly warped Washington has become.Obama got . It had been more than five years since he walked out the front door under the North Portico. There was never a chance that Trump would have had him back for the traditional unveiling of a former president's portrait. And given Trump's racist birtherism campaign against his predecessor, there's even less of a chance that Obama would have shown up to any such event.Obama, instantly at ease back behind the presidential seal on Biden's podium, gently mocked his former vice president over his aviator sunglasses and love of ice cream. He began his speech by addressing his host as \"Vice President Biden\" before quickly correcting himself, saying, \"That was a joke!\" But two people close to Obama later told CNN's Jeff Zeleny it had been a slip of the tongue, and not how Obama had intended to begin his remarks touting the legacy of the Affordable Care Act.He recalled the struggles the pair had fought together to finally pass the Affordable Care Act, which secured health insurance for millions of Americans for the first time after it was signed into law in 2010.Obama used that experience as a parable to urge Democrats not to give up on reform -- even if it falls short of initial aspirations. \"I'm outside the arena, and I know how discouraged people can get with Washington --  Democrats, Republicans, independents,\" Obama said. \"Progress feels way too slow sometimes. Victories are often incomplete. And in a country as big and as diverse as ours, consensus never comes easily.\"The ex-President seemed to be talking directly to his party, which has been riven by divides among progressives and moderates that have stalled Biden's ambitious social spending and climate change plan. As was often the case while he was president, Obama's eloquence framed the choices for his party in simple but compelling language as he laid out a mission statement for the midterms.\"But what the Affordable Care Act shows is that if you are driven by the core idea that, together, we can improve the lives of this generation and the next,\" Obama said. He added, \"If you're persistent -- if you stay with it and are willing to work through the obstacles and the criticism and continually improve where you fall short, you can make America better. You can have an impact on millions of lives.\"Obama's faith in the American system seemed a little archaic at a time when that democracy is under mortal threat from Trump's lies about election fraud -- and the ex-President's apparent new campaign for a second term that would surely be even more authoritarian and unhinged than his first.Yet Obama also had the luxury Tuesday of walking out of the White House and taking off the tie he said he now rarely wears. The presidential burden of responding to Vladimir Putin's atrocities, the raging tempest of rising inflation and a likely midterm election hammering by Republicans, now rests with Biden.When Romney was running to deprive Obama of a second White House term in 2012, Democrats lambasted the Republican nominee and former venture capitalist as a heartless corporate raider with no soul. Now, he might just be their best Republican friend in Washington -- and the fact that in the space of 10 years he could go from leading his party to being a dissident from its Trump-era extremism shows just how much the GOP has changed.In his own way, Romney is also standing up for a functional brand of politics.  recalled a time -- not too long ago -- when presidents could expect broad support for their Supreme Court nominees. But the process has become so politicized that's no longer the case. Democrats and Republicans argue about who put ideology at the center of the process. But it has now become the primary driver of confirmation hearings.Romney -- whom no one would mistake for a liberal -- explained that after spending time with Jackson, he changed his mind about her ahead of her expected confirmation vote in the Senate this week.\"I became convinced that she's within the mainstream. She's also a highly qualified, intelligent, capable person,\" Romney told reporters. He said that while he doesn't expect to agree with Jackson on everything, he will join Republicans Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Liza Murkowski of Alaska in supporting her nomination.Romney also delivered another gift to the White House this week. He is leading a compromise drive to secure $10 billion in funds for a new Covid-19 relief plan that the White House believes is needed to stave off any future wave of the virus. The plan strips funding for global vaccination drives that could snuff out future variants. But Romney is the administration's best hope for getting the Republican support that would be needed to force any eventual deal through the Senate. Like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the former GOP nominee is also one of the few in his party to call out Trump's extremism, in the knowledge that he is ostracizing himself from his own party.Romney has  that Russia was America's No. 1 \"geopolitical foe.\"Obama's swipe at his rival in a presidential debate that \"the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back\" dripped with sarcasm. But subsequent events, especially the invasion of Ukraine, showed that Moscow remains a top US adversary.Romney's corporate conservatism and rich man's ethos were fair game for the Obama campaign in rough and tumble politics a decade ago.But the moral courage that Romney is demonstrating late in his career is showing that the caricature Democrats created of a man without a soul was deeply unfair.",

        "content": "Australia will spend $2.6 billion (3.5 billion Australian dollars) to upgrade its defensive missiles as the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region becomes more challenging due to China's assertiveness, the country's defense minister said Tuesday.The plan -- which will significantly increase the range of missiles on Australia's warships and warplanes -- comes as Australia said it will participate in developing hypersonic missiles with the United States and the United Kingdom as part of the AUKUS deal the three countries signed last year to build nuclear-powered submarines for Canberra.\"When you see what's happening in the Ukraine, when you see what potential there is for conflict in the Indo-Pacific, this is very real for us now and we need to be realistic how we're going to deter any act of aggression and to help keep peace in our own region,\" Defense Minister Peter Dutton said of the naval and air force missiles in an interview with Sky News on Tuesday.A news release from Dutton's office said Canberra would speed up its acquisition of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) Extended Range for use on its F/A-18 and eventually F-35A fighter jets, the Naval Strike Missile for its frigates and destroyers, and naval mines to protect its ports and maritime approaches.The new missiles are expected to be operational by 2024, the Defense Ministry statement said.With the JASSM Extended Range -- a US-designed air-launched cruise missile with stealthy characteristics and the ability to make course corrections in flight -- Australian warplanes would be able to engage targets at a range of 900 kilometers (560 miles), Dutton said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Norwegian-designed  is a maneuverable sea-skimming weapon that can hit targets from a range of 185 kilometers (115 miles) -- more than double the current range of the missiles on Australia's ships, the statement said.\"Our ADF (Australian Defense Force) must be able to hold potential adversary forces and infrastructure at risk from a greater distance,\" Dutton said.Both missiles are used by the US military, and Dutton said their integration into the Australian forces would help Canberra contribute to coalition operations in the Pacific.The Australian defense minister said increasing Chinese military activity in the Indo-Pacific is the impetus behind Canberra's upgraded missile program.\"We're frankly very worried\" about Chinese militarization of islands in the South China Sea and the increased Chinese naval presence near Japanese waters in the East China Sea, Dutton told Sky News.\"We don't want to see any bullying from China, we don't want to see any aggression toward Taiwan,\" he said, talking about the democratically ruled island that China claims as its sovereign territory and has vowed to regain control of.Dutton last month criticized a draft , northeast of Australia in the Coral Sea, as opening the possibility of Beijing expanding its military presence in the region. The Solomon Islands has denied any deal would lead to a Chinese military base there.The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said Canberra and its partners in London and Washington were the ones stoking tensions in the region.\"The trilateral security partnership between the United States and Australia is an old trick of the Anglo-Saxon clique, which cannot eliminate the Cold War mentality and bloc politics, provoking military confrontation and throwing knives at others,\" spokesman Wang Wenbin said.Wang was specifically reacting to Australia's announcement Tuesday that it will help develop hypersonic missiles and undersea drones in conjunction with the US and the UK.Wang said Australia and its partners are intensifying the arms race in the region, adding \"Asia-Pacific countries should be on high alert.\"Hypersonic missiles are weapons that can fly five times faster than the speed of sound. While almost all ballistic missiles reach that speed or more, the newest hypersonics and those under development are maneuverable and able to evade missile defense systems. , ,  and the  claim to have tested this new variety of hypersonic missiles.An AUKUS statement did not give any timeline or specifics on development of the missiles.But for undersea drones, it said trials would come in the near future.\"Our nations are collaborating on autonomous underwater vehicles, which will be a significant force multiplier for our maritime forces. Initial trials and experimentation of this capability are planned for 2023,\" said the joint statement from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden.In that statement, the AUKUS leaders pointed to the current  as underscoring the importance of their partnership.\"The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, and more broadly to an international system that respects human rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes free from coercion -- a commitment whose importance has only grown in response to Russia's unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful invasion of Ukraine,\" the statement said.Besides the hypersonics and undersea drones, the AUKUS leaders noted progress on the plan to equip the Australian navy with nuclear-powered submarines, including technology transfers to Canberra, developing a workforce to build the subs in Australia, and establishing a base for them.No deadline was given for the eventual delivery of the submarines, with the statement saying the plan was to provide Australia with them \"at the earliest possible date.\" CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

But a starkly different narrative is playing out on China's state-run media. There, domestic media reports on the  have been quick to emphasize the Russian rebuttal, with two prominent televised reports from national broadcaster CCTV this week highlighting unsubstantiated claims from Moscow that the situation was staged after Russian forces withdrew from the area.In one report, a caption citing Russia with the words \"Ukrainians directed a good show,\" flashes over heavily blurred footage from the Ukrainian town.There is no evidence to suggest this is the case. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18, while eyewitnesses have said the .Separately, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Tuesday said the shocking images from Bucha showed \"all the signs\" that civilians were \"directly targeted and directly killed.\" On Tuesday, UN chief António Guterres added to growing international calls for a war crimes investigation into the killing of civilians in the town.The allegations of war crimes raise the stakes for China's position. Beijing's apparent boosting of Russian propaganda is consistent with its stance as it refuses to condemn Russia-- at home or in its diplomacy -- even as the civilian death toll grows. Instead, Beijing has sought to portray itself as a neutral actor, calling for peace while . This was on show in an editorial published in the nationalist tabloid the Global Times on Wednesday, which appeared to question the veracity of what it called, in quotes, the \"Bucha incident\" and absolve Russia of responsibility.\"It is regrettable that after the exposure of the 'Bucha incident,' the US, the initiator of the Ukraine crisis, has not shown any signs of urging peace and promoting talks, but is ready to exacerbate the Russia-Ukraine tensions,\"  the editorial said.\"No matter how the 'Bucha incident' took place, no one can deny at least one thing: War itself is the main culprit of the humanitarian disaster,\" it added.Rising tensions with the US have driven Moscow and Beijing closer in recent years, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declaring their countries' partnership had \"no limits\" just weeks before Russia's invasion.Since Russia's invasion, Beijing has  to decry Russia's actions and join countries around the world in imposing sanctions. Chinese officials have instead refused to use the term invasion to describe Russia's actions, and have repeatedly said they will cut their own path when it comes to their response. At a UN Security Council special session on Tuesday, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun acknowledged that the images of civilian deaths in Bucha were \"deeply disturbing,\" but when it came to attributing blame for the situation he urged \"all sides\" to \"exercise restraint and avoid unfounded accusations.\"\"The relevant circumstances and specific causes of the incident should be verified and established. Any accusations should be based on facts,\" Zhang said.Similar comments were made at a regular briefing on Wednesday by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin, who said \"humanitarian issues should not be politicized.\"\"All parties should exercise restraint and avoid groundless accusations\" before fact-finding was concluded, Wang said, adding that China \"is willing to continue to work together with the international community to avoid any harm coming to civilians.\"But at home, China has been broadcasting a more pointed message, one that ties into a longer history of Russian and Chinese state media reinforcing each other's narratives -- on issues such as the treatment of Russian dissidents, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, and the origins of Covid-19 -- as they seek to refute the characterizations of Western officials and media. In an example of such overlap on Tuesday, state agency China News Service ran a post on the popular Twitter-like social media platform Weibo with the hashtag, \"Russia shows the video to prove that the Bucha incident is staged\" referencing a report from a Russian state news agency.  But as China amplifies Russian rhetoric in its reporting at home, some public shows of skepticism can be seen, even in China's highly moderated social media platforms.In a recent example, a widely followed military blogger wrote on Sunday that Ukrainians were responsible for a \"massacre\" of civilians -- but multiple users in the comments below suggested the details of the post were wrong.",

        "content": " lies may be catching up with it faster than it ever imagined.The war in  is defying President Vladimir Putin's expectations at every turn, not only with Russia's failure to capture Kyiv as planned but with the war crimes his soldiers are alleged to have committed in Bucha, a city close the capital, exposed for the world to see.Throughout history, wars have been won by forces turning new technologies to their advantage. The 1415 victory of English King Henry V over the French at the Battle of Agincourt came courtesy of his archers and their newly developed longbows, raining arrows over a range the French could not match.The war in Ukraine may see another historic first, with technology cutting through the fog of war, exposing the aggressors' lies and accelerating efforts to bring about their defeat.Satellite images of murdered civilians that match videos, recorded weeks later, of bodies at the roadside are providing compelling evidence of Russian war crimes, convincing Western leaders to ramp up sanctions on Russia and accelerate weapons supplies for Ukraine.How this will affect the final outcome of the war is unclear. But what is evident at a time when Ukraine is urgently seeking any additional leverage as Russian forces regroup for a new offensive, is that Russia's actions in Bucha are strengthening Ukraine's hand.While battlefield satellite imagery has been available to governments for decades and was instrumental in pinpointing war crimes during the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s -- notably locating a mass grave of many of the 7,000 Bosnian Muslims slaughtered in the town of Srebrenica in 1995 -- it has never been so immediately available in the public domain as now.Putin and his battlefield commanders appear not to care or not to have grasped the fact that orders and actions now leave an indelible record beyond their control that could come back to haunt them.They will be aware that in many past conflicts -- even as recent as the Syrian civil war -- leaders like Bashar al Assad escaped conviction and have even been rehabilitated, despite vast troves of incriminating documents spirited from government offices and police stations.But this is not the only lesson to which Putin should pay attention. Following the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian civil war, the war crimes tribunal in the Hague used political and military leaders' own words to help convict them.When the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic on trial, it had video of him looking over Sarajevo, condemning the civilians below to artillery and mortar fire.His military partner in war crimes there, General Ratko Mladic, also saw his words come back to help convict him, as video showed him on the outskirts of Srebrenica directing the filtering of civilians, many of whom would shortly be slaughtered by his soldiers, following his orders.That type of link may be harder to pin on Putin, but his 20-page thesis published last summer on why Ukraine is not a country, and his TV comments on why Russia should invade, will, if previous war crime courts are a precedent, count against him as author and director of the war.If Putin were to come to trial, his unravelling may turn out to have begun with his inability to understand his army's weaknesses and Ukraine's strengths. Failure to fulfil his first major objective, the capture of Kyiv, forced his troops to retreat, leaving their tide of terror exposed.They did what they have done so many times before, in Syria, in Chechnya, in Georgia:  committed awful abuses. And Putin and his officials did what they have done so many time before: lied to cover their crimes.Russian defense officials claimed photos and videos that emerged on April 2, showing murdered civilians -- shot in the head, some with their hands and legs bound -- were fake, saying their troops left before the killings occurred. \"The troops left the city on March 30,\" the defense ministry said in a statement. \"Where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake.\"They were very clear about the date. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, one of Putin's most seasoned spin masters, doubled down on the clumsy cover-up, insisting \"Russian forces left the Bucha town area as early as the 30th of March.\"But publicly available satellite images from space-tech company Maxar, taken March 18 while Russian troops were in control, showed the civilians lying dead at the road side in exactly the same locations as Ukrainian forces discovered them when they re-entered the town in early April. And drone video shot before March 10 showed a cyclist being shot and killed by Russian troops. Ukrainian forces found his body weeks later, exactly where he fell. In the months prior to Russia's invasion and the days since Maxar's images appeared, tracking Russian forces and their destruction, the public's understanding of the battlefield has been revolutionized. Coupled with the near-ubiquitous use of smartphone cameras, geolocation technology and sophisticated drones, Putin faces the possible reckoning he escaped in previous conflicts.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants more cameras, and wider access, to let the public see for themselves: \"This is what we are interested in, maximum access for journalists, maximum cooperation with international institutions, enrolment of the International Criminal Court, complete truth and full accountability,\" he said in a video address on Monday.Ukraine's enigmatic leader has realized it's not just high-tech, tank-busting weapons like Javelins and NLAWs, or surface-to-air missiles like Stingers and Starstreaks, that could turn the tide in the war. It's truth, and the tools -- satellites, drones and smartphones -- to deliver it.Unparalleled in any modern war, technology could hand the underdog this surprising advantage, undermining the lies of an oversized aggressor.  Zelensky was at pains for the United Nations to understand this when he spoke to them Tuesday: \"It is 2022 now. We have conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. And we can conduct full and transparent investigations.\"Like Henry V in 1415, Zelensky knows an advantage when he sees it. While satellite imagery may not be as game-changing as a six-foot yew branch and a length of hemp string, if he can use it cleverly, he may force Putin to talks much sooner than the Russian President would like.

        "content": ".China is grappling to get a surge in Covid-19 cases under control, after the BA.2 variant caused the country's worst infection rates since the virus was first discovered in Wuhan more than two years ago.The cause of the rapid rise is the Omicron variant -- and its more contagious sub-variant, BA.2, which has already become dominant in the US, Europe and many parts of the world.But  to almost everywhere else; the nation is sticking with its \"zero Covid\" policy, even as most others adjust to living with the reality of Covid-19.On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party announced the deployment of thousands of military personnel to the locked-down city of Shanghai to assist in the mandatory screening of all 25 million inhabitants. China's health authorities have repeatedly warned about the potential for health care systems to be overwhelmed if the virus spreads widely in the population of 1.4 billion -- especially given the low vaccination rate among the elderly -- as they put in place their radical attempts to stamp down infections.Meanwhile, in the US and Europe, leaders are finding ways to work around Covid-19 as it moves towards becoming endemic. Lawmakers in the Senate agreed on a bipartisan $10 billion Covid aid bill this week that allows the Biden administration to purchase more vaccines, maintain testing capacity and continue ongoing research.That move comes as companies and several states strip back their last remaining rules; a mask requirement on planes and in airports is set to expire this month, and those leading the country's response sound increasingly reluctant to impose strict new rules in the near future.\"Lockdown for lockdown's sake doesn't make any sense,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN last week.In England, the few remaining Covid-19 measures ended last week, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraging Brits to be \"careful and considerate\" if they test positive but no longer asking them to isolate.So, which approach is most appropriate? It's not a simple answer, according to experts.\"Public health is very much a local thing,\" Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, told CNN, with immunity rates dramatically different between countries.That also means that the spike of cases in China won't necessarily be replicated elsewhere. \"I expect to see some resurgence (in the US), but it's a very different picture, even with the increase in the Omicron subvariant BA.2,\" added Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina's Gillings School of Global Public Health.Lessler said that, given the rate of immunity in the population, a \"mild blip\" is more likely in the US than the dramatic spike seen in China. Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a second Covid-19 booster for some individuals -- adults over 50, and certain people 12 and older who are immunocompromised.Getting a fourth dose of the vaccine isn't \"something that everyone needs to be getting right now,\" said CNN medical analyst and emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen.\"We know that vaccination, plus that first booster, still protect you very well including against severe disease,\" she said. But \"some people may want to have an additional level of protection; if you're over 65, if you have chronic medical conditions and you're over 50, you may want to get that fourth dose.\" Wen stressed that \"everybody who is eligible\" should get the first booster shot, noting that many had not yet done so. Then, four months or more after that dose, when you become eligible for another, you may consider whether you'd benefit from the additional booster.It takes just a tiny virus-laden droplet -- about the width of a human blood cell -- to infect someone with Covid-19.This is what was shown in a study that deliberately infected healthy volunteers with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The findings of this research were published March 31 in the journal Nature Medicine.Challenge studies are controversial because they involve intentionally giving someone a virus or other pathogen in order to study its effects on the human body. Even with safeguards in place, there's an element of risk, particularly when studying a new virus, But they are also hugely valuable for understanding the course of an infection.\"Really, there's no other type of study where you can do that, because normally, patients only come to your attention if they have developed symptoms, and so you miss all of those preceding days when the infection is brewing,\" said lead study author Dr. Christopher Chiu, an infectious disease physician and immunologist at Imperial College London.Pandemic hospitalization rates are at new lows in the US, with all 50 states having lifted mask requirements as of March 25. But is there a cost to lifting restrictions and trying to return to a pre-pandemic normal?In a new study, researchers predict that the lifting of masking and social distancing restrictions in March 2022 could lead to resurgences of Covid-19 deaths in most states, based on projections from a simulation model.Published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Health Forum, the study also found that delaying lifting restrictions would not prevent surges in deaths for those states, concluding that there is no \"magic moment\" to lift restrictions,The researchers simulated lifting restrictions at different times in the year and predicted the number of deaths that would follow using current estimates for infection and vaccination rates, while accounting for differences in risk between age groups. \"There is likely no amount of additional waiting time in any state after which removing [Covid-19 restrictions] will not lead to a rise in morbidity and mortality,\" the study says.Where Omicron came from is still a mystery: How did a variant that looked so different from all its older cousins appear so suddenly? How to explain its jumble of mutations, many of which had rarely been seen in variants of interest?  reports how the virus we sneeze or cough out may be ever so slightly different from the one we were infected with. This is because viruses mutate -- especially when their genetic code is made of RNA, a close cousin of our DNA.In a briefing in March, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of World Health Organization's health emergencies program, said: \"As the virus reproduces itself, there are errors in reproducing its code.\" Viruses change all the time, often in ways that hurt their chances at survival. But once in a while, those mutations can work out in the virus' favor.The rule requiring masks on planes, in airports and on other means of public transportation is set to expire in the US this month.Experts are split over whether that's a good idea. Linsey Marr, an expert in transmission of infectious disease via aerosols, told CNN last week that dropping the mask mandate is reasonable with the caveat that it makes sense \"as long as cases remain low.\"But you may decide to keep covering up when you're traveling -- and the time you spend in the air is worth factoring in.\"I think I shall certainly continue using a mask for my own protection, especially if I'm going long haul,\" said Dr. Richard Dawood, a London-based travel health specialist.Why do we have such strong emotional connections to music? Well, the answer lies in our brains. On this episode, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to Professor Assal Habibi, a pianist and neuroscientist, about the brain science of music. ",

Instead, he was fuming about supposed infringements of protocol on calling meetings.This bizarre mini-circus at the beginning of a  on Tuesday only served to prove Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's subsequent point: What is the point of the UN if it can't act against crimes against humanity and punish the perpetrators?The Ukraine crisis is far from the first time that the UN's impotence -- baked into its institutions by the veto-wielding power of its five permanent Security Council members and its need to often seek consensus on the most controversial issues -- has failed to act to prevent atrocities.But the onslaught in Ukraine is really exposing the limits of this post-World War II institution. Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, can effectively veto investigations into its own alleged crimes.Zelensky proposed a conference to discuss reform of the United Nations and the Security Council -- an oft-mooted idea that never goes anywhere. He argued that there was no point in a Security Council if it couldn't promote security for UN member states. He also called for a Nuremberg-style trial to bring  to justice.\"Please show how we can reform or change and work for peace,\" Zelensky told Security Council members in his latest powerful video address. \"If there is no alternative and no option, then the next option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. And I know you can admit that if there is nothing that you can do besides conversation.\"Some US lawmakers have called for Russia to be expelled from the Security Council. Yet even if the UN General Assembly were to cast a required two-thirds vote to do so, Moscow could use its veto to block its own removal. And even if it didn't, China would likely back Moscow up.Critics of the United States and the West often complain they also manipulate the Security Council for their own ends. In 2003, for example, the Bush administration attempted, but failed, to obtain a second council resolution authorizing military action in Iraq, fueling the claims of opponents that the subsequent war was illegal.In the past, the Security Council has created international tribunals and investigations into war crimes in places like Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But there's no chance Moscow would vote to put itself on trial, meaning that if Russian President Vladimir Putin and his generals face justice, it won't come through the UN.The applause that rang through the Security Council chamber for Zelensky's speech must have sounded rather hollow from Kyiv.",
