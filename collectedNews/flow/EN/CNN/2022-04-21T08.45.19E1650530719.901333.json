        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen clashed Wednesday night in a TV debate that laid bare their differences, as they prepare to face off in the presidential runoff Sunday.The centrist incumbent beat a familiar tune of heavy investment in French industry and an uncompromising commitment to the European Union.Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally party, cast herself as the voice of a public struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.Le Pen, who lost to Macron in the 2017 runoff, said she was \"obliged to be the spokesperson of the people\" and promised to be \"the president of sovereignty.\"\"My absolute priority of the next five years is to give French people back their money,\" she said, repeating her campaign pledge to lower the VAT (value-added tax) on energy and fuel.The candidates' relations with  sparked a fiery exchange during the almost three-hour debate broadcast on TF1 and France 2, with Macron highlighting a loan to a Russian bank that Le Pen's party is still repaying.\"You're not speaking to other leaders, you're speaking to your banker when you're talking to Russia. That's the problem Mrs. Le Pen,\" he said.Le Pen has long been a vocal admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, now considered a pariah in the West due to his unprovoked assault on Ukraine. Le Pen visited the Russian strongman during her 2017 presidential campaign, but this time around, she was forced to scrap a promotional leaflet with a photo of her and Putin taken during that trip.Le Pen's previous aversion to NATO -- she once vowed to pull France from the alliance -- could also be a liability as recent polls show most people surveyed support France's involvement.On , Le Pen roundly supported her opponent's material support for the country as well as sanctions against Russia -- except for a ban on Russian oil and gas imports.\"I don't think it's the right method, that's not what in reality will hurt Russia. And above all that will do enormous hurt to the French people,\" she said.  Macron added that Russia was pursuing a \"suicidal\" course of action in Ukraine, though he has declined to label Moscow's actions in the country as \"genocide,\" Volodymyr Zelensky to come and see the evidence for himself.Throughout the debate, Le Pen portrayed Macron as a leader out of touch with voters, claiming he was ignorant of the suffering of health care workers before , as he promised more investment in health care.Elsewhere, Le Pen labeled Macron a \"climate hypocrite\" for following climate policies, such as encouraging consumers to buy electric cars, that she said were financially out of reach for many French people.\"We must have an (energy) transition but that must be, with time, much slower than what we are imposing on French people to allow them to deal with it,\" Le Pen said.Macron's stubborn defense of France's commitment to the European Union was also a hot topic in the debate.The President argued that the European Union works in France's favor, particularly when faced with markets like those of the US and China, whose populations far outstrip its own.\"It's there that Europe is useful for us. When Google comes and attacks us in our market, who comes and helps us? Europe. And when these big groups don't pay their taxes in our countries, what allows us to fight back? Europe.\"Le Pen, who in the 2017 election called for a French exit from the EU, has softened her stance, promising reform of the bloc and an \"alliance of nations.\"Le Pen also returned to one of her centerpiece policies: banning the wearing of hijabs in public.\"I think that the headscarf is a uniform imposed by the Islamists,\" she said. \"I think that the great majority of the women who wear one can't do otherwise in reality, even if they don't dare say so.\"Macron accused her of creating a \"system of equivalence\" among Islamism, terrorism and foreigners that would \"create civil war.\"The contest between Macron and Le Pen is expected to be a close one.Candidates are not allowed to campaign the day before the vote, or on election day itself, and the media will be subject to strict reporting restrictions from the day before the election until polls close at 8 p.m. Sunday in France.",

        "content": "In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and . It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.\"Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  \"btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?\"His mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.\"I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,\" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.\"But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,\" she says. \"I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.\"Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. \"What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,\" she says. \"I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help.\" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to , the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. \"It was so long, I got bullied for it,\" he says. \"Some people called me a girl.\"Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. \"Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,\" says his father, Joe Simons. \"He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.\"At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a \"pandemic suit\" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.\"His bear is very well taken care of,\" his mother says.Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. \"She really turned him on to being a public servant,\" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. \"My best goal is to be a president,\" he says. \"That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people.\" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit.",

        "content": "Turquoise LeJeune Parker ends every class by telling each of her students she loves them.The 34-year-old library teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Durham, North Carolina, does everything she can to prove it, and her recent fundraiser, which collected $106,000 to feed her students in need, is her most recent gesture of love.Winter break can mean weeks of food insecurity for children and their families, Durham Public Schools spokeswoman Crystal Roberts told CNN.\"It's a basic human right. We're not talking about raising money to buy people a vacation; this is food, a very, very basic thing,\" Parker said. \"We need to make sure we take care of our schools, because when we take care of our schools, we're taking care of our community.\"Her endeavor, which she named Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraiser, used the money she raised to purchase, pack and distribute more than 5,200 bags full of food to students at 12 schools throughout the Durham Public Schools district.In the dozen schools the project helps, 98% of the students rely on the low-cost or free lunches provided by their school. For many children, it is their main source for food. But once the holidays come around, the schools close and so do their cafeterias.\"Mrs. Parker has always had an army of donors and volunteers at the ready, to champion the needs of her students,\" Lakewood Elementary School Principal James Hopkins told CNN in a statement. \"What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.\"Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. \"I wanted to be a teacher all my life,\" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. \"This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.\"Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.\"I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,\" Parker said. \"'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.\"Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.\"She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,\" Parker said through tears. \"My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.\"On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.\"It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,\" Parker said. \"It took off in a way we could have never expected.\"Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.\"This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,\" Parker said. \"It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.\"With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.\"Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,\" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. \"Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,\" the statement continued. \"Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.\"The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks.",

        "content": ", who brings beauty and hope to the men and women living on Los Angeles' Skid Row, is the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year. As she received her award Sunday, Raines thanked her children including her late son, who inspired her work.\"This surely hasn't been easy. I stand before you a very broken woman,\" an emotional Raines said. \"I am a mother without a son and there are a lot of people in the streets without a mother -- and I feel like it's a fair exchange.\"Raines was presented with the CNN Hero of the Year award Sunday night by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa. Online voters selected her from among . Raines and her non-profit have been a mainstay on Skid Row for the past six years, providing food, clothing, and hair and makeup services to thousands of people.Every week, Raines and her team of volunteers set up shop and transform part of Skid Row -- home to one of the nation's largest concentrations of homeless people -- into an outdoor beauty salon.Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal or a hug.\"It's not so much just giving them makeup or doing their hair, it's also the physical touch,\" Raines said. \"People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.\"As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award.Raines struggled for years with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her young son, Demetrius.  \"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.\"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.\"Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.As Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.  \"We just had to use our best judgment and figure out some ways to still keep them fed, while keeping them safe, and while keeping us safe,\" Raines said. Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.\"My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying. But I've certainly gotten better. I can say his name now. He is the reason I do what I do.\"If you know someone who is making the world a better place, you can nominate them as a 2022 CNN Hero at . If you would like to support Raines' work or any of the non-profit organizations of the Top 10 CNN Heroes, you can also make a donation via .

In addition to water loss due to an , the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018.That's enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times.The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the , according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold. As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.It's bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are  -- if not worsen -- in the coming months.Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate.

Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.\"It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,\" Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. \"The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.\"",

Together with the neighboring city of Kunshan — which locked down earlier this month — it plays With no sign that the Chinese government is prepared to ease restrictions soon, concern is mounting about the economic damage they are causing, and the shock waves an extended lockdown will send around the world.Shanghai is the epicenter of the current Covid outbreak, but it's not alone — analysts at Nomura estimate that full or partial lockdowns are in place in 45 Chinese cities, affecting a quarter of the population and about 40% of the economy. Premier Li Keqiang warned on Monday for a third time in a week of the threat the upsurge in Covid posed to the Chinese economy. Here's three reasons why the rest of the world should be watching Shanghai closely, too. It has the largest GDP of all Chinese cities — 4.32 trillion yuan ($679 billion), the third largest stock market globally by value of the companies that trade there, and the fifth greatest number of  in the world.Shanghai is also the most attractive destination for international business eying a presence in mainland China.By the end of 2021, more than 800 multinational corporations had established regional or country headquarters in Shanghai, according to city authorities. Among them, 121 are Fortune Global 500 companies, including  ,  ,  ,    and  .More than 70,000 foreign-owned companies have offices in the city, more than 24,000 of which are Japanese companies, according to data from the .With a total market capitalization of $7.3 trillion, the Shanghai Stock Exchange — established in 1990 — trails only New York and London. Trading continues despite the lockdown, but some banks and investment firms have been asking staff to sleep by their desks to keep the market functioning.The pool of companies listed in Shanghai is heavily focused on large, state-owned enterprises that play a central role in the Chinese economy. They include the world's most valuable liquor maker , banking and insurance giants like ICBC and  , and state oil company  .The Shanghai exchange is also home to China's answer to Nasdaq -— Shanghai accounts for 3.8% of China's GDP.

The number made up 16.7% of China's total container shipmentslast year.Shanghai is also a major aviation hub in Asia. The city's airports  — Pudong International Airport and Hongqiao Airport — handled 122 million passengers in 2019, making the city the fourth busiest hub in the world after London, New York, and Tokyo.But the Covid outbreak has made port delays worse and forced the suspension of many passenger flights, sending  and putting even more pressure on global supply chains. Shanghai port remains operational, but industry data released in late March  that the number of vessels waiting to load or discharge had skyrocketed to a record high. State media also  that many truck drivers were struggling to get containers in and out of the port on time because of travel restrictions.The Greater Shanghai Area,which includes Kunshan and several other eastern cities, is a major manufacturing hub for industries from cars to semiconductors.  and General Motors both run factories in Shanghai in partnership with state-owned automaker SAIC Motor. Shanghai is also home to   first gigafactory in Asia.

In addition, Taiwan's Unimicron Technology, which supplies printed circuit boards to Apple, and Eson Precision — an affiliate of iPhone supplier Foxconn that also supplies components to Telsa —  halted production at their Kunshan facilities earlier this month.\"With Shanghai's significant trade links to East Asia, this could have spillover impacts on regional supply chains,\" Citi analysts also said in a research note late last week.\"We think Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and, to a lesser extent, Japan (on vehicles) look relatively exposed [to the disruptions],\" they said.Other industries include pharmaceuticals.
