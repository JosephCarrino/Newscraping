        "content": "Turquoise LeJeune Parker ends every class by telling each of her students she loves them.The 34-year-old library teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Durham, North Carolina, does everything she can to prove it, and her recent fundraiser, which collected $106,000 to feed her students in need, is her most recent gesture of love.Winter break can mean weeks of food insecurity for children and their families, Durham Public Schools spokeswoman Crystal Roberts told CNN.\"It's a basic human right. We're not talking about raising money to buy people a vacation; this is food, a very, very basic thing,\" Parker said. \"We need to make sure we take care of our schools, because when we take care of our schools, we're taking care of our community.\"Her endeavor, which she named Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraiser, used the money she raised to purchase, pack and distribute more than 5,200 bags full of food to students at 12 schools throughout the Durham Public Schools district.In the dozen schools the project helps, 98% of the students rely on the low-cost or free lunches provided by their school. For many children, it is their main source for food. But once the holidays come around, the schools close and so do their cafeterias.\"Mrs. Parker has always had an army of donors and volunteers at the ready, to champion the needs of her students,\" Lakewood Elementary School Principal James Hopkins told CNN in a statement. \"What's so impressive is that these efforts have provided students across Durham the same fortune; in this case, of receiving a substantial portion of food over the extended holiday break.\"Parker knew she wanted to be a teacher since she was 4 years old, sitting on her mother's bedroom floor, setting up her teddy bears and pretending they were her students. \"I wanted to be a teacher all my life,\" said Parker, who has been a teacher for 11 years. \"This is what I love, it's all I ever wanted to do, I am living my dream.\"Now the mother of one teaches more than 400 students, from kindergarten to fifth grade, and her love for them goes beyond the classroom.\"I call my students Mrs. Parker's professors. If that tells you anything, it's that I believe in them and I love them so very much,\" Parker said. \"'I need them to know that I love them, to remind them that love is an action word. I will tell them all day, but I will also show them all day.\"Her promise to keep all her student's fed began in 2015, when one of her student's parents confided in her they would not have enough food for the children to eat through the holiday break.\"She told me, 'I'll be okay, I can go without eating, but I can't let my kids go without eating for two weeks.' It's really hard to know they have stuff like this going on and not to do everything I can,\" Parker said through tears. \"My husband and I started thinking, if one family is asking this question, then there must be more.\"On December 14, 2015, Parker sent a text to everyone she knew, asking if anyone would be interested in donating money, so she could provide bags full of food to last them for the whole holiday break.Progress was slow but steady. The first year, she raised $500. Last year, she reached $55,000. But this year proved to be a record, with more than $106,000 donated from people all over the country.\"It has left me speechless. I've cried about it a little every day,\" Parker said. \"It took off in a way we could have never expected.\"Within two weeks, Mrs. Parker's Professors Foodraisers raised the money needed to purchase enough food to fill up big, brown grocery bags for thousands of children in the district.Each bag contained kid-friendly food, such as cereal, canned goods, granola bars and macaroni and cheese that can be cooked regardless of a family's living situation.\"This is a community effort. This is not $106,000 out of my pocket, this is the result of us operating as a collective,\" Parker said. \"It's because of all the people who gave their time, their money, their talents to make sure our kids are taken care of.\"With the help of more than 60 volunteers who accompanied Parker to a local Costco, the group purchased the food and spent days packing the bags before delivering them to each school by December 11.\"Mrs. Parker is a school district's dream teacher, a perfect mix of competence and compassion who is committed to serving young people holistically,\" Durham Public Schools said in a statement. \"Her Foodraiser addresses food insecurity head-on, particularly during a time of year when commercialism brings need to the forefront,\" the statement continued. \"Through her efforts, our food-insecure students have access to sustenance when schools are closed for the holidays. She is their lifeline.\"The fundraiser's success has inspired Parker to make it a lifelong project, she said, with an aim to feed as many children as possible during both winter and spring breaks.",

        "content": "The Taiwanese government is investigating a local TV news station after it aired alarming false reports of a Chinese invasion against the self-ruled island.During a Wednesday morning newscast on the government-affiliated Chinese Television System (CTS), part of the public Taiwan Broadcasting System, the network ran several fictional news tickers about China firing missiles toward the capital Taipei.\"New Taipei City has been hit by missiles from the communist military; Taipei port has exploded, facilities and ships have been damaged,\" one of the news tickers read. \"It is suspected that enemy agents have arsonized and planted explosives at Banqiao train station.\"Another ticker said, \"The Chinese communists have stepped up their preparations for a war, and (Taiwan's) President has issued an emergency order.\" The erroneous reports come as Taipei expresses concerns over China's potential military . Communist-ruled China says Taiwan -- a democratic island of 23 million people -- is an inalienable part of its territory, despite never having ruled it. Communist authorities in Beijing have refused to rule out the use of force to gain control of Taiwan and have been pressuring the island militarily, flying warplanes into its air defense identification zone, and staging naval drills around it. Last week, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) held joint combat readiness drills around Taiwan as a group of six bipartisan United States lawmakers met Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei.US support for Taiwan, especially through weapons sales, has angered Beijing.Taiwan maintains it is determined to defend itself from all forms of aggression. Last week, Taiwan's Defense Ministry issued a civil defense handbook detailing how residents should react in the event of a military conflict.On Wednesday, after the false reports flashed on screen, CTS issued a public apology and said the messages were created for use during fire service drills and were not meant to air to the public.The network had also run news tickers falsely claiming that there had been panic buying across Taiwan due to the military conflict and that a magnitude 7 earthquake had taken place in New Taipei City.In a public apology issued later on Wednesday, CTS said, \"Besides urgently clarifying and apologizing to our audience through our anchors, CTS has also broadcast our apology on our different channels. We have also punished relevant personnel, supervisors and managers for dereliction of duty.\" The erroneous report was widely shared on social media platforms, with some calling for the TV station to be investigated.Taiwan's National Communications Commission said in a statement that CTS is suspected of breaking laws on disturbing public order. It said it is launching an investigation into the incident.The commission said it has received 10 complaints from viewers, adding the network could be fined up to 2 million NTD (US $68,530) for its violations.Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said in Parliament on Wednesday that he had been \"surprised\" by the incident and urged the public to verify information before making comments.\"This is a good lesson for our friends in the media industry,\" he said.",

        "content": "In their letters to Santa Claus, most kids ask for toys, dolls or maybe a new Xbox. All Jonah Simons said he wanted was a coronavirus cure to save the world. That was last year. Jonah's letter was collected through the US Postal Service's Operation Santa program and . It was one of many that revealed the pandemic's toll on children around the country. This holiday season, the 10-year-old Florida boy is back with a different request for Santa.\"Dear Santa, it's me Jonah. Do you remember me? I was the one who asked for a covid cure,\" he wrote in a letter addressed to the North Pole and shared with CNN.  \"btw, ty so much for the vaccine! You helped save lives. This year, can I please have a Santa costume to spread your joy around the world?\"His mother, Doe Simons, says Jonah composes his Santa letters himself, without help from his parents.With a relentless virus and threats of the Omicron variant still plaguing a weary nation, Jonah has big plans for the Santa suit.\"I want to wear it and go around the neighborhood and spread Santa's joy, ask people what they want for Christmas,\" the fifth-grader told CNN. Jonah's mother says she's not positive whether her son still believes in Santa Claus.\"But Jonah has experienced Santa-like moments. For example, last year he sent his Xmas wish out into the universe and it came true to a certain extent,\" she says. \"I think writing that letter, even if he didn't believe in Santa, for him was the ability to exert some control over the problem (of the pandemic). It was his way to communicate his feelings and express what he wished would happen.\"Jonah has been spreading joy in his community of Parkland for years. Growing up in Parkland, where a 2018 massacre left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has had an effect on Jonah and other local children, his mother says. \"What happened here had a lot of impact on children here. He was in middle school, and his school was on lockdown that day,\" she says. \"I think that like Jonah, you're getting kids here who are civic minded and want to make a difference ... When he sees the impact his help has on others, he wants to do more to help.\" Jonah turned 10 in July, and in lieu of gifts he asked his family and friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His birthday effort raised $1,000 in donations from family and friends all over --  even his favorite employees at the local Publix store, his mother says. He also marked his birthday by donating his hair to , the charity that makes wigs for kids with cancer or other medical conditions.  During a year of lockdown, he teamed up with some friends and grew out his hair to nine inches. \"It was so long, I got bullied for it,\" he says. \"Some people called me a girl.\"Jonah's good deeds are not limited to birthdays. He works to help his community all year, including donating and sorting food for the homeless with the organization Feeding South Florida, and packing holiday gifts for children.Doe Simons says her son's charity begins close to home with his grandparents, who are in their 90s and live nearby. Jonah takes out their garbage every week, holds car doors open for them and helps them with their walkers up the elevator, she says.Jonah has long found ways to spread happiness. At age 3 he started dressing up as a doctor to visit loved ones who were ill. \"Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted a doctors' outfit,\" says his father, Joe Simons. \"He would dress as a doctor because his medicine was love. He would visit family members at the hospital, check their vitals, talk to the nurses and prescribe a special medicine for them: love.\"At the start of the pandemic, Jonah asked his parents to buy him a \"pandemic suit\" with the personal protective equipment that health care workers wear at the hospital. He told them he wanted one in case he needed to visit relatives at the hospital and prescribe his love medicine. Jonah hasn't needed to do that yet, so he mostly wears the outfit at home when he's treating his stuffed bear.\"His bear is very well taken care of,\" his mother says.Jonah's inspiration is Heather Khalil, a Parkland woman and has been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Charitable Service. \"She really turned him on to being a public servant,\" Doe Simons says. Jonah wants to be a lot of things when he grows up. Most days he tells people he wants to be a doctor, a lawyer or a police officer. But he thinks he can make a bigger difference as the leader of the free world. \"My best goal is to be a president,\" he says. \"That way, I can make changes to a lot of things and make decisions that help other people.\" Until then, he'll continue helping people in his community.Jonah already has big plans for his 11th birthday next July. He's hoping that Covid-19 will be a thing of the past by then, so he can go to sleepaway camp without a mask. He's also signed up to be an ambassador for the homeless. And once again he plans to use his birthday to raise money for charity. Maybe he'll even wear his Santa suit.",

        "content": ", who brings beauty and hope to the men and women living on Los Angeles' Skid Row, is the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year. As she received her award Sunday, Raines thanked her children including her late son, who inspired her work.\"This surely hasn't been easy. I stand before you a very broken woman,\" an emotional Raines said. \"I am a mother without a son and there are a lot of people in the streets without a mother -- and I feel like it's a fair exchange.\"Raines was presented with the CNN Hero of the Year award Sunday night by hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa. Online voters selected her from among . Raines and her non-profit have been a mainstay on Skid Row for the past six years, providing food, clothing, and hair and makeup services to thousands of people.Every week, Raines and her team of volunteers set up shop and transform part of Skid Row -- home to one of the nation's largest concentrations of homeless people -- into an outdoor beauty salon.Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal or a hug.\"It's not so much just giving them makeup or doing their hair, it's also the physical touch,\" Raines said. \"People need physical touch. That's what was hard when the pandemic hit. We had to stop doing hair, we had to stop doing barber services. And that might be the nicest touch they've had all day.\"As the 2021 CNN Hero of the Year, Raines will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award.Raines struggled for years with financial insecurity, grief and loss after the death of her young son, Demetrius.  \"The world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by,\" she said. \"You never know what anyone's going through, you know?\"Raines' twin sister urged her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.\"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,\" she said. \"I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.\"Initially, Beauty 2 the Streetz was small, with just Raines and her children helping to hand out food, drinks, hygiene kits and beauty products. Raines alone would color people's hair and do their makeup.But then she started livestreaming the events and posting pictures to Instagram, and Beauty 2 the Streetz soon became more well known.Licensed hair stylists, barbers, makeup artists and even big makeup companies reached out to Raines saying they wanted to help.By 2019, Raines had registered Beauty 2 the Streetz as an official non-profit with about two dozen volunteers generously offering their time and efforts to help Skid Row's residents feel beautiful.As Raines' efforts evolved into a full-scale operation, with music playing and lines forming around the block, she began providing more supplies and essentials: rape whistles, tents, sleeping bags, hygiene items -- and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to Downtown Los Angeles to feed and bring supplies to people.Then, as Covid-19 affected many organizations' efforts, services dried up. But Raines pivoted, opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule -- and she kept going.In tandem with the health department, which provided masks, sanitizer and other personal protection items, Raines said her group and other L.A. County non-profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen.  \"We just had to use our best judgment and figure out some ways to still keep them fed, while keeping them safe, and while keeping us safe,\" Raines said. Today, as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning, Raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often-overlooked population know there is hope.\"My sun didn't come out for 30 years. It was 30 years' worth of tomorrows before I even saw the break of day. I would be lying if I said I was always completely happy from doing this. It didn't take away the pain of my son dying. But I've certainly gotten better. I can say his name now. He is the reason I do what I do.\"If you know someone who is making the world a better place, you can nominate them as a 2022 CNN Hero at . If you would like to support Raines' work or any of the non-profit organizations of the Top 10 CNN Heroes, you can also make a donation via .

        "content": "As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on  and , many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store's parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, . (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers' cars cool on hot, sunny days.) As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.\"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\" Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America's campaign for , told CNN. \"Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there's no better place than the roofs of America's big-box superstores.\" Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted  on .Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.   CNN reached out to  — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company  having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company  it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's . It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company's stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. \"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\" Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the , said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it's doable, Callaway told CNN. The New York City resident led  that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a  to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.  \"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. \"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\"CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.",

Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times. The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\"This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,\" Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. \"(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.\"It's the first major global air quality report based on WHO's new , which were . The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including ,  and other respiratory illnesses.Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around  were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the  analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw  in pollution, the report showed.\"The (United States') reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,\" the authors wrote.Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country's most vulnerable and marginalized communities. \"We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,\" said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. \"We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we're still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we're seeing in major cities.\"Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which  in July.   China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a  of polluting industries in the city.The report also found that the , which had acted as the world's major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year.  and  have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change. \"This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.\" Hammes said. The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. \"When you don't have that data, you're really in the dark,\" Hammes said.Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country's air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh. Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\"I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,\" Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. \"However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.\"The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health. Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\"We've got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,\" she said. \"There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we're on (would be) irreversible.\"",

As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation.It's bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are  -- if not worsen -- in the coming months.Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin.

As a traditional pastoral community, livestock is vital to the Barabaig, but around Ruaha National Park, lions threaten their animals, their livelihoods, and sometimes even their lives.Historically, the tribe would track and kill lions that posed a threat to their community -- but with populations of the big cat dwindling, a group of conservationists are now helping Barabaig warriors to protect the lions they once hunted.Lions are classified as vulnerable, with a population of . Amy Dickman, director of the University of Oxford's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, says that lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historic range and their numbers have nearly halved in the last 20 years.Tanzania is home to an estimated  of the lion population in sub-Saharan Africa, but conflict is rife between lions and the people who live alongside them. Last year, three children looking for lost cattle were  near the Ngorongoro conservation area in Northern Tanzania.\"These kinds of instances are sadly not that uncommon,\" says Dickman. \"Particularly in Southern Tanzania there's a very real risk of living alongside these animals. They pose a genuine threat to people and to their safety.\"According to Dickman there are around 800 lions in the wider Ruaha landscape, though it's hard to give accurate numbers. All the tribal communities who call the region home struggle to maintain balance with the lions they live alongside.For their better-known neighbors, the Maasai, killing a lion is . For the Barabaig it isn't so closely linked with personal and cultural identity, but can provide status and wealth.\"If there's been an attack on cattle, the Barabaig will go and start a lion hunt, but it's not just about retaliation,\" explains Dickman. She says that the warrior who throws the first spear to strike the lion gets to take a paw as proof of the kill. \"Girls will pay them lots of attention and they will get gifts of cattle\" -- an important economic and cultural asset in the Barabaig community says Dickman.She is also joint CEO of conservation organization Lion Landscapes, which works in Ruaha, and also in Kenya and Zambia, to protect the big cat. An important element of its work is the recruitment of \"Lion Defenders.\" These are community members with honed tracking skills and good knowledge of the area.\"The Lion Defenders program has been built around the idea of what it really means to be a warrior,\" says Dickman. \"To be a warrior is to protect your community, to be someone they can rely on, to be someone with high status.\"There are 18 Lion Defenders currently in the program, usually young men between 18 and 20 years old. Stephano Asecheka, who is from the Barabaig tribe, acts as an intermediary between these young men and the community. \"Their task is to survey the border areas early in the morning for traces and tracks of lions so as to inform herders of the safest grazing areas,\" explains Asecheka.\"The challenges Lion Defenders face is with some people in the community who are not in support of the project,\" he says. \"(They) refuse to give correct information of the lion hunters and even threaten them (the Lion Defenders) to be disowned by the community for destroying the tradition.\"According to Asecheka, taking tribespeople on tours into Ruaha National Park endears the community to the lions and helps them understand the value of the animals as a tourist draw that can boost the local economy. \"They feel a sense of ownership and get to understand the right reasons to why we are protecting the lions,\" he explains.He is hopeful that lion populations will increase, and that communities will adapt by building stronger houses and livestock enclosures. Lion Landscapes helps to build fortified enclosures.Asecheka says fewer lions are being killed, thanks to the project. \"We still have men who hunt lions outside the reserve,\" he continues. \"But such cases are also falling with the awareness being created by the project.\"The key to Lion Landscapes' conservation work is changing the Barabaig perception of lions, says Dickman. \"Our work is centered around trying to empower local communities so that they see a benefit from conservation,\" she explains.Among the group's innovations is a  that trains local people to set up camera traps. Villages are awarded points for each image they capture of a wild animal, with more points given for rarer animals and those with a higher risk of human-wildlife conflict.Groups of four villages compete to score the most points each quarter, with the winner receiving around $2,000 worth of healthcare, veterinary medicine, and education aid, and the other villages receiving smaller amounts. Lion Landscapes says the initiative generates valuable wildlife data, trains local people in conservation techniques, and by providing benefits from wildlife being on their land, has led to some villages banning lion hunting.Instead of associating the big cats with loss of cattle, wealth, and life, Dickman says the Barabaig now connect the animals with access to good healthcare, education, and subsidized school meals.Through its combined programs, Dickman says that lion killings have decreased by over 70% in the core area where Lion Landscapes works. \"The communities that we work with have truly come on board as partners,\" she says.",
