        "content": "Joe Biden promised to do \"whatever is needed\" to protect the banking system.. But investors fear other lenders may still be hit by the fallout, sparking sharp falls in share prices globally.. Earlier on Monday, Spain's Santander and Germany's Commerzbank saw their share prices dive by more than 10% at one point. . A string of smaller US banks suffered even worse losses than European counterparts on Monday, despite reassuring customers that they had more than enough liquidity to protect themselves from shocks. . The volatility has led to speculation that America's Federal Reserve will now pause its plans to keep raising interest rates, designed to tame inflation.. Mr Biden said that people and businesses that had deposited money with Silicon Valley Bank would be able to access all their cash from Monday, after the government stepped in to protect their deposits in full. . Many business customers had faced the prospect of not being able to pay staff and suppliers after their funds were frozen.. BBC North America Technology correspondent James Clayton spoke to people queuing up all day outside the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California, to access their funds.. As the bank was no longer offering wire transfers, they were taking out their money in cashier cheques. . Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. It had been trying to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis. . Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank in New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run.. Mr Biden promised that covering the deposits would not cost taxpayers anything, and instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks.. As part of efforts to restore confidence, US regulators also unveiled a new way for banks to borrow emergency funds in a crisis. . Yet there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another US lender, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms. . Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the stockbrokers AJ Bell, said: \"The first rush of relief has been replaced by niggling concerns that the era of high rates might be more difficult for some banks to stomach than had been previously thought. . \"In the US, bank stocks slid despite Joe Biden's pledge that 'whatever is needed' will be carried out to prevent more dominos from tumbling.\" . The failure of SVB has re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks.. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says there will be a thorough and transparent review of the collapse.. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared.. \"They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,\" he said.. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue \"problematic\".. \"Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,\" he said.. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008.. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered \"too big to fail\". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.  . Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates. . The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates.. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change. . And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen.. ",

        "content": "In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 2.6% lower, with shares falling even after HSBC agreed to buy SVB's UK arm.. US markets were flat, recovering after initially being dragged lower by banks.. Stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan suffered sharp losses.. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said markets had fallen because of \"a fear of what else might lie out there\".. \"The imminent crisis may have been averted but it's alerted people to the fact that there's a group of companies out there with business models who will struggle in a high interest rate environment - as that's what's undone SVB,\" Mr Godber said.. But he added that the direct impact on UK economy and UK market was limited, \"because the UK financial sector is really healthy and well capitalised\".. Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. SVB was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. The US has now agreed a rescue deal for customers of SVB, with all depositors fully protected. The US government has also taken over Signature Bank, saying it will guarantee all deposits as part of emergency measures to shore up the banking system.. Wall Street's stock exchanges fell during early trading on Monday over fears of contagion following SVB's collapse, although subsequently recovered ground.. There were huge falls in the value of some US banking stocks, . .. The value of shares in one bank, Western Alliance, tumbled by about 75% on opening, while another, First Republic, was down 65%. Trading of more than a dozen regional bank stocks, including First Republic, has now been halted.. On Monday, HSBC announced it was buying SVB's UK arm for £1. The deal followed a frantic weekend of talks as the government and Bank of England sought a solution, and the news bought relief to UK tech firms who feared going bust without support.. The Bank of England said no other UK banks had been \"materially affected\" by SVB's collapse. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also said there was \"never a systemic risk\" to the UK's financial stability.. Elsewhere, France's economy minister said US bank failures did not create a risk of contagion, and Germany's finance watchdog said SVB's collapse did not pose a threat to financial stability.. But investors nevertheless took fright on Monday, with the US dollar and oil prices also slipping.. Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said the markets remained \"edgy\" despite the best efforts of governments and regulators to contain the situation.. \"There's plenty to worry about whether it be the conflict in Ukraine, inflation, rising interest rates and now a potential banking crisis has been added to the mix,\" he said.. \"Little surprise people are feeling a bit spooked.\". Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, and for good reason, as their performance can affect your life and finances.. Even if you don't invest money directly yourself, there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments.. So big rises or falls in share prices can affect your pension, although pension savings are usually a long-term bet.. Anyone who has a pension pot invested and is taking an income from it will again see their investment go up and down with the stock markets.. That could mean getting less than you expected if you cash in too much after stock markets have fallen, making it important to plan how to make up any of this shortfall, experts say.. So \"the markets\" matter - maybe not as much as everyday wages, but for the future.. ",

        "content": "But the $8bn (£6.6bn) proposal faced a torrent of online activism in recent weeks, particularly among youth activists on TikTok.. Opponents argued it should be halted over its climate and wildlife impacts.. Located on Alaska's remote North Slope, it is the largest oil development in the region for decades and could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.. According to US Bureau of Land Management estimates, that means it will generate up to 278 million metric tonnes of CO2e over its 30-year lifetime - the equivalent of adding two million cars to US roads every year.. CO2e is a unit used to express the climate impact of all greenhouse gases together, as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide.. Monday's approval comes one day after the Biden administration imposed limits on oil and gas drilling in 16 million acres of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean, a compromise of sorts with anti-Willow activists.. Environmentalists had argued Willow is inconsistent with President Biden's pledges to lead on climate action.. More than one million letters of protest were written to the White House, and a Change.org petition calling for Willow to be halted drew more than three million signatures.. \"It's the wrong move and will be a disaster for wildlife, lands, communities, and our climate,\" environmental charity Sierra Club said on Monday.. Sonny Ahk, a young Iñuipat activist from Alaska who campaigned against Willow, said the development would \"lock in Arctic oil and gas extraction for another 30 years and catalyse future oil expansion in the Arctic\".. \"While out-of-state executives take in record profits, local residents are left to contend with the detrimental impacts of being surrounded by massive drilling operations,\" he said. . But all three lawmakers who represent Alaska in Congress, including one Democrat, pushed for the project's approval, touting it as a much-needed investment in the region's communities.. They also argued it would help boost domestic energy production and lessen the country's reliance on foreign oil.. \"This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,\" added ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance on Monday.. The US energy giant, which is already Alaska's largest crude oil producer, will enhance energy security, create good union jobs and provide benefits to Alaska Native communities, he said.. So why has a president who has embraced strong action on climate change just approved a project dubbed a \"carbon bomb\"?. It's because Willow is all about politics and the law - and not the environment. . While running as a candidate back in 2020, Joe Biden promised that there would be \"no more drilling on federal lands, period\". That promise was broken last year when the administration announced plans to sell drilling leases, under pressure from the courts. . The White House will likely say that the role of the courts has also influenced the Willow decision.. Oil company ConocoPhillips have held the lease since 1999 and would have had a strong case to appeal if their plans had been turned down. . The Biden administration is obviously aware that, from a purely climate perspective, the project can't really be justified. So, as a sop to opponents, they've tried to balance the approval with new bans on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean. . Most environmentalists aren't buying that trade off.. Willow is also deeply political.. With a presidential election in 18 months, Mr Biden is keen to be seen as a centrist, concerned about gas supply and prices for US citizens.. But, in giving the green light to drilling, he now risks the support of many young people who voted for him in large numbers in 2020. . This video can not be played.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. A draft law introduced in the Russian parliament on Monday aims to push back the age bracket for compulsory military service, from the current 18-27 years to 21-30. . Reuters reported that, due to the transition period between the old legislation and the new, 2024 and 2025 would see the conscription age span 10 or 11 years rather than the usual nine - meaning more men would be eligible to fight. . Russia's previous attempt to draft thousands of new recruits into the Ukraine war met with some resistance. In September the announcement of a partial military mobilisation saw .  as men of draft age sought to flee the call-up. . The Kremlin said reports of fighting-age men fleeing had been exaggerated.. Besides the Bakhmut fighting, seven residents were injured elsewhere in Donetsk region on Monday, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line. He added that Russia was bringing more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. ",
