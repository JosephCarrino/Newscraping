        "content": "Watch: Armed police storm a building in Hamburg. Police say the gunman acted alone and is thought to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among the six or seven fatalities reported by German media.. As yet, \"there is no reliable information on the motive\", police say.. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelböge street in the city's Gross Borstel district.. Police say they found a dead person at the scene who they believe may have been a perpetrator and investigations are continuing.. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. . Officers who went in found people who \"may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally\", he said.. \"The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled.\". He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued.. \"All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals,\" Mr Vehren said.. The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, at around 21:00 (20:00 GMT) telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".. Residents nearby were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.. Hamburg's Interior Minister, Andy Grote, said on Twitter that police special forces and a large number of officers had been deployed to the scene.. Police have appealed to the public not to share assumptions or to spread rumours.. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement.. The denomination was founded in the USA towards the end of the 19th Century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. The headquarters of the movement is in New York.. ",

        "content": "In the Chinese system of governance, the functions of the president are largely ceremonial.. Mr Xi's power comes from him being General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.. Confirmation of his third term as president had been widely expected. The naming of a new premier and various ministers in the coming days is considered more important.. The new appointees are all expected to be Xi Jinping loyalists. This includes Li Qiang, who is tipped to serve as Mr Xi's number two.. Mr Xi has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests.. The so-called Two Sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China's direction in the coming years.. Prior to Mr Xi, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office. When he had this restriction changed in 2018, it transformed him into a figure with a reach not seen since Chairman Mao.. ",

        "content": "He was charged with her murder and acquitted, but later found liable for her death in civil court. . Blake died \"peacefully with family and friends\", his family said. . A statement released by his niece, Noreen Austin, on Thursday said he had died from heart disease.. As a child, the New Jersey native got his start by appearing in the Our Gang comedy series after his family moved to California.. With a career beginning in the late 1930s, he acted in classic film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and as the murderer Perry Smith in a 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood. . He also had a role on the NBC series Hell Town and was nominated for an Emmy for CBS made-for-TV movie Judgement Day: The John List Story. . Once considered among the greatest actors of his generation, his career never recovered after his arrest. . Mr Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was alone in the actor's car in the Studio City neighbourhood of Los Angeles when she was shot. . The actor told police he had left her alone to return to the Italian restaurant where they had just dined to retrieve a gun he had left behind, and found her dead.. Four years after her death, including a year of Mr Blake awaiting trial in jail, a jury in LA found him not guilty of her murder.. Many comparisons were made at the time to the trial of celebrity OJ Simpson, who had been acquitted for murdering his ex-wife in Los Angeles 10 years earlier.. He was later ordered by a judge in a civil case to pay $30m (£25m) to the children of his ex-wife - leading him to declare bankruptcy. . He unsuccessfully appealed, but managed to get the penalty sum halved to $15m.. Mr Blake always maintained his innocence.. He had four children during his life and was married to actress Sondra Kerr for 22 years before their 1983 divorce. . In 2017 he married longtime friend Pamela Hudak, but they divorced two years later.. ",

        "content": "Shares in banks have fallen around the world - with the four largest US banks, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, losing more than $50bn in market value.. One venture capitalist told the BBC the day's events were \"wild\" and \"brutal\".. In Friday morning trade, shares in Asian banks were also lower.. Shares in SVB saw their biggest one-day drop on record as they plunged by more than 60% and lost another 20% in after-hours trade..  after losing around $1.8bn when it offloaded a portfolio of assets, mainly US Treasuries.. But more concerningly for the bank, some start-ups who have money deposited have been advised to withdraw funds.. Hannah Chelkowski, founder of Blank Ventures, a fund that invests in financial technology, told the BBC the situation was \"wild\". She is advising companies in her portfolio to withdraw funds. . \"It's crazy how it's just unravelled like this... The interesting thing is that it's the most start-up friendly bank and supported start-ups so much through Covid. Now VCs are telling their portfolio companies to pull their funds,\" she said.. \"It's brutal,\" she added.. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses, SVB is the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. SVB did not immediately respond to a BBC request for further comment.. In the wider market, there were concerns about the value of bonds held by banks as rising interest rates made those bonds less valuable.. Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply increased interest rates as they try to curb inflation.. Banks tend to hold large portfolios of bonds and as a result are sitting on significant potential losses. The falls in the value of bonds held by banks is not necessarily a problem unless they are forced to sell them.. But, if like Silicon Valley Bank, lenders have to sell the bonds they hold at a loss it could have a major impact on their profits.. \"The banks are casualties of the hike in interest rates,\" Ray Wang, founder and chief executive of Silicon Valley-based consultancy Constellation Research told the BBC.\"Nobody at Silicon Valley Bank and in a lot of places thought that these interest rate hikes would have lasted this long. And I think that's really what happened. They bet wrong,\" he said.. ",
