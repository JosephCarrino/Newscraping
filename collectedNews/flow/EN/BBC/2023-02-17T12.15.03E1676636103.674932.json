        "content": "Watch: Ohio man walks through new life after train derailment. It was that day that a toxin-laden train derailed just metres from their successful garbage truck business, which they had grown from five customers to more than 7,000 over an 18-year period in and around this close-knit Ohio town. . \"It's totally wrecked our life,\" he told the BBC, choking back tears in the parking lot of his business, where the stench of chemicals and sulphur from the derailment remains powerful. . \"I'm at the point now where I want out of here,\" he added. \"We're going to relocate. We can't do it no more.\" . After the derailment, emergency crews performed a controlled release of vinyl chloride from five railcars that were at risk of exploding.. Mr Hamner's eyes are red and swollen, which he credits to the lingering physical impact of the chemicals spilled in East Palestine.. But he and his wife tell the BBC that their main wounds are unseen and psychological. . \"I'm losing so much sleep. I've already been to the doctor twice, and I'm taking anxiety pills,\" he said. . \"This is 10 times worst than just losing my livelihood. We built this business.\" . Like her husband, Mrs Hamner said she's spent sleepless nights worrying about their business, their 10 employees and the town where she's spent 20 years of her life. . Already, several dozen of their long-standing customers have cancelled their collection services and said they plan to leave East Palestine. . \"I'm afraid for the people that live here,\" she says. \"I don't know anybody who can sleep, because it's on so many fronts. It's your business, it's your health, and it's the health of your friends.\". Standing on a mound of dirt within sight of the charred remains of several railway cars from the derailment, Mr Hamner likened the incident to Chernobyl, an April 1986 nuclear accident in then-Soviet Ukraine. . He's not alone. Over the course of two days in East Palestine, several residents told the BBC that they consider the derailment a seminal moment in the town's history. At least for the foreseeable future, their lives will be measured by what happened before the 3 February disaster and what took place after. . Federal and local officials have advised residents to drink bottled water. The authorities said it was safe for people to return to the town a couple days after the derailment, though environmental experts have voiced scepticism.. Sufficient exposure to the chemicals released in the crash - which include vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate  - can result in symptoms from nausea to cancer.. \"For this town, this is a Pearl Harbor, or a 9/11. One of those things that people always talk about,\" said coffee shop owner Ben Ratner. . In Mr Ratner's case, he said the stress and trauma has manifested itself in an \"interesting mix\" of emotions and sensations. . He now visibly bristles at the once-routine sound of trains passing by, adding that they seem louder and more abrasive than they had in the past. . He described friends in East Palestine as easily panicked now and constantly on alert, feelings that he compared to post-traumatic stress. . \"We need to start looking at the emotional and psychological long-term impact,\" he said. . \"People are concerned when they hear trains, or when they think of their kids going outside, or letting their dog outside and having it accidentally drink contaminated waterâ€¦ it's serious.\". Mr Ratner added that local children - after years of Covid-19 disruptions - now have to contend with another traumatic event upending their lives.. \"This thing could go on for generations,\" he said. \"It's a lot more than gasses and the big cloud and plume of chemicals.\". The chemicals released in the crash and the fire can have serious impacts on health, a professor of environmental health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Keeve Nachman, told the BBC.. \"What's really missing is information about how people come into contact with these chemicals in the air, drinking water or through soil.\". On Thursday, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Michael Regan, visited East Palestine to oversee recovery efforts, meet local officials and reassure residents that the government stands behind them. . \"We see you, we hear you, and we understand why there is anxiety,\" he said.. The agency says it has not detected harmful levels of contaminants in the air and has been testing air quality inside hundreds of homes.. Additionally, both of Ohio's Senators - JD Vance and Sherrod Brown - offered messages of support for the community, while Ohio Governor Mike DeWine requested assistance from federal authorities.. Water officials have acknowledged the waterways of the Ohio River are contaminated but they say drinking water supplies are not affected.. In a letter, Alan Shaw, the CEO of Norfolk Southern - the company that operated the derailed train - acknowledged that residents are tired, worried and left with \"questions without answers\". . But the train company's decision not to attend a question-and-answer session with residents on Wednesday, saying it was concerned about safety, has increased local anger at its response.. This video can not be played. Watch: Anger erupts at Ohio train crash town meeting. Some residents believe there is little that can be said to overcome the mistrust and anger that still hovers over the town. . Several reported that they had yet to hear from inspectors or officials nearly a fortnight after the derailment. . \"Nobody has been down to ask us anything. Nobody has checked anything. Nothing,\" said Kim Hancock, who lives just over one mile (1.6 km) from the derailment site. . \"How can they tell me that all is safe? There's no way,\" she said. . \"I'm not dumb. I watched the smoke cloud come over my house.\". ",

They expressed their \"deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love\".. The family went on to say frontotemporal dementia is the most common form of dementia in people under 60.. \"Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,\" . Willis became a household name in the 1980s and 90s after starring in blockbuster films such as Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, Armageddon and Pulp Fiction. . He has also been nominated for five Golden Globes - winning one for Moonlighting - and also three Emmys, where he won two.. But his family said last year that .  as his aphasia was affecting his cognitive abilities.. The new statement on Thursday said they hoped media attention would raise awareness of the actor's condition. . It said: \"Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately.. \"We know in our hearts that - if he could today - he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.\". The statement was signed by members of Willis's family including his wife Emma Heming - with whom he has two daughters - and his former wife Demi Moore and their three daughters.. Dementia comes in many forms with different causes.. The word dementia describes the impact of a diseased brain on our memory, language and thinking skill.. Common causes include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.. Bruce Willis' diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia is relative rare. . It is also unusual as it largely affects people in midlife, whereas most other forms are found in old age. . Fronto-temporal dementia is caused by a build-up of toxic proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (those behind the forehead and ears) which are thought to kill brain cells.. Damage to these regions affects language (such a Mr Willis' aphasia) as well as behaviour and the ability to plan. . There is still no cure or even a way of slowing the disease down as symptoms continue to get worse.. On average people live 8-10 years after diagnosis fronto-temporal dementia, but some people live much longer. . US journalist Maria Shriver, a prominent campaigner for brain disorder patient care and research, tweeted: \"My heart goes out to Bruce Willis and his family, & also my gratitude for shining a much needed light on this disease. . \"When people step forward it helps all of us. When people get a diagnosis it's extremely difficult, but also for most a relief to get a diagnosis.\". Aaron Paul, who starred in America's Breaking Bad TV crime drama, said Willis was \"such a damn legend\", adding: \"Love you so much my friend!\". US singer and actress Queen Latifah wrote in a post on Instagram: \"God bless you my brother we love you!!! all the best. Thank you and your family for all the entertainment!!!\". Actress Selma Blair, who has multiple sclerosis, simply wrote: \"Sending love.\". According to the . , frontotemporal dementia is an \"uncommon\" form of the disease that causes the sufferer problems with behaviour and language.. Symptoms also include slow or stiff movements, loss of bladder or bowel control - although this tends to be later on - and muscle weakness.. ",

On Friday, Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that officials would further investigate the crashed balloon but would not \"jump to conclusions\".. This is the first time remnants of such a balloon have been discovered in Taiwan's offshore islands, said senior defence official Chen Yu-lin, according to local media..  in recent weeks, after the US .  in its airspace earlier this month. The US also shot down three other objects it says are unlikely to be foreign spy crafts.. The sphere found on Dongyin was about a metre in diameter and bore the name of a China-based company that, based on online searches, stocks meteorological and radio appliances.. The company Taiyuan Radio No 1 Factory Co. Ltd is based in Taiyuan, one of China's main industrial bases and capital of Shanxi province.. The sphere was also marked \"GTS13 digital atmospheric sounding instrument\" and \"meteorological instrument\", with simplified Chinese language characters, the military said in a statement.. China has used simplified Chinese characters since the 1950s, but Taiwan continues to use traditional characters.. Authorities have not released pictures of the object.. Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday that it had not detected any Chinese surveillance balloons, but it had spotted weather balloons previously. It also said it would not hesitate to shoot down any balloon it deemed a threat.. These comments came after the Financial Times reported earlier this week - citing unnamed officials - that dozens of Chinese military balloons had been spotted in Taiwan's airspace in recent years.. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. . But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.. ",
