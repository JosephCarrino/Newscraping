        "content": "Watch: Survivors rescued after seven days under rubble. Miray had been trapped in the ruins for 178 hours - seven-and-a-half days.. Video showed workers cheering and shouting \"God is great\" as she was lifted out of the darkness. . Several others were saved on Monday, including a 13-year-old boy trapped for 182 hours. But rescues are becoming rarer as the death toll passes 35,000.. This is partly due to limits on how long the human body can survive without water.. Other factors include how much space the trapped person has to breathe and how bad their injuries are, an emergency medicine specialist told the BBC.. Prof Tony Redmond also said the cold temperatures in Turkey and Syria were a double-edged sword.. If you are very cold, your blood vessels shrink and you can last a little longer from your injuries, he explained. But getting too cold is harmful in itself.. The death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria is expected to rise dramatically, with the United Nations' humanitarian chief warning it could double. . Miray - the young girl rescued on Monday in the city of Adiyaman - was attached to a stretcher and carried away by rescue workers. Local media reported teams on the ground were hoping to find her older sister.. In hard-hit Hatay province, 13-year-old Kaan was rescued after being trapped for 182 hours - as well as a woman called Naide Umay, found alive after 175 hours.. In the city of Kahramanmaras, rescue workers had made contact with a grandmother, mother and baby - all stuck, but alive -Â and were working to reach them.. Thousands of teams across the region - including coal miners and experts using thermal cameras and sniffer dogs - have been scouring the remains of collapsed buildings to find remaining survivors.. But hopes of finding people alive are dwindling and there is a sense that the rescue mission will soon end.. The focus is shifting to recovery, with officials looking at shelter, food and healthcare.. Questions are also being raised about . .. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but during one visit to a disaster zone last week, he appeared to blame fate..

        "content": "President Sandu said the \"plot\" would involve \"protests by the so-called opposition\", aiming to \"overthrow the constitutional order\".. Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain.. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. . Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. . Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use \"saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages\".. The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.. She urged Moldova's parliament to adopt laws to give the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors \"the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats\". She added that \"the Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will fail\".. This video can not be played. Maia Sandu: \"We have the right to choose what we want for our country\" (2020 interview). Moldova's main Socialist and Communist opposition bloc has strong links with Moscow. President Sandu's predecessor Igor Dodon - who ruled from 2016 to 2020 - pursued close ties with Russia.. But since the USSR's collapse in 1991, Moldova has forged a deeper partnership with Romania, an EU member.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, former Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\"..
