        "content": "While suicides contributed to the toll, the data shows that homicides form the majority of gun-related deaths. . More than 390 million guns are owned by US civilians.. According to the research - which was published this week in the .  - the rise in gun-related deaths among Americans between the ages of one and 19 was part of an overall 33.4% increase in firearm homicides nationwide. . Homicides, the study noted, disproportionately impact young Americans. . Over the same time period, the rate of firearm suicides in the US rose by 1.1%. . The overall rate of gun deaths of all reasons - suicide, homicide, unintentional and undetermined - among children and teenagers rose by 29.5%, more than twice that of the wider population. . \"We continue to fail to protect our youth from a preventable cause of death,\" said a research letter published in the journal on Wednesday. . The rate of gun-related deaths per 100,000 residents rose among both men and women and across ethnic demographics between 2019 and 2020, with the largest increase among black Americans.  . In past years, gun-related deaths were second only to car crashes as the leading cause of death among young Americans. Car deaths, however, have fallen over time and in 2020 approximately 3,900 Americans under 19 died in vehicle crashes. . Incidents of drug overdoses and poisonings rose 83.6% between 2019 and 2020, and now are the third leading cause of death in that age group. A separate .  published earlier in April found that 954 young people died of overdoses in 2020, compared to 492 in 2019. . Gun violence in the US has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020. . \"The reasons for the increase are unclear,\" the research letter said. \"It cannot be assumed that firearm-related mortality will later revert to pre-pandemic levels\". . A separate study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults - just under 3% of the population - became first-time gun owners during the pandemic between January and April 2021. . This, in turn, exposed 11 million people to household firearms, including five million children. . This video can not be played.

It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned by the Kremlin, but they were widely cited in Russian state media including the Interfax and Tass news agencies.. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were \"looking into\" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. . Meanwhile, a senior EU official told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. . Moldova has summoned Moscow's ambassador over the comments, which its foreign ministry described as \"deeply concerning\".. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. . A small detachment of around 1,500 Russian troops has been stationed in the region since 1995 as part of a truce agreement. . Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region on Friday. . \"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,\" Gen Minnekayev said. . Mr Putin made similar claims, without providing evidence, about alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine before launching the invasion on 24 February. . Ukraine's defence ministry denounced Gen Minnekayev's comments as Russian \"imperialism\". . And the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to them in his regular overnight address. \"The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries,\" he claimed.. He earlier said Russia was planning on holding a series of sham independence referendums in occupied regions to create a series of pro-Russian breakaway states. . \"If they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know this is not to help you,\" he warned.. \"This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. This is the reality. Be careful.\". A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defence ministry said that referendums were planned in Kherson and occupied areas around Zaporizhzhia in the coming weeks. .
