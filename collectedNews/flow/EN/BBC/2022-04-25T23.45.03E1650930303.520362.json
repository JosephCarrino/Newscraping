        "content": "He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Mr Musk said . . . \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\" he added. . \"Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\". The move by Mr Musk comes as Twitter has struggled to stop the spread of misinformation on its platform. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year, it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\".. While the takeover has been cheered by his followers, Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform and would instead stay on his own social network, Truth Social.. Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself. . In 2018, he clashed with the US financial markets regulator over his use of the platform to share sensitive information about his car company Tesla, resulting in him being banned from doing so and paying a $40m settlement. . And in 2019 he sparked a row after calling a diver \"pedo guy\" on the platform. . Vernon Unsworth, who had been involved in rescuing 12 Thai schoolboys trapped in cave, sought $190m in damages but eventually lost his defamation case to Mr Musk.  . Mr Musk's decision to take over the company comes as it faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. . The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: \"The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.\". On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chair of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an \"extraordinary development in the world of social media\". . \"It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate.\". Mr Musk has said he doesn't \"care about the economics\" of the purchase, however he will face pressure to improve the platform's financial performance. . Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. . The company ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook.. However Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was \"the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders\".. Mr Musk has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. . As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.  . It is not clear who will lead the new company. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November.. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: \"I don't have confidence in management.\". Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted . Twitter responded by putting in place a so-called \"poison pill\" defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company.. But Twitter's stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. . How many miles do you need to drive before it pays off?.

        "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked the court to hold Mr Trump in contempt after he missed a March deadline to present certain documents. . Mr Trump's lawyer said she would appeal the ruling. . \"Everything that your honour and the attorney general said that we haven't done - we have done,\" attorney Alina Habba said in court. . After a \"very diligent\" search, there were simply no more relevant documents to provide, she said. . Ms James, a Democrat, opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump, a Republican, had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans.. The stakes have been raised in this year's long legal wrangle between Donald Trump and New York's dogged state attorney general. . Letitia James has accused the former president of stonewalling - and now she's successfully made it that much more costly for him not to comply with her requests. . $10,000 a day adds up quickly, and if that isn't enough to convince him to provide the requested materials, the judge could yet increase the fines further. . That's not out of the realm of possibility given the judge's remark that - while Donald Trump takes his business seriously - so does the judge. . Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing, and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In court on Monday, Ms Habba called the civil probe as a \"fishing expedition\". . Justice Engoron said a contempt finding was warranted because of what he called \"repeated failures\" to hand over the requested materials.. \"Mr Trump... I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt,\" he said, although the former president was not in the courtroom.. The attorney general's office called the ruling a \"major victory\" in the legal battle against Mr Trump. . \"Today, justice prevailed,\" said Ms James. \"For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company's financial dealings. Today's ruling makes clear: no one is above the law.\". The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices..

        "content": "The centrist president's victory over Marine Le Pen may have been convincing, but he has a problem. There are new elections around the corner to France's National Assembly and a big section of the electorate dislikes him.. \"There is a lot of hate,\" sociologist Michel Wieviorka told the BBC. \"He said last night 'I am happy' but I don't think he can be totally happy because there are plenty of clouds in his sky.\". Politically, if he fares badly in the June elections, he could end up losing his majority and may not be able to form his own government. That's why his opponents are calling the next vote a \"third round\".. Why would that matter if he's just won 58.5% of the national vote? . Many of his voters are not natural supporters and are unlikely to back him in June. A large number of far-left voters held their noses to keep the far right out of power, but then there are also a number of mainstream parties that threw their weight behind him too, including the Republicans, Greens and Socialists.. One opinion poll indicated that 63% of voters would rather he lost his majority and had to share power with an opposition government, known in France as \"co-habitation\".. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has designs on becoming prime minister himself. If that were to happen, there would be little love lost between him and the president. He claimed that Mr Macron had won the vote with the worst result in French history. Even if he was wrong, it was still a valid point that more than a third of voters had either stayed away from the election or voted for no candidate at all.. France's election winner is therefore a man in a hurry. He wants to rush through important reforms to persuade a jaded electorate to vote for his party. . Within days, he needs to form a new government, replacing Prime Minister Jean Castex, who led France through the Covid pandemic. . Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne is seen as a popular choice, because she has a strong record on social issues and it is social reforms that are his priority right now. . Mr Macron is also believed to want a woman in the job.. And she seems to understand the need for speed - especially when it comes to the issue which dominated both rounds of the presidential election: the cost of living that is causing a headache across French society and became the focus of Marine Le Pen's campaign.. \"We need to provide quick answers,\" she told reporters.. Indeed, within hours of the election result, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised to keep in place a price cap on gas and electricity price rises until the end of 2022. . But spending is just one of four priorities Macron needs to push in the coming weeks, according to Junior Economy Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher.  The environment, education, and health are also key, with green issues a particular priority for younger voters. . And don't forget, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds did not bother to vote on Sunday.. But the flagship reform Macron is really determined to push through is controversial: raising the pension age from 62 to 65.. However, government spokesman Gabriel Attal has promised the Macron administration is in listening mode. . He insisted there would be a change of approach over the next five years, and on pensions they would redouble consultation to \"hear people's anxieties\". . Asking the French people to work three more years before they collect their pensions is not exactly a popular move, so Mr Macron is at pains to say he is flexible on how it is brought in and when. And yet his finance minister did not rule out forcing it through without a vote if they had to.. For a president sometimes dubbed Jupiter for perceived arrogance, observers see this as a critical moment for him to adapt.. \"He must accept the idea that negotiation is important, it doesn't mean top-down decisions,\" says Michel Wieviorka. \"I think it's difficult for him psychologically and culturally to change to a more democratic way of politics.\". In his victory speech, Mr Macron declared he was no longer a candidate in one camp but the president for everybody. No-one would be left by the wayside, he vowed. . He also insisted that the next five years would be handled differently from the last, without explaining how. He may not have long to prove it..
