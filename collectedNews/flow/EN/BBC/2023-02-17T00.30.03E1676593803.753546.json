        "content": "Watch: Zelensky says peace deal would 'leave Ukraine weaker as a state'. In a BBC interview to mark a year since Russia's full-scale invasion, he warned conceding land would mean Russia could \"keep coming back\", while Western weapons would bring peace closer. . Mr Zelensky also said a predicted spring offensive had already begun.. \"Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,\" he said. . He does, however, believe Ukraine's forces can keep resisting Russia's advance until they are able to launch a counter-offensive - although he repeated his calls for more military aid from the West.. \"Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands,\" Mr Zelensky told the BBC.. He met UK and EU leaders last week in a bid to bolster international support and to ask for modern arms to defend his country. When Ukraine's president asked for modern fighter jets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing is off the table\".. But Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated with the speed with which Western weapons have arrived. Deliveries of battle tanks - . , including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. President Zelensky also addressed .  to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a single Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. . \"I hope [Belarus] won't join [the war],\" he said. \"If it does, we will fight and we will survive.\" Allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack again would be a \"huge mistake\", he added.. This video can not be played. Watch: Zelensky warns Belarus against helping Russian offensive. Russian forces launched part of their full-scale invasion from Belarus 12 months ago. They drove south towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv but were fought back and made to retreat within weeks, after suffering heavy casualties.. When asked if he was surprised by Russia's tactics in the war, Mr Zelensky described them as \"valueless\".. \"The way they destroyed everything. If their soldiers received [and carried out] those orders, that means they share those same values.\".  suggested Russian troops in Ukraine were dying in greater numbers this month than at any time since the first week of their invasion. The figures cannot be verified, but the UK's Ministry of Defence said the trends were \"likely accurate\".. \"Today, our survival is our unity,\" said Mr Zelensky on how he thought the war will end. \"I believe Ukraine is fighting for its survival.\" His country was moving towards Europe economically, as well as through its values, he said.. \"We chose this path. We want security guarantees. Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state.\". \"It's not about compromise itself,\" he said. \"Why would we be afraid of that? We have millions of compromises in life every day.. \"The question is with whom? With Putin? No. Because there's no trust. Dialogue with him? No. Because there's no trust.\". ",

        "content": "The US would now improve its detection of similar aerial objects, he said.. Mr Biden also said he would speak with China's President Xi Jinping soon about this month's incident.. \"I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,\" Mr Biden said at the White House on Thursday.. China has denied the balloon was used for surveillance, instead saying it blew off course while collecting weather data.. But Mr Biden reiterated the view of US officials that the balloon, which traversed the country at an altitude of about 40,000ft (12,000m) before being blown out of the sky by a US fighter jet over the Atlantic, was in fact used for spying.. He said the US was continuing to speak with China on the issue. \"We are not looking for a new cold war,\" Mr Biden said.. Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure to talk directly to the public about the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon, as well as the three unidentified objects American fighter jets have scrambled to destroy over the past week.. On Thursday afternoon he did that - but his brief appearance will do very little to silence critics or those asking for more information and explanations.. He shed no light on the nature of those objects and provided no further information about the first Chinese balloon. He didn't discuss when the Chinese balloon was first detected, its intended purpose or recent reports that it had been directed toward the US island of Guam but then changed course. Nor did he say why, after a flurry of incidents last week, no new objects have been targeted.. As an explanatory endeavour, it was weak sauce. And as a public-relations effort, it will probably come up short.. It may calm the waters for now, but the next time a balloon floats across the American sky, or fighters scramble and missiles fly, the questions will return with renewed urgency.. Speaking about three other objects subsequently shot down over Alaska, north-west Canada and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border, Mr Biden said the intelligence community believed they were \"most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions\".. Mr Biden's remarks raise the possibility the US used millions of dollars of military equipment against harmless, potentially handmade objects floated by enthusiasts.. Senior House Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut, who is briefed on national security matters, said earlier this week it should not be US policy to use fighter jets to tackle all high-altitude objects.. He told NPR that \"a military mission to shoot down a balloon is a very, very expensive thing\", adding \"we need to think a little bit harder about that\".. Mr Biden said enhanced radar introduced in response to the Chinese balloon might explain the discovery of the three objects.. \"That's why I've directed my team to come back to me with sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.\". This video can not be played. Watch: 'Whatâ€™s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. Mr Biden's comments came after the White House felt the need to dispel suggestions the three objects were of extra-terrestrial origin.. Officials said the slow-moving unidentified objects did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\" and were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\".. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which was co-ordinating searches for the objects in Canada, said on Thursday it would suspend the search of Lake Huron, in part due to the low probability of recovery.. On whether he would take similar action again, Mr Biden said: \"Make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people I will take it down.\". He declined to say when he planned to speak with China's President Xi when asked during an interview with NBC News.. \"I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with the United States and with me,\" Biden told the broadcaster.. China has repeated its explanation for the balloon shot down on 4 February, with a spokesman telling reporters the US should try to avoid \"misunderstandings and misjudgements\".. Amid the heightened tensions over North American skies, military officials said on Thursday that American warplanes had intercepted Russian jets flying near Alaska for a second time this week. . The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad), which is jointly run by the US and Canada, said in a statement that it was a \"routine\" contact with the Russians.. ",

Mr Lukashenko suggested that next week would be a good time to start, with US President Joe Biden due to visit Poland.. \"I invite [President Biden] to Belarus,\" Mr Lukashenko said. \"It's not far from Warsaw, Thirty minutes and he'll be in Minsk. He could land his plane here. I will persuade the president of Russia to come. I invite him too to Minsk, as well as Biden. We will sit down and reach an agreement.\" .

        "content": "The process to change gender on documents could in theory now take around three to four months.. Another law passed on Thursday includes paid menstrual leave for women suffering severe period pain.. Previously, people needed a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and to have been on hormonal treatment for two years to change their gender on their ID card. . Now, they can identify as another gender and confirm it three months later. Those aged 12 to 13 will need a judge's approval while people aged 14 and 15 will need parental permission. . Before the vote, equality minister Irene Montero told lawmakers that \"trans people are not sick people, they are just people\".. She was pictured smiling outside congress after the law was passed, bringing a 20-month-long parliamentary debate to a close. . But the law was not universally welcomed. One protester, Patricia Bilbao, said: \"We are here to support the rights of women as they are completely erasing us with these misogynist laws.\". In 2014, Denmark was the first European country to pass a similar law, and is one of nine countries in the continent that have adopted self-declaration systems.. Sweden, which in 1972 was the first to make gender transition legal at all, has recently restricted hormone treatment and mastectomies to those under 18.. In January, .  passed by the Scottish government, was blocked by Westminster who said it could have a \"serious adverse impact\" on existing laws in the UK. . On Thursday, Spain also became the first country in Europe to pass legislation giving women paid menstrual leave, something Ms Montero added was a legislature \"of feminist conquests.\". The law means the state will pay sick leave for women suffering severe period pain, if they have a doctor's note.. It has been met with resistance, with the UGT trade union concerned that employers will favour hiring men. . Also, abortion access was increased in public hospitals and minors can now undergo the procedure without parental permission at ages 16 and 17.. Menstrual and contraceptive products will also be freely distributed throughout high schools.  . ",
