        "content": "Mr Zelensky said Beijing's proposal appeared to show \"there is respect for our territorial integrity\".. Russia's foreign ministry said any settlement had to recognise its rule in four areas it says it has annexed.. Meanwhile, Western figures gave the proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing \"doesn't have much credibility\" because it had \"not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine\".. Russian leader Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine a year ago with the aim of seizing the capital Kyiv and deposing Mr Zelensky's government. But the attack on Kyiv was repulsed, the Ukrainian military was able to retake some areas, and the conflict has become a grinding war of attrition for territory in the the eastern Donbas region.. China's 12-point plan breaks little new ground, with Beijing refraining from criticising Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. . But speaking at a lengthy news conference to mark the first anniversary of the invasion, Mr Zelensky said China's plan was \"an important signal that they are preparing to take part\".. He said that he saw the Chinese paper as \"thoughts\" rather than a concrete plan, and said he wanted to believe Beijing would not provide arms to Russia. . Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said .  and ammunition to Russia - a claim strongly denied by Beijing.. Mr Zelensky also said he planned to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, but gave no details. . \"China started talking about Ukraine and that's not bad,\" he added.. A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said it appreciated China's proposal but that any agreement would have to accept \"new territorial realities\".. Last year, Moscow declared that it had annexed four areas of Ukraine - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - despite its troops not fully controlling any of the regions.. The Chinese proposals follow Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Moscow, where he met Mr Putin on Wednesday. . This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. In a long news conference marking a year since Russia's invasion, Mr Zelensky said victory \"will inevitably await us\" if allies \"respect their promises and deadlines\".. Poland said it had already delivered four Leopard tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - is sending 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.. The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after .  during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia's invasion. . \"We didn't work well for many years, we didn't pay attention, I think it's a big mistake,\" he said.. Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.. \"What I saw. It was horrible,\" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.. The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.. The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.. The White House's fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (Â£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. . A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.. Moldova is Europe's poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. It comes days after US President .  and held talks with Mr Zelensky.. ",

        "content": "Mr Igwe, an opposition PDP member of the House of Representatives, was also caught with a list of people to give the money to, police say.. In previous elections, politicians have been accused of rigging polls through vote buying.. Nigeria has recently issued new banknotes, partly in order to make it harder for politicians to amass large sums of money in order to bribe voters.. However, not enough of the new notes are in circulation, leading to widespread anger and frustration. People have been queuing for hours outside banks in order to get cash, often without success, while some have attacked banks.. Some 40% of Nigerians do not have bank accounts and so rely on cash to buy food, and for other everyday uses.. , police in Rivers State, where Mr Igwe was arrested, urged \"all contestants and political parties to comply strictly with provisions of the Electoral Act and other relevant laws\".. Mr Igwe, who represents part of the southern city of Port Harcout, has not yet commented on the matter.. The elections are predicted to be the most competitive since the end of military rule in 1999, with three candidates - Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Bola Tinubu of the governing APC - all seen as potential winners.. The head of the country's electoral commission, Inec, has told the BBC's Peter Okwoche that the authorities are prepared for Saturday's vote.. \"Reports around the country indicate that materials are being delivered to the local governments as planned,\" Mahmood Yakubu said.. \"We're exactly where we wanted to be in terms of preparation,\" Mr Yakubu added, saying security agencies had \"assured\" Inec that the vote would go ahead smoothly.. This video can not be played. \"We are ready,\" says Inec chairman Mahmood Yakubu. There had been concerns that it might not be possible to hold the election in parts of the country, which is facing an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, a nationwide kidnapping-for-ransom crisis and a separatist insurgency in the south-east.. A senatorial candidate for the opposition Labour Party, Oyibo Chukwu, was shot dead on Wednesday in the south-eastern Enugu State while he was returning from the campaign trail. The parliamentary election in Enugu East has been postponed following his killing.. Police have blamed the separatist group Ipob for the killings. The group has not yet commented. . The authorities have ordered the closure of all land borders for Saturday's vote starting from midnight for 24 hours, to stop foreign nationals from trying to vote.. On Thursday Inec revealed that a total of 87.2 million voter cards had been collected. More than 93 million people had registered to vote, which means that some six million people had not managed to collect their cards and so would not be able to cast their ballots.. There have been reports of people saying they were unable to collect their cards. There was one case of voter cards . , only to be discovered by a hunter.. ",

        "content": "To persuade the public, the news anchor portrayed President Putin as a sea captain steering the good ship Russia through stormy waters of global unrest.. \"Russia is an oasis of stability, a safe harbour,\" he continued. \"If it wasn't for Putin what would have become of us?\". So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. . Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia's neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. . Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. . All problems of Titanic proportions.. So why did Russia's president set a course for war and territorial conquest? . \"On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,\" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. . \"Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?\" . Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. . The Kremlin had expected its \"special military operation\" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia's orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine's capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.. Russia's leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin's way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.. Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?. This week he gave us some clues. . His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.. The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that \"there are battles going on right now on [Russia's] historical frontiers\" and praised Russia's \"courageous warriors\".  . Conclusion: don't expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. \"If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,\" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin's former economic adviser. \"There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.\". But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  . \"It's possible to sit down with anyone,\" Andrei Illarionov continues, \"but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. . \"Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.\". When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow's assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. . And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine's stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: \"Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own securityâ¦\"  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.. Putin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the \"collective West\", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia's enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.. But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia's economy even more. . As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia's Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. . Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. . \"Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,\" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there's a chance to redistribute wealth.\". \"The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.\". \"Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?\" I ask Konstantin.. \"Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.\". \"And does Putin know these discussions are happening?\". \"He knows. I think he knows everything.\". This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament declared: \"As long as there's Putin, there's Russia.\" . It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin's fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine. . ",
