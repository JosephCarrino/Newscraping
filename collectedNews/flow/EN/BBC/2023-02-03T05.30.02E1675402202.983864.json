        "content": "But military leaders decided against shooting it down as there were concerns over the danger of falling debris.. China has not yet commented.. US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the situation.. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, officials said.. A senior defence official speaking on condition of anonymity said the government prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, in case the White House ordered the object to be shot down.. Top military leaders, including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met on Wednesday to assess the threat. Mr Austin was travelling in the Philippines at the time.. But they advised against taking \"kinetic action\" against the balloon because of the danger falling debris might pose to people on the ground.. Montana, a sparsely populated state, is home to one of only three nuclear missile silo fields in the country, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, and officials said the apparent spy craft was flying over sensitive sites to collect information.. The defence official, however, said there was no \"significantly enhanced threat\" of US intelligence being compromised because American officials \"know exactly where this balloon is and exactly where it's passing over\".. He added that there was also no threat to civilian aviation as the balloon was \"significantly\" above the altitude used by commercial airlines. . The defence official said the US had raised the matter with Chinese officials in their embassy in Washington DC and in Beijing.. During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location. They also refused to provide more details of the object, including its size. . \"There have been reports of pilots seeing this thing even though it's pretty high up in the sky,\" the unnamed defence official said. \"So you know, it's sizable.\". They added that such surveillance balloons had been tracked in the past several years, but this one was \"appearing to hang out for a longer period of time this time around\".. It confused social media users in Montana, with some posting images of a pale round object high in the sky. Others reported seeing US military planes in the area, apparently monitoring the object.. Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the \"big white circle in the sky\" and went home to get a better camera. . \"I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,\" he said. \"So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.\". Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed China's alleged balloon.. \"The level of espionage aimed at our country by Beijing has grown dramatically more intense & brazen over the last 5 years,\" he tweeted.. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, a Republican, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"deeply troubling\" situation.. Speaking at an unrelated event in Washington DC on Thursday, CIA Director William Burns made no mention of the balloon, but called China the \"biggest geopolitical challenge\" currently facing the US.. The alleged spy craft is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary.. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.. He will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, the .

Writing on Twitter, the BCRA said the new note would \"commemorate the development of science and medicine in Argentina\".. It will feature pioneering doctors Cecilia Grierson and Ramón Carrillo, it added - although it is not clear when the note will enter circulation.. When Argentina's current currency was introduced in 1992, its value was pegged at one US dollar.. But that fixed exchange rate system was abandoned after the financial crisis that engulfed the country in 2001 and 2002.. Since then, the peso has lost so much of its value that one local artist uses banknotes for painting on, because they are cheaper than a canvas.. Sergio Diaz, of Salta, recently painted a picture depicting Steven Spielberg's movie Jaws as a parody of Argentina's ever-increasing inflation.. Argentina has seen prices rise sharply as the cost of commodities, including energy, has gone up.. Soaring prices have largely been attributed to a bout of central bank money-printing, as well as the war in Ukraine.. In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money for South America's second largest economy.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. Last summer, the troubled country had . .. In September, the central bank also raised its main rate of interest to 75% as it tried to rein in the soaring cost of living..

The country's leaders said they needed to find ways to finance commerce without relying on US dollars - although discussions are at an early stage.. ",

        "content": "Mr Bolsonaro narrowly lost October's vote, prompting unsubstantiated claims by his supporters of voting fraud. . His son has admitted the meeting took place but denies a crime was committed. . Mr do Val told a news conference on Thursday that he was invited to a meeting on 9 December with Mr Bolsonaro by Daniel Silveira, a former lawmaker and a close ally of the former president.  This was more than a month after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had won the election and three days before his presidency was formally approved. . Mr Silveira then allegedly asked Mr do Val to get the head of the electoral authority, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, to make compromising comments on tape that would lead to his arrest.. \"I immediately said that I would not do that, I would not do that type of thing,\" said Mr do Val, who claimed that Mr Bolsonaro \"sat in silence\" while Mr Silveira laid out the details of the plot during the meeting.. However, he has denied suggestions that he was coerced by the former president, telling journalists he \"was in a position similar to mine, listening to an odd idea by Daniel Silveira\".. Mr do Val's comments come after Mr Silveira was arrested on Thursday in relation to previous offences after his parliamentary immunity came to an end. . According to Reuters, Mr de Moraes has ordered Mr do Val to provide sworn testimony to federal police within five days as part of a Supreme Court investigation into the 8 January riots, in which . Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed the country's Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in the capital, Brasília, after camping in and around the city  for weeks calling for a military coup.. Mr Bolsonaro has voiced \"regret\" for the unrest, but denies he caused it. Neither he nor his representatives have yet commented on Mr do Val's remarks.. The former president is currently in Florida after leaving Brazil at the end of December, before his successor was sworn in. His lawyers have told the BBC he has . ",

        "content": "\"It's unbelievable but true,\" he said. \"We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.\". Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.. Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.. Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.. \"Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,\" the 70-year-old leader said. \"We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.\" . Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments but did tell reporters that \"as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond\". . Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of World War Two's Battle of Stalingrad, which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops in a major turning point of the war.. Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of the conflict. . Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the anniversary, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled. . Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33. . The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated five million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria. . Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he says are leading the Kyiv government. . And he returned to the theme throughout his speech. . \"Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,\" he said. . \"Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West.\". But he vowed that while it was \"unbelievable but true\" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it. . Berlin has agreed to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, prompting the Russian company Fores - a Urals-based energy industry firm - to offer five million roubles (£58,250) to the first Russian soldier to destroy or capture one. . Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle.. Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade. . As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion. . Local media reported that regional Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president. . Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take \"revenge\" against the West for aiding Ukraine. . \"Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,\" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv. . Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was \"increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions\" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy. . Later, addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in the US via videolink, Mr Zelensky thanked US President Joe Biden for his support and set Ukrainian forces a goal of defeating the Russian invasion in the next year. . \"We must do everything we can together so that next year - on the first Thursday of February - we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil,\" Mr Zelensky said. .
