        "content": "\"Some want to go to Canada, some want to go to warmer states, and we are there for them as they continue to move on with their pursuit of this dream,\" Mr Adams said.. The New York Post has reported that migrants in New York City are being given free bus tickets to Plattsburgh, New York state, about 20 miles (32km) south of the Canadian border. From there, they pay taxis and shuttles to take them to Quebec. . Quebec immigration minister Christine Fréchette told reporters in Montreal that the development was \"surprising\".. She said it highlighted the need to \"solve the problem of Roxham Road\", referring to an unofficial border crossing south of Montreal used by thousands of asylum seekers every year.. \"I think it makes the urgency of the situation even more apparent,\" Ms Fréchette said, adding that Canada and the US were negotiating to update the Safe Third Country Agreement.. The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada. . But it only applies at official border crossings, which Roxham Road is not. This loophole allows the migrants arriving from New York to have their asylum cases heard by Canadian immigration authorities.. New York City has an ongoing migrant crisis, as states on the southern US border bus newly arrived migrants to America's most populous city.. In a January visit to Texas, Mayor Adams told reporters there was \"no room in New York\" for the migrants. . Days before, he had released a statement saying his city had welcomed 40,000 asylum seekers since last spring, providing them with food, shelter and other resources. . \"We are at our breaking point,\" the statement read. \"Based off our projections, we anticipate being unable to continue sheltering arriving asylum seekers on our own and have submitted an emergency mutual aid request to the State of New York.\". Mr Adams confirmed to Fox 5 on Monday that the city was providing free bus tickets for migrants.. \"If they are seeking to go somewhere else, we are helping in the reticketing process,\" he said..

        "content": "Other energy firms have seen similar rises, with Shell reporting record earnings of nearly $40bn last week.. The profits have led to calls for energy firms to pay more tax as many households struggle with rising bills.. BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was \"helping provide the energy the world needs\" and investing the transition to green energy.. Energy prices had begun to climb following the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply in March last year after Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about supplies.. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back to about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs. . It has led to bumper profits for energy companies, but also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses. . Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.. The windfall tax only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. The rate was originally set at 25%, but has now been increased to 35%.. Oil and gas firms also pay 30% corporation tax on their profits as well as a supplementary 10% rate. Along with the new windfall tax, that takes their total tax rate to 75%. . However, companies are able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. . BP said its UK business, which accounts for less than 10% of its global profits, will pay $2.2bn in tax for 2022, including $700mn due to the Energy Profits Levy. . Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the windfall tax struck the \"right balance\" between helping families with the cost of living and securing the UK's energy supplies.. \"We've been very clear that we want to  encourage re-investment of the sector's profits back into the economy and that's why the energy profits levy works in precisely the way it does,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . But Labour's shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband called on the government increase the windfall tax. . \"It's yet another day of enormous profits at an energy giant, the windfalls of war, coming out of the pockets of the British people..

        "content": "A job offer to Mr Myers was later rescinded, and Mr Santos told news outlet Semafor he was concerned by wiretapping charges faced by the aide during previous work as a journalist.. The accusations are the latest in a series of controversies for Mr Santos. . The BBC has reached out to the congressman's office for comment.. On Twitter on Friday, Mr Myers said he had filed a complaint to the Capitol police and wrote a letter to the House ethics committee, which can investigate violations of House rules, related to incidents he claims took place during his brief time working in Mr Santos's office. . The letter, which he posted online, details his allegations against Mr Santos. He said he was offered a job late last month in the Long Island congressman's office as his staff assistant. . The 34-year-old has faced growing calls to resign after he admitted fabricating parts of his resume and biography since his election in New York last year.. He is also facing multiple investigations over his campaign spending and financial reports. He has previously denied wrongdoing.. According to Mr Myers, on 25 January, Mr Santos asked him if he had a profile on Grindr, a popular LGBT dating app. Mr Santos then allegedly informed him that he had a profile on Grindr, Mr Myers said.. On a separate occasion the same day, Mr Myers was alone with Mr Santos in the congressman's office sorting mail.. \"He called me 'buddy' and insisted I sit next to him on the sofa,\" Mr Myers wrote. \"I proceeded to move forward with a discussion about the mail, but the congressman stopped me by placing his hand on my left leg, near my knee.\" . Mr Myers claimed the congressman then invited him to karaoke, which he declined, and proceeded to \"take his hand and move it down my leg into my inner-thigh\", where he \"touched\" his groin.. Next, Mr Myers said Mr Santos told him that his husband was away for the night and invited him to come over.. \"I quickly pushed the congressman's hand away and grabbed the mail from the table and proceeded to discuss the topic of constituent correspondence,\" Mr Myers wrote. . Mr Myers was working under the status of \"volunteer\" at the time of the incident, he said, something he told was necessary as he waited for his new-hire paperwork to process through the payroll department. This was something he said he later learned was against House rules. . On Monday, 30 January, Mr Myers said he was called into Mr Santos' office and asked about his background as a journalist, matters that Mr Myers said had already been discussed prior to receiving a job offer. . Last year, he was charged with wiretapping while working as a journalist in Ohio after publishing audio of court testimony submitted by a courthouse source. . . . According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Mr Myers said he pleaded not guilty to the charges and the case was automatically dismissed under Ohio's criminal rules of procedure after no indictment was brought within 60 days. . Mr Myers said his job offer in Mr Santos's office was rescinded on 1 February.  . Last week, Mr Santos told Semafor he expected a progressive news website to publish recordings between the two men, saying: \"He's violated the trust that we had in him\". On Friday, Talking Points Memo published parts of a conversation the two had. . Mr Myers said he has not received any response to the letter from the House Ethics Committee, and that the Capitol Police told him a report would be ready on Monday, CBS reported. . \"These matters will hopefully be appropriately addressed by the police and the Ethics Committee, respectively in due time,\" Mr Myers said..

The World Health Organization has warned the toll may rise dramatically as rescuers find more victims. . As day breaks, rescue teams are stepping up their search for survivors.. Many people in the disaster zone have been too scared to go back into buildings.. The 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) on Monday at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep, according to the US Geological Survey. . Seismologists say it was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey, where at least 2,921 people are now known to have died. Survivors say it took two minutes for the shaking to stop.. A later tremor had a magnitude of 7.5 and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. . As dawn broke on Tuesday, traffic was at a standstill on the main highway to the Turkish city of Maras, close to the epicentre of the quake and believed to be one of the worst-affected areas. . Cars occasionally crawled forward, the wet road illuminated by glowing red brake lights.. Few rescuers have made it to this part of southern Turkey yet and everyone is trying to get there as fast as they can to assess the damage and give vital help.. One search and rescue team on their way to the city, their van loaded with specialist equipment and supplies, told the BBC they were eager to get there and start looking for survivors, but they had no idea how bad the devastation would be when they arrived.. Almost 8,000 people have been rescued from more than 4,700 destroyed buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said in its latest statement.. As aftershocks continue, rescuers in some areas have been digging through rubble with their bare hands looking for survivors. . But freezing conditions are hampering search efforts. .

My God... They're calling out. They're saying, 'Save us,' but we can't save them. How are we going to save them? There has been nobody since the morning.\". In the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, pouring rain hampered rescuers as they searched through the rubble looking for survivors.. The city was without power as the cold and rain set in.. One family camped on the street - despite the freezing temperatures - as they were scared of the aftershocks triggering another building to collapse.. Every time they felt an aftershock, the family moved closer into the middle of the street.. A hotel owner in the city told the BBC that of 14 guests staying that night, only seven had been found.. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment.. But the earthquake has caused significant damage to three airports across Turkey, also creating challenges for aid deliveries.. At least 1,400 people are now known to have been killed in Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on the Turkish border. . Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support.. UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an international response, saying that many of the families hit by the disaster were \"already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge\". . The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. The UK has said it will send 76 specialists, equipment and rescue dogs.. France, Germany, Israel and the US have also pledged to help.
