        "content": "On Sunday the struggling Credit Suisse was taken over by UBS in a Swiss . .. The US dollar liquidity \"swap line\" arrangement will run from Monday.. In a statement the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank launched the co-ordinated action to \"enhance the provision of liquidity\".. The announcement said it served as an \"important backstop to ease strains in global funding markets\" and to lessen the impact on the supply of credit to households and businesses.. Instead of borrowing on the open market, British banks will be able to go direct to the Bank of England, and it will borrow from the US Federal Reserve.. It will work in the same way for banks in the eurozone, Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the US. . Banks will be able to access this funding on a daily basis.. The arrangement, adopted during the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, will start on Monday and continue until \"at least through the end of April\", the Bank of England said.. Global banking stocks slumped following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, despite reassurances from President Joe Biden the US would do \"whatever is needed\" to protect the banking system.. Since SVB's collapse, the smaller Signature Bank also fell by the wayside and First Republic needed rescuing.. A subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp - Flagstar Bank - has reached a deal with regulators to buy Signature Bank assets, .  on Sunday.. The deal involves almost all of Signature Bank's deposits, some of its loans, and all 40 of its former branches.. The announcement of \"co-ordinated action\" by six of the world's biggest central banks shows how serious is the more general nervousness about the fragility of the global banking system. . The facility hasn't been used in the UK since the financial pains at the onset of the pandemic exactly three years ago. This is not as dramatic a move as, for example, the Bank of England had to deploy after the mini-budget last autumn. But it is a clear sign that, although the past week has been dominated by specific issues in identifiable banks, the fall of a former giant such as Credit Suisse might be enough to ignite a more general concern.. The fear is less about the direct impact of problems at Credit Suisse or Silicon Valley Bank, but instead that a set of common factors are affecting some other institutions. For example non-insured deposits pouring out of some institutions and into larger ones at incredible speed, without anyone visiting a branch, thanks to technology, and influenced by social media commentary. There has also been an uncertain response by some regulators.. The bigger picture is, as I have said before, that rapidly rising interest rates were always going to set off some ticking timebombs under some institutions, and in some murky corners of the financial plumbing, where the players had started to become a little too reliant on very low interest rates. This is now happening.. The more calming news is that, for example here, British banks are well capitalised and have significant funding, or as the Bank of England put it on Sunday \"safe and sound\". But the fact it has joined forces with its counterparts around the world represents a show of force and an attempt to prevent risks from spilling over. . In particular there is a concern that rising rates on the funds that banks lend to one another could rapidly filter into the economy and have a very real impact.. ",

The Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) says Mr Schulz is the person referred to as Soldier C in a 2020 ABC Four Corners documentary exposing alleged war crimes.. Footage showed Soldier C shooting an Afghan man in a wheat field in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in 2012.. The investigation was carried out by the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI), the body set up to investigate alleged war crimes following a four-year inquiry led by an Army Reserve major general and NSW Supreme Court judge Paul Brereton.. The Brereton Report - released in 2020 - found there was \"credible evidence\" that Australian elite soldiers unlawfully killed 39 people during the Afghan war. . It said 19 current or ex-special forces soldiers should be investigated by police over killings of \"prisoners, farmers or civilians\" from 2009 to 2013.. This is believed to be the first arrest linked to that inquiry. . At the time, the Australian Defence Force blamed crimes on an unchecked \"warrior culture\" among some soldiers.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Russia's President Putin tours Mariupol in occupied Ukraine. The BBC has traced part of the route he took, which passed near the locations of several notorious attacks during his army's months-long assault. Russia finally overran the city in May.. Video released by Russian media show Mr Putin chatting to a companion as they head towards the city's concert hall. The Kremlin says the visit took place late on Saturday and Mr Putin decided \"spontaneously\" to tour the city.. Mariupol's Ukrainian mayor in exile Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that Mariupol was \"personal\" to Mr Putin because of what had happened there.. \"We have to understand that Mariupol is a symbolic place for Putin, because of the fury he inflicted on the city of Mariupol. No other city was destroyed like that. No other city was under siege for so long. No other city was subjected to carpet bombing,\" he said. . \"He has come in person to see what he has done,\" he added.. The BBC identified some of the key landmarks along the Russian leader's route. Mr Putin appears to be driving down Kuprina St, turning into Myru Avenue and then into Metalurhiv Avenue, where the Philharmonic Concert Hall is and which he visits later on in the footage. . He is sitting next to a man in a black cap, who Russian media identify as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin. . On his left as they drive down Myru Avenue are sculptures of birds in what was Mariupol's Freedom Square.. Further on, on the right and not shown in the footage, is Mariupol's Maternity Hospital Number Three, which was bombed in a notorious incident last March.. Pictures of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps were widely shared amid outrage at the attack. She survived and gave birth the following day. Another pregnant woman was among the victims.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a war crime but Russia's embassy in London claimed the hospital had no longer been in use, and was instead being used by members of the Azov regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia with links to the far right in 2014 but had since been incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard.. Mr Putin turned off Myru Avenue just before the road arrives at Theatre Square - the scene of a deadly bombing that is thought to have killed at least 300 and possibly as many as 600 civilians.. Civilians had been using the building as a refuge from the siege and a large sign spelling \"children\" had been daubed in Russian in front of the theatre. The building collapsed when it was hit. Russia denied bombing it and blamed the Azov battalion. In December the Ukrainian city authorities in exile said . . . Russia \"understood where there was a concentration of people, and deliberately destroyed these places, killing people. They systematically worked on this\", said Mr Boychenko.. Footage then shows Mr Putin on a walking tour of a new residential compound, said to be in Mariupol's Nevsky district. He is guided by Mr Khusnullin, who shows him some plans of the reconstruction work. He is also seen talking to people said by Russian media to be local residents and he also visits an apartment that he is told is made up of three rooms. . Nevsky is a new district comprising a dozen apartment blocks in the west of the city. It is named after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands.. Mayor Boychenko said many of the Russian-built buildings were on the city outskirts. \"They built this just to prove that their version of what's happening there is true. But they lie! They lie that they came to liberate the city. But they destroyed it. This city does not exist any longer. And it takes 20 years to restore it!\" he said.. Mariupol residents have been telling the BBC that new buildings are going up and some of those damaged by the Russian military are being removed. The UN estimates that 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the Russian onslaught.. Norwegian journalist Morten Risberg, who visited Mariupol in December, said he saw \"large-scale rebuilding and restoration\" amid \"destruction everywhere you looked\".. \"They're changing street names and they're painting over Ukrainian colours with Russian colours, and they're putting Russian flags everywhere,\" he told the BBC. Most of the remaining civilians in the city were \"just focusing on surviving\", he said. . In another part of the footage, President Putin is seen walking through the interior of a concert hall in Mariupol. Russian state media said it was the Philharmonic Concert Hall - and the BBC has verified that the footage matches the interior of the venue. . This is the same building that .  was to be used to stage trials of Ukrainian troops who held out against Russian forces for months in Mariupol's massive Azovstal iron and steel plant. Russia finally gained complete control of Mariupol in May after the defenders surrendered.. Images posted on social media in August - including by Ukrainian authorities - appeared to show metal cages being built on the stage. According to the UN, prosecuting prisoners of war (POWs) for taking part in hostilities is a war crime.. But the trials never took place, as the POWs were later part of .  for 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including a pro-Kremlin former MP, Viktor Medvedchuk.. The latest footage from inside the concert hall shows the interior of the building has since been redecorated and the cages are no longer visible.. During the siege the concert hall, like the drama theatre, was used by civilians for shelter. The cultural institutions were \"where people hid in basements and waited for the Russian terror to end,\" Mr Boychenko said.. Before the invasion it had been the venue for the Mariupol Classic festival for classical music. Mr Boychenko said the festival was a \"great celebration of classical music for the people of Mariupol\" that drew artists from abroad and other parts of Ukraine.. \"Many people always gathered at this festival to feel the mood that always prevailed in Mariupol,\" he said.. In a later shot, President Putin is seen visiting a World War Two memorial built to commemorate Soviet troops who recaptured the city from Nazi Germany.. ",
