        "content": "Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. Mr Biden, who did not offer further details, is facing intense pressure domestically to shoot the object down. . Officials advised against such a move due to the danger of falling debris.. Later on Saturday the US Federal Aviation Administration said it had stopped traffic at three airports \"in support of a national security effort\".. One of the affected airports is Myrtle Beach International in South Carolina - the state the balloon was said to be heading towards.. The FAA has also closed airspace off the South Carolina coast. Tracking website Flightradar24 showed US Air Force and Coastguard aircraft operating in the skies between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Myrtle Beach.. The balloon's arrival over the US comes amid fraying tensions between Washington and Beijing, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling off a trip to Beijing over the matter.. Mr Blinken said the \"surveillance\" balloon's presence was \"an irresponsible act\". However, China - which says it is a weather ship blown astray - has urged \"cool-headed\" handling of the dispute.. The giant white balloon was last spotted over Missouri and is expected to reach the east coast of the US near the Carolinas during the weekend.. In another development, the US reported a second Chinese balloon floating over Latin America on Friday.. China, which has expressed regret over the incident, said on Saturday it had \"never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country\".. In a statement, its foreign ministry played down the cancellation of Mr Blinken's visit and said neither side had formally announced such a plan. . It added that Beijing \"would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype\" and accused \"some politicians and media in the United States\" of using the incident \"as a pretext to attack and smear China.\". According to US officials, the balloon floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.. The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon's presence was \"a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law\" and \"an irresponsible act\" on the eve of his visit to China.. America's top diplomat had been set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. It would have been the first high-level US-China meeting there in years.. But plans faltered after US defence officials announced they were tracking a giant surveillance balloon over the US on Thursday.. While the Pentagon said the balloon was \"travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic\" and did \"not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground\", its presence has sparked outrage.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. And late on Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. China has so far made no public comments on the reported second balloon.. ",

        "content": "The proposed $72bn (Â£60bn) buyout never materialised.. If found liable, Musk could have been ordered to pay out billions in damages.. It took the nine jurors less than two hours to reach their verdict on the class-action lawsuit on Friday afternoon. . Mr Musk - who had wanted the trial moved to Texas, where Tesla is based, arguing he could not get a fair trial in San Francisco - welcomed the outcome.. Taking to Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44bn last October, he posted: \"Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!. \"I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.\". Central to the lawsuit was Mr Musk's tweet on 7 August 2018: \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\". The plaintiffs also argued Mr Musk had lied when he tweeted later in the day that \"investor support is confirmed\".. The stock price surged after the tweets, but fell back again within days as it became clear the deal would not go through.. According to an economist hired by the shareholders, investor losses were calculated as high as $12bn, after many made decisions about buying and selling their shares based on the tweet.  . The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mr Musk over his tweets, accusing him of lying to investors. Mr Musk agreed to step aside as Tesla board chairman and settled for $20m.. During the three-week trial, Mr Musk - who also leads SpaceX and Twitter - had argued he thought he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund for the deal.. During his nearly nine hours on the witness stand, the world's second-richest man said: \"Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.\". Shareholders had argued that \"funding secured\" suggested more than a verbal agreement. . Although Tesla's share price shot up after the tweet was posted, Mr Musk also questioned whether his tweets had any effect on Tesla's share price. . \"At one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high... and it went higher, which is counterintuitive,\" he said - arguing the effect his tweets have on the stock price can be unpredictable. . Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan to take Tesla private after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded.. He was not in court when the verdict was read, but he was present during closing arguments earlier on Friday as duelling portraits were drawn of him by the rival legal teams.. Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders, said: \"Our society is based on rules. We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else.\". Mr Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said: \"Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud.\". After the verdict, Mr Porritt said: \"We are disappointed with the verdict and are considering next steps.\". Mr Musk was generally calm during his testimony - though at times he appeared annoyed at the line of questioning. . There were also times of levity. After a lawyer representing shareholders accidentally called Elon Musk \"Mr Tweet\", Elon Musk promptly changed his name on Twitter to the same moniker. . Several Tesla directors also testified, including James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. They testified that Mr Musk did not need the Tesla board to review buyout tweets. . Securities fraud lawyer Reed Kathrein called the tweet about taking Tesla private \"as concrete a statement of taking a company private as there can be\", and said the not guilty verdict was \"a travesty to investors and the securities laws\".  .

        "content": "No indication has been given as to when they will be handed to British embassy staff to be flown home.. The families of the men said they were killed during a humanitarian rescue.. The two volunteers were last seen heading to the city of Soledar on 6 January. . Mr Bagshaw's family said the pair were attempting to help an elderly woman when their cars were hit by a shell.. Soledar had been the focus of intense fighting and last month Russia's military claimed to have captured the Ukrainian salt-mine town after a long battle. The government in Kyiv disputed the claim.. Despite the continued fighting in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's chief of staff, said 116 Ukrainian soldiers had been released on Saturday.. He said released prisoners included defenders of Mariupol, partisans from Kherson and snipers from Bakhmut, as well as two personnel from special operations.. Russia's defence ministry said 63 servicemen had been returned as part of a \"complex mediation process\".. It said it included people of a \"sensitive category\" thanks to the mediation of the United Arab Emirates, though it did not specify what those people did. . It is the second prisoner swap carried out between the two countries so far this year. . Mr Yermak said Ukraine is continuing efforts to bring everyone home.. Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw had been in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine doing voluntary work.. This video can not be played. Watch: Archive video shows Chris Parry and Andrew Bagshaw. In a statement issued by the UK Foreign Office last month, Mr Parry's family said his \"selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged\" in Ukraine had made them \"extremely proud\".. \"We never imagined we would be saying goodbye to Chris when he had such a full life ahead of him. He was a caring son, fantastic brother, a best friend to so many and a loving partner to Olga,\" they said.. They added that Mr Parry, originally from Truro in Cornwall, \"found himself drawn to Ukraine in March in its darkest hour at the start of the Russian invasion and helped those most in need, saving over 400 lives plus many abandoned animals.\". Scientific researcher Mr Bagshaw was a British national but lived in New Zealand. He had been a volunteer in Ukraine since April.. In a statement, Mr Bagshaw's family said last month: \"Andrew selflessly took many personal risks and saved many lives; we love him and are very proud indeed of what he did.. \"The world needs to be strong and stand with Ukraine, giving them the military support they need now, and help to rebuild their shattered country after the war.\". Another foreign national volunteering in Ukraine, Pete Reed, was killed in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut - the location of heavy fighting in recent days - on Thursday. . Mr Reed, a 33-year-old American volunteer aid worker, was killed \"while rendering aid,\" according to a statement from the humanitarian aid group he founded, Global Response Medicine.. The UK government has previously warned against all travel to Ukraine, saying there is \"a real risk to life\".. British nationals still in Ukraine should leave immediately if it is safe to do so, it added.. ",

        "content": "Mr Arai also warned that permitting gay marriage in Japan would lead to many abandoning the country.. Mr Kishida said the remarks were \"outrageous\" and \"completely incompatible\" with his government's policies.. Japan - a country still largely bound by traditional gender roles and family values - is the only G7 nation that does not recognise same-sex marriage.. However, recent polling suggests most Japanese support gay marriage.. A number of same-sex couples have also filed lawsuits across Japan in recent years arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage violates the country's constitution.. Prior to Mr Arai's dismissal, Mr Kishida had talked about issues surrounding same-sex marriage in parliament.. He stated that it needed to be carefully considered because of its potential impact on traditional family structures.. Mr Arai reacted to the remarks afterwards, telling reporters that he \"wouldn't like it if [LGBT couples] lived next door\" and \"doesn't even want to look at them.\". He added that it would \"change the way society is\" and \"quite a few people would abandon this country,\" according to Kyodo News.. In response, Mr Kishida said he had dismissed Mr Arai, adding: \"We have been respecting diversity and realising an inclusive society.\". Mr Arai later apologised, stating that his remarks were not appropriate and were not representative of the prime minister's views.. His resignation represents a further blow to Mr Kishida, whose government has seen plummeting approval ratings after a number of his ministers have resigned over various scandals in recent months..
