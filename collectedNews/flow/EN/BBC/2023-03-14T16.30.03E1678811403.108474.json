        "content": ". . Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the cuts would be \"tough\", and formed part of a \"year of efficiency\".. In addition to the 10,000 jobs being lost, 5,000 open roles at the company will be left unfilled.. Mr Zuckerberg told staff in a memo he believed the company had suffered \"a humbling wake-up call\" in 2022 when it saw a slowdown in revenue.. Meta .  that, in the three months to December 2022, earnings were down 4% year-on-year - though it still managed to make a profit of more than $23bn over the course of 2022.. Mr Zuckerberg cited higher interest rates in the US, global geopolitical instability and increased regulation as some of the factors affecting Meta.. \"I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,\" he said.. The cuts come as companies including Google and Amazon have been grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive.. At the start of this year, Amazon announced it planned to close more than 18,000 jobs because of \"the uncertain economy\" and rapid hiring during pandemic, while Google's parent company Alphabet made 12,000 cuts.. According to layoffs.fyi, which tracks job losses in the tech sector, there have been more than 128,000 job cuts in the tech industry so far in 2023. . Mr Zuckerberg said the recruitment team would be the first to be told whether they were affected by the cuts, and would find out on Wednesday. He also outlined when other teams would know about their futures.. \"We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April 2023, and then our business groups in late May 2023,\" he wrote . . . \"In a small number of cases, it may take through to the end of the year to complete these changes. . \"Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details.\". Sadly, we're getting used to hearing about big tech layoffs, as the giants continue to tighten their belts. Many like Meta make most of their money from carrying advertising. . And now they're faced with a perfect storm of falling ad revenues from companies with their own bills to pay, and a user base which has less money to spend, making existing ad space less valuable. . It's interesting to note that Meta is looking to its recruitment team in the latest round of cuts. . I often hear that Silicon Valley firms have a tendency to over-recruit, for two reasons. Firstly, so they have staff ready to handle sudden enormous growth, which can happen (just look at TikTok), and secondly, to hire and retain those they perceive to be \"top tech talent\", and who they do not want working for their rivals instead. Both are luxuries, it seems, that are no longer affordable.. Meta has the added risk of Mark Zuckerberg's enormous gamble on the metaverse being The Next Big Thing. If he's right, his firm will regain its crown, but if he's wrong, the $15bn+ dollars he has spent on it so far could disappear in a puff of mixed reality smoke.. Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no new hires until the restructuring was complete, and said he aimed to make the company \"flatter\" by \"removing multiple layers of management\".. He also dedicated a section of the correspondence to hybrid work, and said software engineers who joined Meta in-person performed better than those who joined remotely - indicating that this would change as part of the company's \"year of efficiency\".. \"Engineers earlier in their career perform better on average when they work in-person with teammates at least three days a week,\" he added.. \"We're focusing on understanding this further and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively. . \"In the meantime, I encourage all of you to find more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person.\".

        "content": "The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January.. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington.. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an \"epidemic\".. But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives.. Mr Biden's executive order  - a law a US president can enact without Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks.. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: \"While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.\". The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over \"red flag\" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it \"would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives\", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will \"double down on the progress made\" in last year's bill..
