        "content": "The centrist president's victory over Marine Le Pen may have been convincing, but he has a problem. There are new elections around the corner to France's National Assembly and a big section of the electorate dislikes him.. \"There is a lot of hate,\" sociologist Michel Wieviorka told the BBC. \"He said last night 'I am happy' but I don't think he can be totally happy because there are plenty of clouds in his sky.\". Politically, if he fares badly in the June elections, he could end up losing his majority and may not be able to form his own government. That's why his opponents are calling the next vote a \"third round\".. Why would that matter if he's just won 58.5% of the national vote? . Many of his voters are not natural supporters and are unlikely to back him in June. A large number of far-left voters held their noses to keep the far right out of power, but then there are also a number of mainstream parties that threw their weight behind him too, including the Republicans, Greens and Socialists.. One opinion poll indicated that 63% of voters would rather he lost his majority and had to share power with an opposition government, known in France as \"co-habitation\".. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has designs on becoming prime minister himself. If that were to happen, there would be little love lost between him and the president. He claimed that Mr Macron had won the vote with the worst result in French history. Even if he was wrong, it was still a valid point that more than a third of voters had either stayed away from the election or voted for no candidate at all.. France's election winner is therefore a man in a hurry. He wants to rush through important reforms to persuade a jaded electorate to vote for his party. . Within days, he needs to form a new government, replacing Prime Minister Jean Castex, who led France through the Covid pandemic. . Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne is seen as a popular choice, because she has a strong record on social issues and it is social reforms that are his priority right now. . Mr Macron is also believed to want a woman in the job.. And she seems to understand the need for speed - especially when it comes to the issue which dominated both rounds of the presidential election: the cost of living that is causing a headache across French society and became the focus of Marine Le Pen's campaign.. \"We need to provide quick answers,\" she said.. Indeed, within hours of the election result, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised to keep in place a price cap on gas and electricity price rises until the end of 2022. . But spending is just one of four priorities Macron needs to push in the coming weeks, according to Junior Economy Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher.  The environment, education, and health are also key, with green issues a particular priority for younger voters. . And don't forget, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds did not bother to vote on Sunday.. But the flagship reform Macron is really determined to push through is controversial: raising the pension age from 62 to 65.. However, government spokesman Gabriel Attal has promised the Macron administration is in listening mode. . He insisted there would be a change of approach over the next five years, and on pensions they would redouble consultation to \"hear people's anxieties\". . Asking the French people to work three more years before they collect their pensions is not exactly a popular move, so Mr Macron is at pains to say he is flexible on how it is brought in and when. And yet his finance minister did not rule out forcing it through without a vote if they had to.. For a president sometimes dubbed Jupiter for perceived arrogance, observers see this as a critical moment for him to adapt.. \"He must accept the idea that negotiation is important, it doesn't mean top-down decisions,\" says Michel Wieviorka. \"I think it's difficult for him psychologically and culturally to change to a more democratic way of politics.\". In his victory speech, Mr Macron declared he was no longer a candidate in one camp but the president for everybody. No-one would be left by the wayside, he vowed. . He also insisted that the next five years would be handled differently from the last, without explaining how. He may not have long to prove it.. The Olympic champion who turned his back on Putin. The surprising benefits of this humble veg. Take a peek at the gruelling challenges they'll face!. ",

        "content": "Many Twitter users are also asking whether this means accounts suspended by the company will be allowed back.. The most high-profile person to have been suspended was Donald Trump.. After the news of the deal was announced, human rights groups raised concerns about hate speech on Twitter and the power it would give Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\".. He has been vocal in his criticism of the platform's policies on moderating content, arguing that Twitter needs to be a genuine forum for free speech.. In a statement after striking the deal he described free speech as \"the bedrock of a functioning democracy\".. In a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\". Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.. Donald Trump's account was terminated permanently last year in the wake of the 6 January riots at the Capitol building in Washington.. But even if his Twitter ban is reversed, Mr Trump says he does not plan to return to Twitter, instead opting to use his own platform, Truth Social. . \"I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,\" Mr Trump told Fox News. . He added that he believed Mr Musk, who he called a \"good man\", will \"make improvements\" to the platform. . Representatives of Mr Trump did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. Ming-Chi Kuo, a technology analyst at investment management firm TF International Securities, told the BBC that Mr Trump may decide to return to the platform if he runs in the 2024 US presidential election.. \"Twitter is still a better choice for him to have a voice, if Twitter is willing to restore his account,\" Mr Kuo said. . \"It's not easy to build a platform with more influence than Twitter before the next presidential election.\". Mr Musk said that he hopes that even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". . However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". . \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers.. Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". . \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added.. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". . \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said.  . The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer. . Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and still sits on its board, said he was happy the platform \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", even though he does not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\".. \"It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company,\" Mr Dorsey said in a tweet on Tuesday.. \"Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust,\" Mr Dorsey added. \"I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.\". Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain, according to the Reuters news agency.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. . On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", whoever owns or runs Twitter.. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\".. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as \"an encouraging day for freedom of speech\". . This video can not be played.
