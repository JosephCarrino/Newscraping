        "content": "Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. A local official says . .. But Deputy Mayor Oleksandr Marchenko said at the weekend that Russia had not yet gained control of the city.. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner private army involved in the Russian campaign, .  amid apparent friction between his fighters and regular Russian forces. . He also says his representative had been barred from a Russian military headquarters.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin. . Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine it annexed last September after referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Mr Zelensky said in his evening address that he had discussed Bakhmut with senior generals..  \"[They] responded not to withdraw, but to strengthen [our defences],\" he said..  \"The command unanimously supported this position. There were no other positions. I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut.\". The comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that armed forces commander Valery Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.. Most defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.. And at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were .  while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.. Ground forces commander Olexandr Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".. \"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\".

        "content": "Unicef estimates that more than one billion women and adolescent girls worldwide are malnourished.. It says recent crises including war and Covid have made it increasingly hard for them to get the food they need.. Unicef has urged the international community to make food security a priority, including supporting failing nutrition programmes. . It stressed the impact the malnutrition is having on children's health..  found that the one billion undernourished women and adolescent girls were \"underweight and of short stature\" as a result, according to data analysis of women in most countries in the world.. It also found that they suffered from a deficiency in essential micronutrients as well as from anaemia.. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa \"remain the epicentre of the nutrition crisis among adolescent girls and women\", the report said.. It found that 68% of women and adolescent girls there were underweight, and 60% of those suffered from anaemia.. \"Inadequate nutrition during girls' and women's lives can lead to weakened immunity, poor cognitive development, and an increased risk of life-threatening complications - including during pregnancy and childbirth,\" Unicef said.. Malnutrition could also have \"dangerous and irreversible consequences for their children's survival, growth, learning, and future earning capacity\", it added.. \"Globally, 51 million children under two years are stunted. We estimate that about half of these children become stunted during pregnancy and the first six months of life, when a child is fully dependent on the mother for nutrition,\" it said.. Unicef estimates that between 2020 and 2022, the number of pregnant or breastfeeding women suffering from acute malnutrition increased from 5.5 to 6.9 million in the 12 countries deemed to be in food crisis.. These are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Chad and Yemen.. \"Without urgent action from the international community, the consequences could last for generations to come,\" said Unicef chief executive Catherine Russell.. \"To prevent undernutrition in children, we must also address malnutrition in adolescent girls and women,\" she added.. Unicef called for mandatory legal measures to \"expand large-scale food fortification of routinely consumed foods such as flour, cooking oil and salt\" to help reduce micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in girls and women..
