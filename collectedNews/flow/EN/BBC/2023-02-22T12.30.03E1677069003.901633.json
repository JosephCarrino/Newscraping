        "content": "Schools have been shut and traffic has been suspended in 10 regions.. Earlier, Freddy caused some damage in Mauritius, flooding beachside hotels.. The Indian Ocean island nation is particularly vulnerable to cyclones. It is hit by an average of 1.5 cyclones every year, the highest rate in Africa, according to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.. The cyclone slightly weakened once it made landfall on Madagascar, situated off the south-east coast of Africa, with wind gusts exceeding 130km/h (81mph). The country's meteorological service warned that torrential rains would continue along its path. . \"The sea remains very rough... and a significant risk of coastal flooding will continue overnight,\" it said. . A 27-year-old man drowned near the port of Mahanoro before the storm made landfall, officials said. . Officials also said 7,000 people had been pre-emptively evacuated from the coastal region directly in Freddy's path, and warnings waves could reach over 8m (26ft) were issued by the International Federation of Red Cross. . Some people used sandbags to weigh down their roofs as a precaution, but that didn't stop the storm from ripping roofs off houses.. \"All the doors and windows started shaking,\" said Tahina, a resident of Mananjary, a coastal town of around 25,000 people 30km from where the cyclone first made landfall.. She had fled her home with her parents and three children to shelter in her husband's office.. \"Next to us, at least five houses have lost their roofs,\" Tahina told AFP news agency.. Pascal Salle sobbed as he surveyed the damage caused by Freddy - which had ripped a window off of his home and turned his garden into a \"sandy field\".. \"It's a repeat performance. I can't take this every year, it's not possible. Batsirai and Emnati in 2022, Freddy in 2023... Who's to say that in 15 days another one won't fall on us?\" he said.. Last month the powerful storm Cheneso smashed into north-eastern Madagascar bringing in heavy winds and triggering downpours that caused extensive flooding, and killing at least 33 people and forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.. Mananjary is still recovering from devastation caused by last year's Cyclone Batsirai, which killed more than 130 people across Madagascar.. Cyclone Freddy is forecast to cross the ocean from Madagascar and make landfall in Mozambique, before potentially moving further inland to hit Zimbabwe, UN officials say. . The body estimates that more than two million people could be affected.. ",

        "content": "Putin won't surrender easily, says US diplomat John Sullivan. John Sullivan was America's man in Moscow in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. . The former US ambassador is the one who had conversations with Russian officials about trying to prevent a war, but \"there was no engagement\", he said. . \"They demanded security guarantees for Russia but wouldn't talk constructively about security for Ukraine. They never moved beyond their talking pointsâ€¦ it was a charade.\" . When I ask whether the US should work harder at continuing those conversations to try to end the conflict, he tells me that President Vladimir Putin \"wasn't interested in negotiating before the war. He's still not interested in negotiating\". . Instead, the Biden administration has focused on rallying global support for arming Ukraine and sanctioning Russia, itself shipping billions of dollars of weapons to the country. . In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Putin repeated his view that the West had started the war, that it was using Ukraine to try to inflict a \"strategic defeat\" on Moscow, and that Russia, not Ukraine, was fighting for its very existence. . Despite the failures of Moscow's self-declared special military operation, Mr Sullivan says the goals initially declared by the Kremlin remain the same - to \"de-Nazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine. He interprets that as \"removing the government in Kyiv and subjugating the Ukrainian people\".. This is part of a vision that President Putin has outlined to re-gather the Russian peoples that were separated by the collapse of the Soviet Union. . \"He can't have a democratically elected government, particularly one led by President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, in Kyiv,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He will never be satisfied as long as that government exists because he considers it a threat to Russia and to his vision of this larger Russian state he's trying to create.\"  . So what, then, would it take for Mr Putin to stop the war? . \"He has to be convinced that he can't win,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He's going to double down until he's convinced that there's just no way he can win. I'm not sure how significant the battlefield setbacks have to be for him to reach that point, but he's nowhere near that today.\" . This video can not be played. Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. Mr Sullivan says the Russian leader has a long-time horizon, and \"a vision for what he wants to accomplish that he will not surrender easily\". . Neither, though, will the Ukrainians, Mr Sullivan believes, declaring one of the strategic failures of Mr Putin's war to be alienating the Slavic nation of 44 million people.. \"The Ukrainian people aren't going to forgive and forget,\" he says. \"Even if President Zelenksy wanted to end the war, wanted to make territorial concessions, basically wanted to surrender, the Ukrainian people wouldn't let him.\" . With such a military, political and ideological standoff, the US has to be prepared for a long war. . President Joe Biden underlined America's commitment by making a surprise visit to Kyiv on the anniversary of the invasion, but Mr Sullivan does not expect the conflict to end this year. . \"Beyond that I don't know,\" he says. \"But [Mr Putin] doesn't want an off-ramp. The goals of this special military operation will be achieved. He says that all the time.\" . ",

        "content": "Failure to comply would make migrants ineligible if they subsequently reach the border. . Pro-migrant groups likened the plan to Trump-era policies.. Tuesday's proposed measure is the toughest to curtail immigration yet introduced by Mr Biden, a Democrat who came into office promising a more humane approach to the border crisis than the administration of his predecessor. . The proposed rule would only apply to adults and families, but not to unaccompanied children. . Under the plan, migrants would have to use a phone app to make an appointment to speak with a US immigration official when they arrive at the border. . Those who failed to make the appointment would be presumed to have been found ineligible for asylum in the other countries they passed through. . The proposal - issued jointly by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice - allows for those undocumented migrants to be swiftly deported. . If approved, it would be enacted on 11 May, when Title 42 - a Trump-era health emergency provision allowing migrants to be expelled back to Mexico - is due to expire. . The Biden policy would remain in place for two years with the option of extending it. . The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would sue to block the rule from ever taking effect.. The organisation compared the plan to actions previously taken by former President Donald Trump that were ruled unconstitutional in the courts. . Oxfam America said: \"This sweeping asylum ban will shut the door to countless refugees seeking safety and protection in the United States.\" . But an unnamed Biden administration official told AFP news agency: \"This administration will not allow mass chaos and disorder at the border because of Congress's failure to act.\". The public has 30 days to comment on the draft proposal.. About 200,000 undocumented migrants attempt to enter the US each month, recent government records show. . This video can not be played.

        "content": "Advocates of the ban say that it is needed to prevent caste bias from becoming more prevalent in the US. . The caste system in India dates back over 3,000 years and divides Hindu society into rigid hierarchical groups.. The ordinance passed by Seattle on Tuesday follows similar bans on caste bias that have been introduced on the campuses of US universities in recent years. . \"Caste discrimination doesn't only take place in other countries,\" said Ms Sawant, who is the only Indian American on the Seattle city council. . \"It is faced by South Asian American and other immigrant working people in their workplaces, including in the tech sector, in Seattle and in cities around the country.\". Ms Sawant, a socialist, has previously spoken of being raised in an upper-caste Hindu Brahmin household in India and witnessing such discrimination.. The measure has been opposed by some Hindu American groups, who argue a ban is not necessary as US law already prohibits such discrimination. . In an open letter, the Washington DC-based Hindu American Federation said that while the ordinance's goals were praiseworthy, it \"unfairly singles out and targets an entire community on the basis of their national origin and ancestry for disparate treatment\".. They added that Indian Americans made up less than 2% of Washington state's population, and argued there was little evidence of any widespread discrimination based on caste.. Caste discrimination has been banned in India since 1948, however, discrimination continues, especially against the Dalits, who were once called \"untouchables\".. According to the Migration Policy Institute think tank, the US is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad. . ",
