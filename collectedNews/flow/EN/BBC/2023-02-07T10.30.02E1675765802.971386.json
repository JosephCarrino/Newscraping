        "content": "Other energy firms have seen similar rises, with Shell reporting record earnings of nearly $40bn last week.. The profits have led to calls for energy firms to pay more tax as many households struggle with rising bills.. BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was \"helping provide the energy the world needs\" and investing the transition to green energy.. Energy prices had begun to climb following the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply in March last year after Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about global supplies.. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel, but has since fallen back to about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs. . It has led to bumper profits for energy companies, but also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses. . Last year, the ministers introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - on the \"extraordinary\" profits being made at energy companies.. The rate was originally set at 25%, but has now been increased to 35%, and only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. . BP said its UK business, which accounts for less than 10% of its global profits, will pay $2.2bn in tax for 2022, including $700m due to the Energy Profits Levy. . Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the windfall tax struck the \"right balance\" between helping families with the cost of living and securing the UK's energy supplies. He said its aim was to encourage re-investment of the sector's profits back into the economy. Nick Butler, previously a senior executive at BP and now a visiting professor at Kings College, who the BBC spoke to because of his knowledge of gas companies, said oil and gas prices would not remain \"exceptionally high\" forever. . \"This is a temporary situation. Oil and gas prices are going down and the windfall these companies are making won't last until 2023.\". But Labour's shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband said the profits were \"outrageous\" and called on the government increase the windfall tax. . The government has had to step in to limit household energy bills, with the average home now paying £2,500 a year, although this is still more than double what it was a year ago.. The cap on bills will also rise to £3,000 from April, . As well as announcing record profits, BP increased its payout to shareholders by 10%.. It also scaled back plans to reduce its oil and gas output by 2030. The company - which was one of the first oil and gas giants to announce an ambition to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 - had previously promised that emissions would be 35-40% lower by the end of this decade.. However, on Tuesday it said it was now targeting a 20-30% cut, saying it needed to keep investing in oil and gas to meet current demands.. But climate campaign group Greenpeace said the oil firm's new strategy would continue to damage the planet.. BP's results follow similarly strong profits announced by rivals Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron last week.. ",

        "content": "A job offer to Mr Myers was later rescinded, and Mr Santos told news outlet Semafor he was concerned by wiretapping charges faced by the aide during previous work as a journalist.. The accusations are the latest in a series of controversies for Mr Santos. . The BBC has reached out to the congressman's office for comment.. On Twitter on Friday, Mr Myers said he had filed a complaint to the Capitol police and wrote a letter to the House ethics committee, which can investigate violations of House rules, related to incidents he claims took place during his brief time working in Mr Santos's office. . The letter, which he posted online, details his allegations against Mr Santos. He said he was offered a job late last month in the Long Island congressman's office as his staff assistant. . The 34-year-old has faced growing calls to resign after he admitted fabricating parts of his resume and biography since his election in New York last year.. He is also facing multiple investigations over his campaign spending and financial reports. He has previously denied wrongdoing.. According to Mr Myers, on 25 January, Mr Santos asked him if he had a profile on Grindr, a popular LGBT dating app. Mr Santos then allegedly informed him that he had a profile on Grindr, Mr Myers said.. On a separate occasion the same day, Mr Myers was alone with Mr Santos in the congressman's office sorting mail.. \"He called me 'buddy' and insisted I sit next to him on the sofa,\" Mr Myers wrote. \"I proceeded to move forward with a discussion about the mail, but the congressman stopped me by placing his hand on my left leg, near my knee.\" . Mr Myers claimed the congressman then invited him to karaoke, which he declined, and proceeded to \"take his hand and move it down my leg into my inner-thigh\", where he \"touched\" his groin.. Next, Mr Myers said Mr Santos told him that his husband was away for the night and invited him to come over.. \"I quickly pushed the congressman's hand away and grabbed the mail from the table and proceeded to discuss the topic of constituent correspondence,\" Mr Myers wrote. . Mr Myers was working under the status of \"volunteer\" at the time of the incident, he said, something he told was necessary as he waited for his new-hire paperwork to process through the payroll department. This was something he said he later learned was against House rules. . On Monday, 30 January, Mr Myers said he was called into Mr Santos' office and asked about his background as a journalist, matters that Mr Myers said had already been discussed prior to receiving a job offer. . Last year, he was charged with wiretapping while working as a journalist in Ohio after publishing audio of court testimony submitted by a courthouse source. . . . According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Mr Myers said he pleaded not guilty to the charges and the case was automatically dismissed under Ohio's criminal rules of procedure after no indictment was brought within 60 days. . Mr Myers said his job offer in Mr Santos's office was rescinded on 1 February.  . Last week, Mr Santos told Semafor he expected a progressive news website to publish recordings between the two men, saying: \"He's violated the trust that we had in him\". On Friday, Talking Points Memo published parts of a conversation the two had. . Mr Myers said he has not received any response to the letter from the House Ethics Committee, and that the Capitol Police told him a report would be ready on Monday, CBS reported. . \"These matters will hopefully be appropriately addressed by the police and the Ethics Committee, respectively in due time,\" Mr Myers said..
