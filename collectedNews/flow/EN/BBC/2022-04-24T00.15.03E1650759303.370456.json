        "content": "It follows four attacks across Afghanistan on Thursday - all claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). . The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a key security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.. No-one has admitted carrying out Friday's attack in Kunduz, which came as worshippers gathered to pray. . A local shopkeeper told AFP news agency: \"The sight at the mosque was horrifying.\". The explosion was similar to Thursday's bomb which tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 31 people  and wounding 87. . Thursday's attack in Kunduz killed four people and wounded 18. . Admitting those attacks, IS said it was part of an ongoing global campaign to \"avenge\" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman.. Bomb attacks in Afghanistan have declined considerably since the Taliban came to power last August following the withdrawal of US and other Western forces after 20 years in the country.. IS does not control any territory in Afghanistan, but since their rivals, the Taliban, took power, they have been carrying out attacks in areas where they previously never had a presence, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Pakistan.. Sufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in the region for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.. IS militants also target the Taliban, with whom they have a fierce rivalry.. Responding to the attacks, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described the perpetrators as \"evil elements\", adding \"serious efforts are being made to arrest and punish them\".. The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Ramiz Alakbarov said the attacks this week were \"a painful reminder of the insecurity and dangers facing the Afghan people daily\". . \"The indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, which has already caused more than 100 civilian casualties this week, is unacceptable and must cease immediately,\" Mr Alakbarov said in a statement on Friday. .

Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak.. The .  features audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading.. \"This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,\" another man says.. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat.. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites.. It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown.. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures include .  to prevent those with the virus from leaving and . .. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that \"even the ceiling isn't finished yet\" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into.. \"Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,\" she said.. Other residents shout out \"thank you, big whites!\" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules.. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators.. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: \"The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!\" . \"Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,\" another commentator wrote.. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city.. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free.. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged..
