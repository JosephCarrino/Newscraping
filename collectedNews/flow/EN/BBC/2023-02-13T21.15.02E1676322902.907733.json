        "content": "She suffered minor injuries and later gave birth to a boy, Adnan, at a hospital in Afrin supported by the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams).. They returned to the house, only for it to collapse fully three days later.. Adnan was brought back to Afrin's al-Shifa Hospital by rescuers in a critical condition, suffering from severe dehydration and jaundice, while Dima was treated for a serious lower limb injury.. Dr Abdulkarim Hussein al-Ibrahim, a paediatrician, told the BBC via WhatsApp on Monday that the baby was responding well to treatment.. \"Adnan's condition... has significantly improved,\" he said. \"We are just feeding him and [providing] the rest of his needs through intravenous drips.\". Video footage released by Sams showed Adnan sleeping peacefully inside an incubator with his wrist hooked up to a drip.. Dima has been discharged from hospital once again and is living in a tent along with her husband, Abdul Majid, and their nine other children. She has been travelling to Afrin to visit Adnan in hospital every day. . Her family was forced to return to her partially destroyed home after she gave birth because there was no alternative shelter available in Jindayris, one of the worst-hit towns in opposition-held north-western Syria.. They have also not received any other aid since the earthquake, like thousands of others who have been affected.. Even before the disaster, 4.1 million people - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive in the region, which is the last bastion of the jihadists and rebels who have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad for 12 years. . But as of Sunday, only 52 lorries carrying aid from UN agencies had arrived from Turkey via Bab al-Hawa in Idlib province - the sole border crossing that the UN is authorised to use to deliver humanitarian assistance. . The deliveries had been scheduled before the earthquake and were delayed by damaged roads and other logistical issues, which meant they have not included the heavy machinery and other specialist equipment needed by the White Helmets, whose first responders operate in opposition-held areas. . Dr Ibrahim said there was an acute shortage of the medicines, other medical supplies, beds and blankets needed to treat the many injured people still being pulled from the rubble.. \"No hospital has the capacity to accommodate this large number of injuries,\" he warned. \"[Everywhere] is full.\" . The chairman of the Sams Foundation, Dr Basel Termanini, said the lack of shelter and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services was also a major concern for the medical relief organisation, whose facilities in the region have helped more than 2,000 earthquake victims.. \"We can treat the women after trauma or after delivery, but they need to go back to a safe environment with minimum housing, nutrition and clean water,\" he told the BBC.. \"Unfortunately, this is in general lacking in north-western Syria, due to limited resources and the markedly delayed aid coming from the only lifeline of Bab al-Hawa crossing.\". Dr Termanini accused the UN and the international community of being \"quite guilty of poor planning and failed execution\". . Sams was currently working with the White Helmets and the Syrian Forum, a consortium of non-profit organisations assisting people in the region, to \"fill in the gaps\" in shelter and nutrition, he added.. \"But the needs are massive and the international community need to get their act together to avoid a major humanitarian crisis.\". More than 35,000 people are known to have been killed in Syria and Turkey since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey..  - more than 800 higher than the combined death tolls published over the weekend by the Syrian government and the White Helmets. . During a visit to the government-held city of Aleppo on Monday, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told reporters that the initial \"rescue phase\" following the disaster was \"drawing to a close\".. \"The humanitarian phase - the urgency of providing shelter, psychosocial care, food, schooling and a sense of the future for these people - that's our obligation now,\" he said.. Mr Griffiths also said the UN hoped to deliver aid to opposition-held areas across the front lines from the government's territory, something which has rarely happened during the country's 12-year civil war.. The UN has said the dominant jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has held up \"cross-line\" deliveries since the earthquake. But HTS has rejected the allegation and accused the UN of \"politicising the emergency response\".. ",

        "content": "If passed, they would curb the Supreme Court's power and give the government more say over judicial appointments.. Critics say it will undermine democracy; the government argues the reforms will strengthen it.. \"I feel very distressed, very nervous, I have a lot of sleepless nights,\" said Helit from Ness Tziona, south of Tel Aviv, who came with her daughter. . \"I think they will change. I hope so... but I think [it will be] only for a while. Then things will change again for the worse.\". Dore, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, was one of thousands whose offices shut to enable staff to attend the protests.. \"I'm here because my heart has been torn to pieces seeing what the new government is doing to Israeli democracy,\" he said.. \"You know they are tearing apart the spirit of this country. And they are threatening the power of the legal systems. I cannot see it happening without protesting against it.\" . In an unusual step, US President Joe Biden appeared to criticise the proposals in their current form .  - a rarity for a US leader to express an opinion on constitutional matters in Israel.. Israel's own President, Isaac Herzog, warned that the country was on the verge of constitutional and social collapse. Involvement by Israeli presidents in political issues are also rare since the post is considered to be a politically neutral figurehead.. Monday's demonstrations are the latest in weekly mass protests against the reforms. Opponents say the plans will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the current system where laws passed by an elected parliament can be overturned by the Supreme Court is undemocratic.. Among the planned reforms, the ability of the Supreme Court to strike down laws would be severely weakened. A simple majority in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) would also have the power to override court rulings. . The reforms would also give the government more influence over the committee which appoints judges, including to the Supreme Court.. Israel's Justice Minister Yariv Lavin, who introduced the plans, accused opponents - including the attorney general and Supreme Court's chief justice - of seeking to \"carry out a coup\" against Mr Netanyahu, after a petition was filed to the court to declare the prime minister unfit for office..

        "content": "President Sandu said the \"plot\" would involve \"protests by the so-called opposition\", aiming to \"overthrow the constitutional order\".. Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain.. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. . Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. . Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use \"saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages\".. The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.. She urged Moldova's parliament to adopt laws to give the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors \"the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats\". She added that \"the Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will fail\".. This video can not be played. Maia Sandu: \"We have the right to choose what we want for our country\" (2020 interview). Moldova's main Socialist and Communist opposition bloc has strong links with Moscow. President Sandu's predecessor Igor Dodon - who ruled from 2016 to 2020 - pursued close ties with Russia.. But since the USSR's collapse in 1991, Moldova has forged a deeper partnership with Romania, an EU member.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, former Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\"..
