        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. . However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's Chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Moscow has accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. . The French President, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday echoed this sentiment - saying that while \"nothing is excluded\" when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",

        "subtitle": "",
        "content": "On Tuesday, the Canadian-born platinum blonde will tell that story herself, in both a memoir and a nearly two-hour Netflix documentary. . Anderson, 55, reportedly began working on the projects years ago, when she first learned about the Hulu series Pam & Tommy.. \"I blocked that stolen tape out of my life to survive. And now that it's coming up again, I feel sick,\" she says in the documentary trailer. \"I want to take control of the narrative for the first time.\". Here's a look inside Anderson's new book Love, Pamela (written without the help of a ghost-writer), a close-up of one of the most recognised women in the world. . Anderson was born in Ladysmith, a small town in British Columbia's Vancouver Island on Canada's western edge. . She described her childhood within the island's forested expanse, making dirt-pies and chasing garter snakes next to \"fragrant purple lilacs, sour grapes in vines strangling the trunks of tart green apple trees\". . But these idyllic scenes are cut with the loud and sometimes violent conflict between her young parents. Anderson has previously said how her father, an alcoholic, was physically abusive to her mother.. And Anderson, too, suffered harrowing abuse, recounting three separate instances of sexual violence, all before she turned 18.. In one, Anderson says she was molested by a female baby-sitter between the ages of six and 10. \"My parents thought she was generous and kind, when really, it was just a way to get them off the scent,\" she writes. \"At the time I couldn't understand any of it. She threatened me and told me not to tell anyone. Or else.\". Then, when she was just 12, a 25-year-old acquaintance raped her. Later, at 14, a high school boyfriend and a group of his friends sexually assaulted her. \"I didn't tell anybody,\" she writes. \"I just blocked it out.\". Anderson was 22 years old and working at a tanning salon when she was discovered.. Sitting with a friend at a BC Lions football game, Anderson was picked up by a roaming stadium camera, her image projected on the Jumbotron while wearing a T-shirt with the logo for LaBatt, a Canadian beer company. LaBatt took notice - quickly hiring Anderson as a spokeswoman, plastering her face on posters and in commercials. . Playboy soon followed, summoning her to Los Angeles for a photoshoot. Promoting her book this year, Anderson told the Sunday Times that she got the call from Playboy the same day she found out her fiancé was cheating on her. . \"Doing that first photoshoot gave me this little kind of portal on what it felt like to be a sensual woman,\" Anderson said. \"My sexuality was mine. I took my power back.\". The Baywatch star would go on to pose for 14 Playboy covers - more than anyone else in the magazine's history. She has said that Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was the only person who treated her with total respect. . \"As I matured, I noticed most of my boyfriends were bad - and progressively got worse,\" Anderson writes. . Early boyfriends were macho and volatile, perhaps modelled after her father. But none of them seemed to deter her desire for romance. . Anderson has been married six times to five different men. Most famous, perhaps, is the first: Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. After a four-day courtship in February 1995, the two wed on a beach in Cancún, Mexico - Anderson in a string bikini.. But what began as a dream-like fantasy came crashing down, three years and two children later. The violent end was precipitated, Anderson says, by the sale and distribution of footage of her and Lee having sex, footage that was stolen from a safe in their Malibu, California, home. . \"It ruined lives, starting with our relationship - and it's unforgivable that people, still to this day, think they can profit from such a terrible experience,\" Anderson writes, saying the sex tape theft and ensuing scandal was \"one of the most difficult things I have gone through\". . Lee later served six months behind bars for kicking Anderson as she held their seven-week-old son, Dylan - violence that pushed her to file for divorce. The two have reconciled several times since. Anderson describes her relationship with Lee as maybe \"the only time I was ever in love\".. Anderson, who lives with three dogs in her late grandmother's home in Ladysmith, is a long-time vegan, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) spokeswoman, animal rights activist and campaigner for environmental protections. . That activism has led to some strange, high-profile encounters, including with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom she met while on a trip to the Kremlin for Peta. . \"Putin was only in the room once, but he heard of everything. I would get messages from other people that he was pleased that I was there - he kind of got a kick out of me,\" . . . Anderson's advocacy also led to a friendship with Julian Assange, a friendship that included several visits to see the Wikileaks founder in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought asylum.. The relationship was platonic, she said. \"We would just talk through the night and drink mezcal and laugh and tell stories.\". This video can not be played.

        "content": "Watch: Ahmed Shihab El-Din meets a member of the LGBT community who has been targeted. Having grown up in Egypt, I am aware of the pervasive homophobia that permeates every part of its society. But friends there tell me that the atmosphere has recently become far more brutal, and the tactics for tracking down LGBT people more sophisticated. . There is no explicit law against homosexuality in Egypt, but our investigation has found that the crime of \"debauchery\" - a sex work law - is being used to criminalise the LGBT community.. Transcripts submitted in police arrest reports show how officers are posing online to seek out - and in some cases allegedly fabricate evidence against - LGBT people looking for dates online.. They reveal how the police initiate text conversations with their targets. . Egypt is one of the most strategically important Western allies in the Middle East and receives billions of dollars in US and EU support every year. Around half a million British tourists visit the country annually and the UK trains Egyptian police forces, via the UN. . In one text conversation between an undercover police officer and someone using the social networking and dating app WhosHere, the officer appears to be pressuring the app user to meet up in person - that person was later arrested. . There are more examples which are too explicit to publish.. It is extremely difficult for LGBT people to openly meet potential dates in public in Egypt, so dating apps are a popular way to do that. But just using the apps - regardless of your sexuality - can be grounds for arrest based on the incitement of debauchery or public morality laws in Egypt.. It is not just Egyptians who are being targeted. In one transcript, police describe identifying a foreigner, who we are calling Matt, on the popular gay dating app Grindr. A police informant then engaged Matt in conversation, and - the transcript says - Matt \"admitted his perversion, his willingness to engage in debauchery for free, and sent pictures of himself and his body\".. Matt told the BBC that he was subsequently arrested, charged with \"debauchery\", and eventually deported. . LGBTQ people hunted by gangs and police in Egypt.. In some of the transcripts, the police appear to be trying to pressure people who seem to be simply seeking dates or new friendships into agreeing to sex for money. Legal experts in Egypt tell us that proving there has been an exchange of money, or an offer of one, can give the authorities the ammunition they need to take a case to court.  . One such victim, whom we found through the transcripts, was a gay man we are calling Laith. In April 2018, the contemporary dancer was contacted from a friend's phone number.. \"Hello, how are you?\" the message said. The \"friend\" asked to meet for a drink. . But when Laith arrived to meet him, his friend was nowhere in sight. He was met instead by police who arrested him and threw him into a cell belonging to the vice squad. . One policeman stubbed a cigarette out on his arm, he told me, showing me the scar.. \"It was the only time in my life that I tried to kill myself,\" Laith says.. He claims police then made a fake profile for him on the WhosHere app, and digitally altered his photos to make them look explicit. He says they then mocked up a conversation on the app which appeared to show him offering sex work.. He says the pictures are proof that he was framed, because the legs in the picture do not resemble his own - one of his legs is bigger than the other. The BBC has only had access to grainy photocopied police case files, so it cannot independently verify this detail. . Three other people told us the police forced or falsified confessions related to their cases, too.. Laith was jailed for three months for \"habitual debauchery\", reduced to a month on appeal. Laith says the police also tried to get him to inform on other gay people he knew of.. \"[The policeman] said: 'I can fabricate a whole story about you if you don't give me names.'\" . The Egyptian government has spoken publicly about its use of online surveillance to target what it described as \"homosexual gatherings\".. In 2020, Ahmed Taher, former assistant to the Minister of Interior for Internet Crimes and Human Trafficking, told the newspaper Ahl Masr: \"We recruited police in the virtual world to uncover the masses of group sex parties, homosexual gatherings.\" . The UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC that no UK funding has gone towards training for the Egyptian police in activities relevant to the claims made in the investigation.. UK MP Alicia Kearns, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC that she wanted more to be done to warn LGBT travellers about the risks in countries such as Egypt, \"where their sexuality might be weaponised against them\".. \"I would urge the Egyptian government to cease all activities which target individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation.\". The Egyptian government did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.. The WhosHere app was referenced in nearly every police transcript the BBC has had access to. . Cyber privacy experts told us that WhosHere seems to have specific vulnerabilities, allowing hackers to scrape information about its users - such as location - on a large scale. . And they say the way WhosHere is collecting and storing data is likely in breach of privacy laws in the UK and the EU.. It was only after the BBC formally approached WhosHere that the app changed its settings, removing the \"seeking same sex\" selection, which could put people at risk of identification.. WhosHere disputes the BBC's findings about vulnerabilities and say that they have a robust history of addressing problems when raised. And that they do not operate any specific service for the LGBT community in Egypt. . Grindr, also used as an app by police and criminals to find LGBT people in Egypt said: \"We work extensively with Egyptian LGBTQ activists, international human rights advocates, and safety-focused technologists to best serve our users in the region.\" . Criminal gangs are using the same tactics as the police to find LGBT people. They then attack and humiliate them, and extort them by threatening to post the videos online.. For the BBC documentary Queer Egypt Under Attack we used innovative face-tracking 3-D masking to ensure identities remained protected - the aim was to give the film a more attractive aesthetic than the usual blobbing technique of disguise allows.  . I managed to track down two people we are calling Laila and Jamal, who were victims of a video that went viral in Egypt a few years ago. The footage shows them being forced to strip and dance, while being beaten and abused. They are forced at knife point to give their full names and admit they are gay. They told me the duo behind the video - named Bakar and Yehia - are notorious amongst the community. . We saw at least four videos in which Bakar and Yehia either appeared, or could be heard, extorting and abusing LGBT people before they uploaded the videos to Whatsapp, Youtube and Facebook. In one of these videos, an 18-year-old gay man we are calling Saeed is forced to, falsely, say he is a sex worker. I met him to hear about what happened next. He told me that he considered legal action but says his lawyer advised against this, telling him his sexuality would be perceived as more of a crime than the attack he suffered.. Saeed is now alienated from his family. He says they cut him off when the gang sent them the video in a bid to blackmail them too.. \"I have been suffering from depression after what happened, with the videos circulating to all my friends in Egypt. I don't go out, and I don't have a phone.. \"No-one used to know anything about me.\". We've been told about dozens of attacks like this - carried out by multiple gangs. There are only a few reports of attackers being arrested. . It shocked me to learn, in the course of investigation that one gang leader, Yahia, is gay and actively posting online about his own sex work.. But perhaps it gives him a criminal edge - he knows just how vulnerable his targets are. And arguably his own position, as a gay man with little opportunity, fuels his criminality. . We have no evidence that Yahia has been involved in recent attacks, and he has denied  involvement in any of the attacks.. Covering any of these issues inside Egypt itself has been banned since 2017, when the country's Supreme Council for Media Regulation imposed a media blackout on LGBT representation except if the coverage \"acknowledge[s] the fact that their conduct is inappropriate\".. LGBT community advocates, many of them in exile, are divided over whether the problems in Egypt should be highlighted in the media or tackled behind the scenes.. But Laila, Saeed, Jamal and Laith have chosen to step out of the shadows and break the silence. . ",

        "content": "Canada's federal government granted the request by the west coast province to try out the three-year experiment. . It follows a similar policy in the nearby US state of Oregon, which decriminalised hard drugs in 2020. . Ahead of the pilot's launch, British Columbia and federal officials outlined the rules under the federally approved exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.. While those substances will remain illegal, adults found in possession of a combined total of less than 2.5g of the drugs will not be arrested, charged or have their substances seized. Instead, they will be offered information on available health and social services.. Federal minister of mental health and addictions Carolyn Bennett on Monday called the move \"a monumental shift in drug policy that favours fostering trusting and supportive relationships in health and social services over further criminalisation\".. Some 10,000 residents have died from drug overdoses since British Columbia declared drugs to be a public health emergency in 2016, officials said. . This video can not be played. Vancouver's unusual approach offers opioid users injection sites, antidotes and even heroin on prescription.. \"Decriminalising people who use drugs breaks down the fear and shame associated with substance use and ensures they feel safer reaching out for life-saving supports,\" said Jennifer Whiteside, the British Columbia minister for mental health and addictions.. Thousands of police officers in the province have been offered training on the rule change, including those in Vancouver, the largest city in the province. . The programme will run from 31 January 2023 until 31 January 2026, unless it is revoked by the federal government.. Some experts have questioned the 2.5g limit, saying that it is not enough to account for the habits of many addicts. . There are some exemptions to the scheme.. The sale of drugs remains illegal. It is also illegal to possess drugs on the grounds of schools, childcare facilities and airports.. Canada legalised the use of recreational cannabis for adults nationwide in 2018.. But the four drugs now allowed in small quantities remain prohibited, meaning there are no plans to sell them in stores, unlike marijuana. Trafficking them across borders also remains illegal. . ",
