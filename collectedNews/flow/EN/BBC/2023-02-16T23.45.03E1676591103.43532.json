        "content": "Watch: Zelensky says peace deal would 'leave Ukraine weaker as a state'. In a BBC interview to mark a year since Russia's full-scale invasion, he warned conceding land would mean Russia could \"keep coming back\", while Western weapons would bring peace closer. . Mr Zelensky also said a predicted spring offensive had already begun.. \"Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,\" he said. . He does, however, believe Ukraine's forces can keep resisting Russia's advance until they are able to launch a counter-offensive - although he repeated his calls for more military aid from the West.. \"Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands,\" Mr Zelensky told the BBC.. He met UK and EU leaders last week in a bid to bolster international support and to ask for modern arms to defend his country. When Ukraine's president asked for modern fighter jets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing is off the table\".. But Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated with the speed with which Western weapons have arrived. Deliveries of battle tanks - . , including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. President Zelensky also addressed .  to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a single Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. . \"I hope [Belarus] won't join [the war],\" he said. \"If it does, we will fight and we will survive.\" Allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack again would be a \"huge mistake\", he added.. This video can not be played. Watch: Zelensky warns Belarus against helping Russian offensive. Russian forces launched part of their full-scale invasion from Belarus 12 months ago. They drove south towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv but were fought back and made to retreat within weeks, after suffering heavy casualties.. When asked if he was surprised by Russia's tactics in the war, Mr Zelensky described them as \"valueless\".. \"The way they destroyed everything. If their soldiers received [and carried out] those orders, that means they share those same values.\".  suggested Russian troops in Ukraine were dying in greater numbers this month than at any time since the first week of their invasion. The figures cannot be verified, but the UK's Ministry of Defence said the trends were \"likely accurate\".. \"Today, our survival is our unity,\" said Mr Zelensky on how he thought the war will end. \"I believe Ukraine is fighting for its survival.\" His country was moving towards Europe economically, as well as through its values, he said.. \"We chose this path. We want security guarantees. Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state.\". \"It's not about compromise itself,\" he said. \"Why would we be afraid of that? We have millions of compromises in life every day.. \"The question is with whom? With Putin? No. Because there's no trust. Dialogue with him? No. Because there's no trust.\". ",

But today in Minsk, Mr Lukashenko took questions from a small group of foreign media, including the BBC.. \"Last year you allowed your country to be used as a staging ground for Russia's invasion,\" I reminded Mr Lukashenko. \"Are you prepared to do so again?\" . \"Yes, I'm ready,\" he replied. \"I'm ready to provide [territory] again. I'm also ready to wage war, alongside the Russians, from the territory of Belarus. But only if someone - even a single soldier - enters our territory from there (Ukraine) with weapons to kill my people.\". Military co-operation between Russia and Belarus has been on the increase, with joint drills and the formation of a joint military grouping.

The UK, EU and the United States do not recognise Alexander Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus. In 2020 Belarusians .  of stealing the country's presidential election. The protests were brutally suppressed.. Mr Lukashenko used Thursday's event to blame the West for the war in Ukraine. . He accused Western governments of fuelling the conflict and engaged in a touch of Putinesque nuclear sabre-rattling,. \"If you continue this escalation, you will get nuclear weapons and Russia has more than anyone,\" he said.. \"So, you should stop this. If a nuclear war starts, Belarus will cease to exist. We need to sit down at the negotiating table, because nuclear war will wipe out the USA too. No-one needs this.\". Having facilitated the Russian invasion of Ukraine one year ago, the Belarusian leader now claims he can help negotiate peace. . Mr Lukashenko suggested that next week would be a good time to start, with US President Joe Biden due to visit Poland.. \"I invite [President Biden] to Belarus,\" Mr Lukashenko said. \"It's not far from Warsaw, Thirty minutes and he'll be in Minsk. He could land his plane here. I will persuade the president of Russia to come. I invite him too to Minsk, as well as Biden. We will sit down and reach an agreement.\" . It is an invitation the US president is likely to decline. In this war Mr Lukashenko is not seen as an honest broker.. ",
