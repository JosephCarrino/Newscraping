        "content": "Watch: \"I apologise to the whole Ukrainian nation\" - former Russian army officer. Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector.. At one site in southern Ukraine, he said \"the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week\". . \"Every day, at night, sometimes twice a day.\". Mr Yefremov tried to resign from the army numerous times - but he ended up being dismissed for refusing to return to Ukraine. He has now fled Russia.. Using photographs and military documents supplied by Mr Yefremov, the BBC has verified he was in Ukraine early in the war - in the Zaporizhzhia region, including the city of Melitopol.. Konstantin Yefremov's face flickers into view on my computer screen and we start to talk. He is a man with a story to tell. Until recently he was a Russian army officer. . Deployed to Ukraine last year, the former senior lieutenant has agreed to tell me about the crimes he says he witnessed there - including torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He will talk about his comrades looting occupied areas of Ukraine, and describe brutal interrogation sessions, led by a Russian colonel, in which men were shot and threatened with rape.. On 10 February 2022, Mr Yefremov says he arrived in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia nine years ago. He was the head of a de-mining unit of the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division - and was usually based in Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus. He and his men were sent to take part in \"military exercises\", he says. . \"At the time no-one believed there would be war. Everyone thought this was only a drill. I'm sure even senior officers didn't know.\". Mr Yefremov recalls seeing Russian troops taping identification marks on their uniforms and painting the letter \"Z\" on military equipment and vehicles. Within days, \"Z\" had become the symbol of what the Kremlin was calling its \"special military operation\". . Mr Yefremov claims he wanted nothing to do with it.   . \"I decided to quit. I went to my commander and explained my position. He took me to a senior officer who called me a traitor and a coward.. \"I left my gun, got in a taxi and drove off. I wanted to return to my base in Chechnya and resign officially. Then my comrades telephoned me with a warning. . \"A colonel had promised to put me in prison for up to 10 years for desertion and he'd alerted the police.\". Mr Yefremov says he called a military lawyer, who advised him to turn around. . \"I realise now I should have ignored that and driven on,\" he says. \"But I was afraid of being put in jail.\" . He went back to join his men.. Mr Yefremov insists he is \"anti-war\". He assures me he did not participate in Russia's annexation of Crimea, or fight in eastern Ukraine when war first erupted in the Donbas nine years ago. . In 2014, Russia was not only accused of orchestrating a separatist uprising there, but of sending in its own troops. Konstantin also tells me he has not taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria. . \"For the last three years I had been involved in mine clearance in Chechnya, a place that had experienced two wars. I think the work I've done there has benefited people.\". Mr Yefremov was placed in temporary charge of a rifle platoon. On 27 February, three days after the Russian invasion, he says he and his men were ordered to move north from occupied Crimea. They headed for the city of Melitopol.. The next 10 days were spent at an airfield which had already been captured by Russian troops. He describes the looting he witnessed.. \"Soldiers and officers grabbed everything they could. They climbed all over the planes and went through all the buildings. One soldier took away a lawnmower. He said proudly, 'I'll take this home and cut the grass next to our barracks.' . \"Buckets, axes, bicycles, they bunged it all in their trucks. So much stuff they had to squat down to fit in the vehicles.\". Mr Yefremov has sent us photographs he says he took at Melitopol air base. They show transport planes and a building on fire. . They are among a number of pictures and documents he has shared - and which we have verified - to confirm Mr Yefremov's identity, rank and his movements in Ukraine in the spring of 2022. . Online mapping tools confirmed the images of Melitopol air base.. For a month and a half, he and eight soldiers under his command guarded a Russian artillery unit there.. \"The whole time we slept outside,\" he recalls. \"We were so hungry we started hunting for rabbits and pheasants. One time we came across a mansion. There was a Russian fighter inside. 'We're with the 100th Brigade and we live here now,' the soldier said. . \"There was so much food. The fridges were packed. There was enough food to survive a nuclear war. But the soldiers living there were catching the Japanese carp in the pond outside and eating them.\". Konstantin Yefremov's group moved to guard what he describes as a \"logistics headquarters\" in April - in the town of Bilmak, to the north-east of Melitopol. There, he says he witnessed interrogations and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners.. He recalls a day when three prisoners were brought in.. \"One of them admitted to being a sniper. On hearing this, the Russian colonel lost his mind. He hit him, he pulled the Ukrainian's trousers down and asked if he was married. . \"'Yes,' the prisoner replied. 'Then someone bring me a mop,' said the colonel. 'We'll turn you into a girl and send your wife the video.'\". Another time, says Mr Yefremov, the colonel asked the prisoner to name all the Ukrainian nationalists in his unit.. \"The Ukrainian didn't understand the question. He replied that the soldiers were naval infantry of the Ukrainian armed forces. For that answer they knocked out some of his teeth.\". The Kremlin wants Russians to believe that, in Ukraine, Russia is fighting fascists, neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. This false narrative serves to dehumanise Ukrainians in the eyes of the Russian public and the military.. Mr Yefremov says the Ukrainian prisoner had a blindfold on. . \"The colonel put a pistol to the prisoner's forehead and said 'I'm going to count to three and then shoot you in the head.' . \"He counted and then fired just to the side of his head, on both sides. The colonel started shouting at him. I said: 'Comrade colonel! He can't hear you, you've deafened him!'\". Mr Yefremov describes how the colonel gave orders that the Ukrainians shouldn't be given normal food - only water and crackers. But he says: \"We tried to give them hot tea and cigarettes.\" . So that the prisoners didn't sleep on bare ground, Mr Yefremov also recalls how his men tossed them hay - \"at night, so that no-one saw us\". . During another interrogation, Mr Yefremov says the colonel shot a prisoner in the arm - and in the right leg under the knee, which hit the bone. Konstantin says his men bandaged the prisoner up and went to the Russian commanders - \"not to the Colonel, he was crazy\" - and said the prisoner needed to go to hospital, otherwise he would die from blood loss.. \"We dressed him up in a Russian uniform and took him to hospital. We told him: 'Don't say you're a Ukrainian prisoner of war, because either the doctors will refuse to treat you, or the injured Russian soldiers will hear and shoot you and we won't be able to stop them.\". The UN's Human Rights Office has been documenting cases of mistreatment of prisoners in the war in Ukraine. It has interviewed more than 400 POWs - both Ukrainians and Russians. . \"Unfortunately, we've found there is torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war happening on both sides,\" says Matilda Bogner, head of the UN's Ukraine-based monitoring team. . \"If we compare the violations, the torture or ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war tends to happen at almost every stage of confinement. And, for the most part, the conditions of internment are worse in many areas of Russia or occupied Ukraine.\". The worst forms of torture or ill treatment for Ukrainian prisoners of war usually occur during interrogation, says Ms Bogner. They can be subjected to electrocution and a whole range of torture methods - she says - including hanging people up and beating them. . \"When they arrive at places of internment there are often so-called welcoming beatings. They also often face inadequate food and water,\" she adds.. Russian prisoners of war, too, have reported beatings and suffering electrocution.. \"Any form of torture or ill treatment is prohibited under international law,\" says Ms Bogner. \"It is unacceptable for either side to do this.\". The BBC was unable to independently confirm Konstantin Yefremov's specific allegations of torture, but they are consistent with other claims of abuse of Ukrainian prisoners.. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.. Mr Yefremov would eventually return to his de-mining unit, but not for long.. \"Seven of us had taken the decision [to leave the army],\" he tells me.. At the end of May, back in Chechnya, he wrote his letter of resignation. Some senior officers were not happy. . \"They started threatening me. Officers who hadn't spent a day in Ukraine were telling me that I was a coward and a traitor. They wouldn't allow me to resign. I was dismissed.\". Mr Yefremov shows us letters from the military.. In the first document, he is accused of \"shirking his duties\" and disregarding an order to return to Ukraine. It is described as \"a serious breach of discipline\".. The second letter refers to Mr Yefremov's \"early dismissal from military service… for breaking his contract\".. \"After 10 years of service I was denounced as a traitor, a defector, just because I didn't want to kill people,\" he says. \"But I was glad that I was now a free person, that I wouldn't have to kill or be killed.\" . Mr Yefremov was out of the army. But not out of danger of being sent back to the war.. In September 2022, President Putin declared what he called \"partial mobilisation\". Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens would be drafted into the military and sent to Ukraine.. Mr Yefremov says he knew - because he had already served with the military in Ukraine - he would not be left alone. He came up with an escape plan.. \"In the house where I was living I made a hatch in the attic ceiling… in case police and enlistment officers broke in to deliver call-up papers. . \"Enlistment officers were driving to my house and waiting for me in their cars. So, I rented a flat and hid there. . \"I hid from the neighbours, too, because I'd heard of cases when neighbours told police about young men who'd been drafted and were hiding. I found this situation humiliating and unacceptable.\"  . Mr Yefremov contacted Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, which helped him leave Russia.  . What does Mr Yefremov think about those Russians - and there are many - who express support for Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine?. \"I don't know what's going on in their heads,\" he says. \"How could they allow themselves to be fooled? When they go to market, they know they could be short-changed. They don't trust their wives, their husbands. . \"But the man who has been deceiving them for 20 years, he only has to give the word and these people are ready to go and kill and die. I can't understand it.\". As we end our chat, Mr Yefremov says sorry to the people of Ukraine.. \"I apologise to the entire Ukrainian nation for coming to their home as an uninvited guest with a weapon in my hands.. \"Thank God I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anyone. Thank God I wasn't killed. . \"I don't even have the moral right to ask for forgiveness from the Ukrainians. I can't forgive myself, so I can't expect them to forgive me.\". ",

        "content": "The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints - Taiwan and the South China Sea.. The deal, which in part reverses the US' departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. . \"There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,\" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. . \"The US is not looking for permanent bases. It's about places, not bases.\" . The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will \"allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges\", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. . The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. . The US hasn't said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don't count China.. These days the US is seeking access to places where \"light and flexible\" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. . In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. . Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. . The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. . Roll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the Malacañang Palace. . More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it's knocking on the Philippines' front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines' own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. . Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. . \"We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.\". \"We have very limited capability against the threat from China,\" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. . He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. . \"The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.\". But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. . The history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. . \"We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,\" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. \"The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There's a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.\". The US' return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country's left-wing groups. . While there won't be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. . The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.. The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. . \"The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,\" he says. \"It's buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels.\" . With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a \"rear access area\" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. . \"People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,\" Mr Poling says. . But Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China's rise, Professor Kraft cautions. . \"The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage.\" . Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. . In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China's state-run Global Times accused the US of \"setting a trap for the Philippines\" and \"trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China\".  . \"We are once again being caught in the middle,\" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. . \"The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.\" .
