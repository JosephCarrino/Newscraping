        "content": "Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. In a week heavy with events ahead of Friday's anniversary of Russia's Ukraine invasion, Mr Putin spoke first.. The West had enabled Nazi Germany, he claimed, and had turned Ukraine into a neo-Nazi regime that was \"anti-Russia\".. Hours later Mr Biden said autocrats understood only one word: \"No, no, no!\". \"Putin thought the world would roll over, he was wrong,\" he said, vowing that Nato was more united than ever. Kyiv stood strong, proud, tall and free and Western support for Ukraine would not fail, he added. . Welcoming him to Warsaw's royal castle, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that by travelling to Kyiv Mr Biden had shown the free world did not fear anything. Nato's role was to defend and support the free world and Ukraine \"must win this war\".. Mr Putin's speech barely touched on the progress of Russia's military in Ukraine and there was no indication of how the war might end. The main news involving Russia's military came from Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who accused the chief of staff and defence minister of trying to destroy his group and starve it of weapons.. Russia's president did announce he was suspending the New Start nuclear arms control treaty signed with the US in 2010. The deal caps nuclear warhead numbers and Nato, and UK leaders have urged him to reconsider.. He also declared he had put new ground-based systems on combat duty. He had already threatened last year to use \"all means at our disposal\" to protect Russia and territory it has seized in Ukraine.. Truth was an early casualty of Mr Putin's lengthy speech, at an exhibition centre a stone's throw from the Kremlin.. \"They were the ones who started the war... we're using force to stop it,\" . . . No Western troops have been on the ground in Ukraine, but Russia's foreign ministry appeared to double down on the claim when it summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy on Tuesday, saying that Washington should take steps to withdraw \"US-Nato military and equipment\" from Ukraine.. Mr Putin has blamed the West and Nato countless times in the past, and he reprised many of his claims from his TV address on the day of the invasion a year ago. He reminded Russians of the war in Iraq and the bombing of Belgrade, but steered clear of Russia's long and devastating role in the Syrian civil war, its invasion of neighbouring Georgia or landgrab in Crimea.. As he spoke there was a deadly reminder of the human cost of Europe's most deadly invasion since World War Two.. Six people died and many more were wounded as Russian shells hit Kherson city, liberated from Russian troops last November. A bus stop, a pharmacy and residential areas were hit in the city centre and local media said a kindergarten was among the buildings that came under attack.. In his nightly address on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attacks \"did not and could not have any military purpose\", and were instead intended to sow \"terror\".. He added that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the front line in eastern Ukraine - where the bulk of the current fighting is taking place - despite facing great pressure. . Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.. The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.. Each side's limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.. Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world's nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.. President Biden visited Warsaw a day after he had gone to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky, in a highly complex security operation. . The Polish president said the visit had sent \"an extremely important political signal, primarily for Ukraine\", but it was also a sign that the free world and the president of the US was with them and did not forget.. Mr Biden reserved much of his praise for Mr Zelensky and the Ukrainians who had reclaimed land captured during the first weeks of the war.. But he also had words of support for Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, over allegations that Russia was plotting to overthrow the current government. . President Putin on Tuesday stoked tensions in Moldova by cancelling a 2012 decree that backed Moldova's sovereignty in solving the future of a breakaway region of Moldova called Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.. President Biden is due to meet leaders of nine countries on Nato's eastern flank on Wednesday, and he went out of his way to reaffirm American backing for one of the alliance's key pledges.. Under its Article 5, members of Nato pledge to defend any other member that comes under attack. Mr Biden said US commitment both to the alliance and Article 5 was  \"rock solid\".. \"Every member of Nato knows it and Russia knows it as well - an attack against one is an attack against all.\". Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, followed up Mr Biden's visit to Kyiv on Tuesday with her first trip to Ukraine. Visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, where Russian troops murdered hundreds of civilians, she said Ukrainians could count on Italy: \"We have been with you since the start and we will be until the end.\".

        "content": "We've looked into some of his statements. . Mr Putin has repeatedly made baseless claims about a \"neo-Nazi regime\" in Ukraine as a justification for Russia's invasion of the country. . In Ukraine's last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, far lower than in many other European countries.. It should also be noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust.. But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine - the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.. This video can not be played. From 2022: Ros Atkins on... Putinâ€™s false Nazi claims about Ukraine. It was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military.. Here, Mr Putin drew a comparison between a Ukrainian army unit and the Nazis' 1st Mountain Division - which had the Edelweiss flower on its insignia and committed war crimes in the Second World War. . On 14 February, President Zelensky .  the .  the honorary title: Edelweiss. . The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this as \"evidence\" of Nazis in Ukraine in a tweet. . But the Edelweiss flower - which grows in Alpine regions - has been used as a symbol by other European mountain military divisions, including the . , Swiss Army generals and the 21st Rifles Brigade of Poland. . Even Russia had a special unit called Edelweiss. The 17th special purpose detachment of Rosgvardia was given this title in 2011. The name was changed to .  in 2016.. There is no evidence that Ukraine has attempted to acquire nuclear weapons, and Mr Putin - who has made this claim before - did not provide any. . When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine, but in 1994 Ukraine signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them up, in return for security guarantees. . In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested that if Ukraine couldn't join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status.. In 2022, .  that although Ukraine had \"abandoned\" its nuclear capabilities, it had \"no security\". . But the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them.. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine \"of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.\". Mr Putin is right that the Russian economy has shrunk by less than expected. . Russia's statistics agency says the economy measured by GDP . , which is close to the 2.2% estimate in the . .. That contraction still makes it the worst-performing country on the IMF's list, but the organisation confirms that it has contracted by less than expected.. The IMF said that Russian trade was being redirected to countries not applying sanctions against it.. India and China . , for example, as Western nations restrict purchases and impose sanctions..

        "content": "GarcÃ­a Luna - who was arrested in the state of Texas in 2019 - had pleaded not guilty. . The 54-year-old could face life in prison. . At a minimum, GarcÃ­a Luna will serve the mandatory minimum of 20 years, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. . The verdict came after a four-week trial and three days of jury deliberation in the US District Court in Brooklyn, New York. . Prosecutors said the former head of the Mexican equivalent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigations accepted millions of dollars stuffed in briefcases and delivered by members of JoaquÃ­n \"El Chapo\" GuzmÃ¡n's Sinaloa drug cartel.. GarcÃ­a Luna, who moved to the US after leaving office, is the highest-ranking Mexican official ever to be tried in the US. . On Twitter, a spokesperson for current Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Cuevas, praised the decision and took aim at former Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n. . GarcÃ­a Luna served under Mr CalderÃ³n, who oversaw a crackdown on drug cartels beginning in 2006. . \"Justice has arrived for the former squire of Felipe CalderÃ³n,\" Mr Ramirez Cuevas wrote. \"The crimes against our people will never be forgotten.\". Ioan Grillo, a Mexico-based British author and expert on Mexico's criminal underworld, told BBC News the conviction has \"big implications\" for both the US and Mexico governments' fight against corruption and organised crime. . \"This could encourage prosecutors to go after other cases,\" he said. \"They took a certain risk by not having physical evidence and convicting him on testimony from drug traffickers.\" . He added GarcÃ­a Luna's conviction could also help dissuade Mexican officials from being \"openly corrupt\". . \"If you're a Mexican agent, you'll be thinking about how much you expose yourself to the Americans,\" he said.. The ex-minister - widely considered the architect of Mexico's war on drugs - was said to have shared information with the Sinaloa drug cartel about its rivals and warned the group about law enforcement operations.. GarcÃ­a Luna denied the allegations. . The claims against GarcÃ­a Luna's involvement with the Sinaloa cartel first came to light during a trial against GuzmÃ¡n, who was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years in 2019. . A former cartel member named Jesus \"Rey\" Zambada testified during GuzmÃ¡n's trial that he had delivered millions of dollars in payments to GarcÃ­a Luna.. The case against the former minister was built on the testimony of nine cooperating witnesses, mostly convicted cartel members, including Zambada. . GarcÃ­a Luna declined to testify at the trial, but his wife, Linda Cristina Pereyra, took the stand and attempted to downplay their finances and lifestyle. . In her closing argument, US prosecutor Saritha Komatireddy said the Sinaloa cartel could not have built a \"global cocaine empire\" without GarcÃ­a Luna's aid.. \"They paid the defendant bribes for protection,\" she said. \"And they got what they paid for.\". GarcÃ­a Luna's lawyers argued the witnesses were testifying against him to \"save themselves\" after committing \"horrific crimes\". . Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official, said the conviction would come as no surprise to those closely following the trial in Mexico. . \"It was certainly enough to convince the jury, although many others will be unconvinced,\" he told BBC News. . The conviction could \"complicate some parts\" of US-Mexico cooperation, he said. . \"There won't be any sort of rupture or open dispute,\" he added. \"But ... it will be known that the US has its eyes on Mexican officials. For some, that will make things difficult.\" . ",
