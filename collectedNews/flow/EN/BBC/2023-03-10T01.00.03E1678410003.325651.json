        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. . \"Today's loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,\" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).. Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Mr Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "A much-anticipated wave of strikes to mark the first anniversary of Russia's full scale invasion on 24 February failed to materialise - though this probably said more about media expectations than Russia's actual strategy. . But the increasingly sporadic nature of Russia's infrastructure attacks is notable.. Western officials believe this indicates a shortage of the kind of precision-guided weaponry - especially missiles - needed to carry out such attacks with any measure of effectiveness. . \"It takes them that long to get a number of precision weapons together before they can mount a packaged event strike,\" was how one official put it earlier this week. . Ukraine's military has also become quite adept at intercepting incoming missiles and drones.. Preliminary data suggests that a significant proportion of the weapons used today were shot down, including more than 70% of the cruise missiles and half the drones. . According to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, another eight missiles were thwarted by what he described as \"organized countermeasures\".. But clearly, judging by reports from all over the country, others found their mark. . Some weapons, like the long range Kh-22 anti-ship missile, which dives steeply onto its target from an extremely high altitude, are hard to intercept. . The same goes for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile, which was never designed to attack targets on the ground but which has been increasingly used in this role over the course of the past six months. . Military analysts will pore over the latest data, looking for what Russia's choice of weapons indicates about Moscow's tactics and remaining stocks. . Before today's attacks, observers had begun to wonder whether Russia would persist with a strategy that doesn't appear to be working.. Despite the enormous damage inflicted on Ukraine's power grid over the past six months, the country has not been brought to its knees and most Ukrainians have long since become accustomed to power cuts, inconvenience and the occasional danger.  . Ukraine's engineers have successfully kept power flowing across the country, despite losing scores of transformers, switches and other key components of the country's infrastructure.. In Kyiv and other cities, street lights have recently been switched back on, offering relief to pedestrians used to making their way along darkened pavements with only their mobile phones to light the way.. But the situation remains precarious and officials know that Russia is still able to cause immense damage. The question is: For how long?. This video can not be played.
