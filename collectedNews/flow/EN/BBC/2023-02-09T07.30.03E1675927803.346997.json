The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu disagreed.. \"If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan,\" he said.. The president rejected the accusation and said unity was required in the aftermath of the disaster, \"In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,\" he told reporters in Hatay.. Thousands of survivors have been spending a third night in freezing conditions, with hope fading for many trapped under the rubble.. A World Health Organization official has warned there could be significant injuries caused by freezing temperatures among survivors of the quakes. . This video can not be played. Syria earthquake: Crowds chant ‘God is great’ as family pulled alive from rubble. \"We've got a lot of people who have survived now out in the open, in worsening and horrific conditions,\" said WHO earthquake response incident manager Robert Holden on Wednesday.. \"We are in real danger of seeing a secondary disaster which may cause harm to more people than the initial disaster if we don't move with the same pace and intensity as we are doing on the search and rescue.\" . In nearby Syria, relief efforts have been complicated by years of conflict that has destroyed the nation's infrastructure.. The Bab al-Hawa crossing between Turkey and Syria has been closed since the earthquake as the roads were badly damaged.. While a senior UN official said the road may soon be accessible, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the country was working to open two more border gates to help get aid into the country.. \"There are some difficulties in terms of Turkey's and the international community's aid [reaching Syria]. For this reason, efforts are being made to open two more border gates,\" he said.. The EU has confirmed it will send €3.5m (£3.1m) in aid to Syria following a government request for assistance, but said the aid must be delivered to both government- and rebel-controlled areas.. More than 1,500 people have died in Idlib province alone and an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said sanctions were stopping Syria from receiving the aid it needed.. \"We don't have enough bulldozers, we do not have enough cranes, we do not have enough oil due to European and American sanctions,\" Bouthaina Shabban said. .

Onlookers including family, friends and neighbours of the building's residents stopped talking, while cranes and other machinery nearby were switched off.. After minutes of silence, rescuers called out for an ambulance, confirming that a woman had been found alive. . The crowd broke into cheers and tears. . One woman, whose cousin and aunt lived in the building and are still missing, fell back onto a car bonnet and buried her face in her hands.. Onlookers told the BBC it marked the first time a survivor had been found at the six-storey apartment block since Monday's earthquake reduced it to rubble.. Shortly before they were found, a body had been pulled from the debris just a few metres away.. Rescue workers and volunteers quickly formed a chain to carry the woman to a waiting ambulance.. Local residents said she was a single mother in her 50s who lived alone in the building. Her son stood by the ambulance and watched as she was carried down, they added. . Several onlookers said it gave them renewed hope that their own missing loved ones would be found. One said she was hoping for a \"miracle\".. Rescue workers hugged as the woman was taken away - a rare moment of hope and happiness among so much devastation.. The mood at the Iskenderun apartment block quickly became sombre again as rescuers resumed the slow work of searching the rubble, largely by hand.. Local doctor Mehmet Riyat told the BBC medical staff had been overwhelmed since Monday.. \"We've had patients who have been crushed. We've seen lots of broken bones, broken necks, head injuries. And lots of deaths,\" he said.. \"As doctors we have to do our jobs. But when the support teams take over, then we think about our own families.\". There is destruction everywhere you turn in Iskenderun - many buildings have been destroyed, including a busy hospital.. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit back on Wednesday at . . Critics have said emergency efforts have been too slow and that not enough was done to prepare the earthquake-prone region by his government..

        "content": "The outage-tracking website DownDetector reported the glitch at just before 22:00 GMT.. Elon Musk has slashed Twitter's workforce over the last few months since he acquired the platform last October for $44bn (£36.5bn).. Last month the Tesla and SpaceX boss said Twitter had about 2,300 employees - down from around 8,000 when he took over. . For months experts have been warning that such deep cuts could cause technical issues, though it is not yet clear if the reduced headcount was to blame for Wednesday's outage. . It appears part of the outage was soon fixed, with many users reporting they could tweet.  . Some reported being notified by Twitter that they were over the 2,400-tweet-per-day limit, even if they had not posted on Wednesday.. Account holders had also reported problems with Twitter messages. Several users said they could not access TweetDeck - a dashboard that can be used with Twitter. . It's not yet clear how many people were affected. . \"Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you. Sorry for the trouble. We're aware and working to get this fixed,\" Twitter said. . In recent weeks many users have complained of bugs while using Twitter - including some claiming they could increase the reach of tweets if they locked their accounts. . Tech news website The Information reported that Mr Musk had told Twitter employees to pause on new feature development \"in favour of maximising system stability and robustness, especially with the Super Bowl coming up\".. Twitter also announced that users of its $8 a month subscription service in the US can now post longer tweets.. Twitter Blue subscribers can now post up to 4,000 characters, far more than the 280-character limit imposed on non-paying users.. \"But don't worry, Twitter is still Twitter,\" the company said in a lengthy tweet announcing the feature.. Meanwhile, DownDetector also reported an outage at YouTube, which at its peak affected a reported 65,000 users.. In a tweet, YouTube - which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - said it was investigating reports that the website's homepage \"is down for some of you\".. \"We're looking into it... really sorry if you're experiencing this,\" they wrote. .
