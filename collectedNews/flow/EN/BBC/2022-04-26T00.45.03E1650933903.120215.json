        "content": "He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Mr Musk said . . . \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\" he added. . \"Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\". The move comes as Twitter faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation on the platform.. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year, it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". . At the time Mr Musk observed: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de factor arbiter of free speech\".. News of Mr Musk's takeover has been cheered by the right in the US, although Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform.. The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: \"No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms.\". On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chair of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an \"extraordinary development in the world of social media\". . \"It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate.\". Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself.. In 2018, US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40bn settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny.. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand \"pedo guy\" on the platform. . On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate.. \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,\" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced.. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. . Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.  . Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published.. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced. . But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm.. Mr Musk has said he doesn't \"care about the economics\" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance.. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. . The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook.. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was \"the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders\".. It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November.. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: \"I don't have confidence in management.\". Mr Agrawal on Monday said: \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\". Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted . Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. . He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. . The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. . How many miles do you need to drive before it pays off?.

Kavala denied the charges and has accused the government of \"judicial assassination\".. Western diplomats were among those attending a packed court.. Kavala was first accused of orchestrating and financing nationwide anti-government protests that erupted in 2013.. He was acquitted, but soon after he was accused of being part of the attempted coup in 2016, which saw tens of thousands of people jailed or lose their jobs.. At the trial, he was charged with both counts.. Europe's top court, the European Court of Human Rights, has said there was insufficient evidence he committed an offence, and that his arrest was an attempt to \"silence him and dissuade other human rights defenders\".. Kavala was born in Paris and educated in the UK. Before being thrust to prominence, he ran a cultural centre. . Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government has become more authoritarian in recent years, has accused Kavala of being an agent of the Hungarian-born US billionaire George Soros..

        "content": "The centrist president's victory over Marine Le Pen may have been convincing, but he has a problem. There are new elections around the corner to France's National Assembly and a big section of the electorate dislikes him.. \"There is a lot of hate,\" sociologist Michel Wieviorka told the BBC. \"He said last night 'I am happy' but I don't think he can be totally happy because there are plenty of clouds in his sky.\". Politically, if he fares badly in the June elections, he could end up losing his majority and may not be able to form his own government. That's why his opponents are calling the next vote a \"third round\".. Why would that matter if he's just won 58.5% of the national vote? . Many of his voters are not natural supporters and are unlikely to back him in June. A large number of far-left voters held their noses to keep the far right out of power, but then there are also a number of mainstream parties that threw their weight behind him too, including the Republicans, Greens and Socialists.. One opinion poll indicated that 63% of voters would rather he lost his majority and had to share power with an opposition government, known in France as \"co-habitation\".. Far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon has designs on becoming prime minister himself. If that were to happen, there would be little love lost between him and the president. He claimed that Mr Macron had won the vote with the worst result in French history. Even if he was wrong, it was still a valid point that more than a third of voters had either stayed away from the election or voted for no candidate at all.. France's election winner is therefore a man in a hurry. He wants to rush through important reforms to persuade a jaded electorate to vote for his party. . Within days, he needs to form a new government, replacing Prime Minister Jean Castex, who led France through the Covid pandemic. . Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne is seen as a popular choice, because she has a strong record on social issues and it is social reforms that are his priority right now. . Mr Macron is also believed to want a woman in the job.. And she seems to understand the need for speed - especially when it comes to the issue which dominated both rounds of the presidential election: the cost of living that is causing a headache across French society and became the focus of Marine Le Pen's campaign.. \"We need to provide quick answers,\" she told reporters.. Indeed, within hours of the election result, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised to keep in place a price cap on gas and electricity price rises until the end of 2022. . But spending is just one of four priorities Macron needs to push in the coming weeks, according to Junior Economy Minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher.  The environment, education, and health are also key, with green issues a particular priority for younger voters. . And don't forget, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds did not bother to vote on Sunday.. But the flagship reform Macron is really determined to push through is controversial: raising the pension age from 62 to 65.. However, government spokesman Gabriel Attal has promised the Macron administration is in listening mode. . He insisted there would be a change of approach over the next five years, and on pensions they would redouble consultation to \"hear people's anxieties\". . Asking the French people to work three more years before they collect their pensions is not exactly a popular move, so Mr Macron is at pains to say he is flexible on how it is brought in and when. And yet his finance minister did not rule out forcing it through without a vote if they had to.. For a president sometimes dubbed Jupiter for perceived arrogance, observers see this as a critical moment for him to adapt.. \"He must accept the idea that negotiation is important, it doesn't mean top-down decisions,\" says Michel Wieviorka. \"I think it's difficult for him psychologically and culturally to change to a more democratic way of politics.\". In his victory speech, Mr Macron declared he was no longer a candidate in one camp but the president for everybody. No-one would be left by the wayside, he vowed. . He also insisted that the next five years would be handled differently from the last, without explaining how. He may not have long to prove it..
