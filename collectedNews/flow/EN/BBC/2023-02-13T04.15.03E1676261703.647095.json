        "content": "The earthquake, untroubled by international borders, has brought havoc to both countries. But the international relief effort has been thwarted by checkpoints. In southern Turkey, thousands of rescue workers with heavy lifting gear, paramedics and sniffer dogs have jammed the streets, and are still working to find survivors. In this part of opposition-held north-west Syria, none of this is going on. . I had just crossed the border from four days in the city of Antakya, Turkey, where the aid response is a cacophony - ambulance sirens blare all night long, dozens of earth movers roar and rip apart concrete 24 hours a day. Among the olive groves in the village of Bsania, in Syria's Idlib province, there's mostly silence.. The homes in this border area were newly built. Now more than 100 have gone, turned to aggregate and a ghostly white dust which gusts across the farmland. As I climb over the chalky remains of the village, I spot a gap in the ruin. Inside, a pink-tiled bathroom sits perfectly preserved. . The earthquake swallowed Abu Ala's home, and claimed the lives of two of his children. . \"The bedroom is there, that's my house,\" he says, pointing to pile of rubble. \"My wife, daughter and I were sleeping here - Wala', the 15-year-old girl, was at the edge of the room towards the balcony. A bulldozer was able to find her, [so] I took her and buried her.\" . In the dark, he and his wife clung to olive trees as aftershocks rocked the hillside. . The Syrian Civil Defence Force - also known as the White Helmets - which operates in opposition-held areas, did what they could with pickaxes and crowbars. The rescuers, who receive funding from the British government, lack modern rescue equipment.. Abu Ala' breaks down when he describes the search for his missing 13-year-old son, Ala'. \"We kept digging until evening the next day. May God give strength to those men. They went through hell to dig my boy up.\" . He buried the boy next to his sister. . Bsania wasn't much, but it was home. Rows of modern apartment buildings, with balconies facing out across the Syrian countryside into Turkey. Abu Ala' describes it as a thriving community. \"We had nice neighbours, nice people. [They] are dead now.\". A deeply religious man, he is now bereft. \"What am I going to do?\" he asks. \"There are no tents, no aid, nothing. We've received nothing but God's mercy until now. And I'm here left to roam the streets.\" . As we leave, he asks me if I have a tent. But we have nothing to give him. . I meet up with the White Helmets, expecting to find them looking for survivors. But it is too late. Ismail al Abdullah, is weary from effort, and what he describes as the world's disregard for the Syrian people. He says the international community has blood on its hands. . \"We stopped looking for survivors after more than 120 hours passed,\" he says. \"We tried our best to save our people, but we couldn't. No-one listened to us. . \"From the first hour we called for urgent action, for urgent help. No-one responded. They were just saying, 'We are with you', nothing else. We said, we need equipment. No-one responded.\" . Apart from a few Spanish doctors, no international aid teams have reached this part of Syria. It is an enclave of resistance from Bashar al-Assad's rule. Under Turkish protection, it is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group that was once affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has cut those links, but almost all governments have no relations with them. For our entire time in Syria, armed men, who didn't want to be filmed, accompanied us and stood at a distance. . More than a decade into Syria's stalled civil war, the 1.7m people who live in this area continue to oppose President Assad's rule. They live in makeshift camps and newly built shelters. Most have been displaced more than once, so life here was already very hard before the earthquake. . The international help that reaches this part of Syria is tiny. Many of the earthquake victims were taken to the Bab al-Hawa hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. They treated 350 patients in the immediate aftermath, general surgeon Dr Farouk al Omar tells me, all with only one ultrasound. . When I ask him about international aid, he shakes his head, and laughs. \"We cannot talk more about this topic. We spoke about that a lot. And nothing happened. Even in a normal situation, we don't have enough medical staff. And just imagine what it's like in this catastrophe after earthquake,\" he says. . At the end of the corridor, a tiny baby lies in an incubator. Mohammad Ghayyath Rajab's skull is bruised and bandaged, and his small chest rises and falls thanks to a respirator. Doctors can't be sure, but they think he's around three months old. Both of his parents were killed in the earthquake, and a neighbour found him crying alone in the dark in the rubble of his home. . The Syrian people have been forsaken many times, and tell me they have grown used to being disregarded. But still there is anger that more help is not forthcoming. . In the town of Harem, Fadel Ghadab lost his aunt and cousin. . \"How is it possible that the UN has sent a mere 14 trucks worth of aid?\" he asks. \"We've received nothing here. People are in the streets.\" . More aid has made it into Syria, but not much and it is too little, too late. . In the absence of international rescue teams in Harem, children remove rubble. A man and two boys use a car-jack to prize apart the collapsed remains of a building, carefully salvaging animal feed onto a blanket. Life isn't cheaper in Syria, but it is more precarious.. The day is ending and I have to leave. I cross the border back into Turkey and soon get stuck in a traffic jam or ambulances, construction equipment - the gridlock of a national and international aid response. . My phone pings with a message from a Turkish rescuer telling me his team found a woman alive after 132 hours buried under her home. Behind me in Syria, as darkness falls, there is only silence. . ",

Palestinians see settlements as a major obstacle to a peace deal with Israel.. They want all settlements and outposts to be removed from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which they seek for a future Palestinian state.. Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 600,000 Jews since it occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.. Also on Sunday, Israeli authorities announced mass construction of new homes within established settlements.. A statement from Mr Netanyahu's office said a planning committee would convene in the coming days to approve new settlement homes. . The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Twitter these would number 10,000.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's administration said Sunday's announcement should be \"condemned and rejected\".. There has been no immediate comment from the US, but ambassador Thomas Nides previously made clear Washington would oppose such moves.. \"We want to keep a vision of a two-state solution alive.

        "content": "Meanwhile, unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places. . The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 33,000.. More arrests are expected - but the action will be seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. . Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.. With elections looming, .  after spending 20 years in power.. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone, he appeared to blame fate. \"Such things have always happened,\" he said. \"It's part of destiny's plan.\". On the sixth day after the quake hit, the situation is growing more desperate. . On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province. Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.. \"There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,\" Austrian Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said. \"The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.\". The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. On Sunday, the number dead in Turkey rose to more than 29,000.. Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. . Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening.. The border crossing between Turkey and Armenia reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "The regions of Northland and Auckland are currently under a state of emergency. . Parts of the North Island were badly damaged by flooding only weeks ago. . Northland declared a state of emergency then too over fears of unprecedented rain, but those concerns proved to be unfounded.. This time, however, gale force winds and heavy rain have been reported, leaving as many as 22,000 people at a time without power in the region, according to local media. . Some residents have been warned that it may take days for power to be restored. . Far North mayor Moko Tepani told Television New Zealand that he thought the roof of his house was going to blow off because the wind was so strong. . People who knew their homes were flood-prone were advised to evacuate ahead of the storm's arrival. . Declaring a state of emergency gives local authorities greater power to respond to dangerous situations and allows them to restrict travel and provide aid.. Further south in the country's largest city, Auckland, there have also been reports of people losing power due to strong winds. . Authorities issued a red weather alert - meaning severe gales, flooding and land slips are possible. . Schools have once again been advised to move learning online, trains have been cancelled and emergency shelters have been set up in preparation for the storm. . Air New Zealand, the country's national carrier, has announced it would cancel multiple long-haul international fights, Tasman and Pacific Island flights, and domestic services in and out of Auckland planned for Monday, when the worst of the bad weather is expected. . Thousands of homes suffered damage in January's record-breaking rainfall, which caused severe flooding and landslides, and four people died.. Residents are on high alert as they have been warned that the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure from the recent deluge could mean parts of the city will flood again more easily.. They have been using sandbags to try and people protect their houses and long queues have been forming at supermarkets after the authorities advised people to have enough supplies to last at least three days in case the situation deteriorated. . \"The water was knee-deep,\" one man who was filling up sandbags and a public facility told Television New Zealand. \"You never know what`s going to happen in the next two days.\". \"We had the creak behind us burst its banks, and it was pretty much against our back fence,\" said another. . New Zealand's prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has asked people to take the severe weather warnings seriously and to make sure they are prepared. . \"Central and local government have been working very closely to prepare for this event and also to make sure the early lessons that can be captured from our response a week or two back can be incorporated into this one.\". Thousands of people are already reported to be without power on the Coromandel Peninsula - where major roads connecting the mainly rural communities have been closed or are under warnings. . Residents in vulnerable areas there and in Tairāwhiti have also been urged to seriously consider evacuating.. The latter region, which lies New Zealand's east coast, is especially prone to flooding. . Instances where residents in small towns and settlements have had to band together to protect each other and their properties have become more common in recent years. . This video can not be played. Storm Gabrielle hits New Zealand. The tiny Australian territory of Norfolk Island, which lies north of New Zealand, had a lucky escape after the storm's most destructive winds bypassed it. . Norfolk Island's emergency controller, George Plant, told ABC News there were some emergency calls but that an initial assessment suggests the damage was \"manageable\". . \"We're feeling very fortunate as a community that we didn't cop the full brunt of what Gabrielle had to offer,\" resident Hannah Taylor said. . \"If she had moved a few a little bit south, we would have seen a lot more damage.\".

        "content": "The object could have interfered with commercial air traffic as it was traveling at 20,000ft (6,100m), a Pentagon statement said.. It was first detected above military sites in Montana on Saturday, it added.. The object, which was not deemed a military threat, has been described by defence officials as unmanned and octagonal in shape. It was downed by a missile fired from an F-16 fighter jet at 14:42 local time (19:42 GMT).. The incident raised further questions about the spate of high-altitude objects that have been shot down over North America this month. . A suspected Chinese spy balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February after hovering for days over the continental US. Officials said it originated in China and had been used to monitor sensitive sites.. China denied the object was used for spying and said it was a weather monitoring device that had been blown astray. The incident - and the angry exchanges in its aftermath - ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Beijing.. On Sunday, a defence official said the US had communicated with Beijing about the first object after receiving no response for several days. It was not immediately clear what was discussed.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three further high-altitude objects in as many days.. President Biden ordered an object to be shot down over Alaska on Friday, and on Saturday a similar object was shot down over the Yukon in north-western Canada.. Officials have not publicly identified the origin or purpose of these objects. Both the US and Canada are still working to recover the remnants, but the search in Alaska has been hampered by Arctic conditions.. \"These objects did not closely resemble, and were much smaller than, the [4 February] balloon and we will not definitively characterise them until we can recover the debris,\" a White House National Security spokesperson said.. US military shoots down suspected surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina. It had drifted for days over the US, and officials said it came from China and had been monitoring sensitive sites . US downs another object off northern Alaska which officials said lacked any system of propulsion or control. An American fighter jet shoots down a \"high-altitude airborne object\" over Canada's Yukon territory, about 100 miles (160 km) from the US border. It was described as cylindrical and smaller than the first balloon. US jets shoot down a fourth high-altitude object near Lake Huron \"out of an abundance of caution\" . Later on Sunday, the US Air Force general overseeing North American airspace said he had not ruled any explanation out - including extraterrestrial life.. \"I'll let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out. I haven't ruled out anything,\" Gen Glen VanHerck told reporters after being asked about the possibility of aliens.. One senior official told ABC News that the three most recent objects to be shot down were likely weather balloons and not surveillance devices.. But this was contradicted by the top Democrat in Congress, who earlier told the broadcaster that intelligence officials believed the objects were in fact surveillance balloons.. \"They believe they were [balloons], yes,\" . , adding that they were \"much smaller\" than the first one shot down off the South Carolina coast.. \"The bottom line is, until a few months ago, we didn't know of these balloons,\" he said. . Democrat Debbie Dingell, one of several Michigan members of Congress who applauded the military for downing the object over the state on Sunday, joined growing calls for the White House and defence officials to provide more information.. \"We need the facts about where they are originating from, what their purpose is, and why their frequency is increasing,\" she said.. Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who represents Montana, told the BBC's US partner CBS: \"What's gone on the last two weeks or so... has been nothing short of craziness. And the military needs to have a plan to not only determine what's out there, but determine the dangers.\". Republicans have repeatedly criticised the Biden administration for its handling of the first suspected spy balloon, saying it should have been shot down far sooner.. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK would conduct a security review following the recent incidents in the US and Canada. \"This development is another sign of how the global threat picture is changing for the worse,\" he said..
