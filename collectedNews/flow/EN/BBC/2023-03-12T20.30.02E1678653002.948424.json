        "content": "Opponents say they threaten democracy.. At one of Saturday's rallies, opposition leader Yair Lapid said this was Israel's \"greatest crisis\".. In a separate development, Israeli troops shot dead three armed Palestinians near the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday, the Israeli army said. It said the gunmen had fired at an Israeli army post. . Palestinian officials have not commented on the incident. There has been a marked surge in violence between Palestinians and Israel . On Saturday, protest organisers said as many as 500,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Israel for the 10th consecutive week, in what the Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".. About 200,000 people turned up in Tel Aviv - many carrying Israel's national flag - to rally against planned reforms by Mr Netanyahu's hardline government.. A BBC producer in the city described the protests as the busiest yet, with a non-stop flow of demonstrators packing the streets until late into the night. . In remarkable scenes, crowds applauded Tel Aviv police chief Amichai Eshed as he walked in uniform through the rally. . On Thursday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had said he was transferring Mr Eshed to head a training division, amid reports the ultra-nationalist politician accused the commander of being too soft on protesters, whom he calls \"anarchists\". . But Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara later overruled Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the decision was being frozen, while national police chief Kobi Shabtai on Saturday said he had \"made a mistake\" in dismissing Eshed. . The clash over the commander's position is significant. It comes amid predictions of a possible constitutional crisis, involving Israel's civil service and security forces being unable to take orders from the government, if no compromise is reached on the planned reforms, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.. Speaking at the demonstrations in Tel Aviv, former Israel police chief Moshe Karadi described Mr Ben-Gvir's control of the force as an unprecedented danger. . He said the minister was \"a convicted felon, enacting a hostile takeover of the police and trying to turn it into a private militia to serve his political purposes\".. Mr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting terrorism over his backing of a Jewish extremist group. He has said police would have \"zero tolerance\" of demonstrators who block roads, with forces using water cannon and stun grenades against protesters last week. . Speaking in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Mr Lapid warned that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis.. \"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday .  But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.. In the northern city of Haifa, a record crowd of 50,000 marched on Saturday. . The reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges, and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. Last Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.. The government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Watch: The Mexican kidnapping saga explained in 80 seconds. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) said that drug cartel violence represented a significant threat for anyone crossing into Mexico.. It comes after four Americans . Two of them were murdered, while two were released unharmed.. Three American women who went to Mexico to sell clothes at a market have been missing for more than two weeks.. \"Drug cartel violence and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat to anyone who crosses into Mexico right now,\" said DPS director Steven McCraw. . \"Based on the volatile nature of cartel activity and the violence we are seeing there, we are urging individuals to avoid travel to Mexico at this time.\". Four Americans were kidnapped by a drug cartel, and two of them were murdered, when they visited the town of Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this month. A Mexican bystander was also killed in the shooting.. The cartel responsible has since apologised for the incident and handed over its own gunmen to the police.. A letter left with the cartel gunmen, who had been left on the roadside, accused them of acting \"under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\" as well as supposedly breaking cartel rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\".. It was signed by the \"Scorpions Group\", a splinter faction of the powerful Gulf Cartel.. Mexican authorities believe the gang members mistook the Americans for rivals and shot at them when they tried to escape.. The incident threatens to sour relations between the two countries. . A Republican senator has urged President Joe Biden's administration to allow the deployment of US troops over the border to fight the cartels. . Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called the proposals \"arrogant\".. Meanwhile, two sisters from Texas and a friend are missing in Mexico after they crossed the border last month to sell clothes at a flea market, US officials say.. The husband of one of the women reported their disappearance to police in Texas after days going by without news. . \"We don't know if they made it there,\" Roel Bermea, police chief in the border town of Penitas, told the AFP news agency. . The FBI had been notified, he added.. ",

Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser, Cate Blanchett and Michelle Yeoh are the frontrunners in the acting categories.. The 2023 awards season has been one of the most unpredictable of recent years, with three of the four acting categories too close to call. . Winners have varied at the other major ceremonies, such as the SAG Awards, Baftas and Golden Globes, and there is a lack of consensus over who will triumph at the Oscars as a result.. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.. It will be the chat show host's third time hosting the Academy Awards. He most recently presided over the 2018 event.. The US comic is probably trying to forget about the other occasion, in 2017, when .  after the wrong best picture winner was mistakenly announced.. As part of a media call at the Dolby Theatre on Wednesday, Kimmel joked about how the venue's red carpet has changed colour for the first time since 1960.. Referring to .  Kimmel said: \"People have been asking if there's going to be any trouble this year, is there going to be any violence this year? . \"I certainly hope not. But if there is, I think the decision to go with a champagne carpet rather than a red carpet shows how confident we are that no blood will be shed.\". The decision to change the carpet's colour was actually made for practical reasons, .  The new one means organisers \"can transition more seamlessly from daytime arrivals to an elegant evening setting\".. Viewers in the US can watch the Oscars live on ABC. The network is also streaming the ceremony on its website and app.. In the UK, Sky will air the ceremony across four of its channels simultaneously - Sky Arts, Sky News, Sky Showcase and Sky Cinema Oscars.. Unusually, that means British viewers can watch the Oscars on Freeview and Freesat. It will also be available on streaming service Now (formerly Now TV). . The ceremony starts at 17:00 PT / 20:00 ET on Sunday. In the UK, it starts at midnight as Sunday becomes Monday.. The prizes are scheduled to be handed out over three hours - but the ceremony runs late almost every year, often by at least 30 minutes.. Traditionally, the four acting winners from the previous year's Oscars come back to present the prizes to their successors.. This year, three of 2022's winners are returning - Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur - but the fourth, Will Smith, is absent as .  for 10 years.. Other stars presenting categories this year include Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Samuel L Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, John Travolta, Emily Blunt, Glenn Close, Jennifer Connelly and Florence Pugh.. Interestingly, Halle Berry has also been invited to present. She remains the only woman of colour to win best leading actress at the Oscars, but we could see the second this year with Yeoh.. Other category presenters include Paul Dano, Andrew Garfield, Cara Delevingne, Kate Hudson, Michael B Jordan, Jonathan Majors, Mindy Kaling, Eva Longoria, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Andie MacDowell and Riz Ahmed.. They will be joined by Antonio Banderas, Elizabeth Banks, Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek Pinault, Melissa McCarthy, Halle Bailey, Janelle Monáe, Questlove, Elizabeth Olsen and Pedro Pascal.. Excitingly, this year's winners are the hardest to predict for some time, due to the variation at the many precursor ceremonies. . The only acting category awards pundits are confident about is Everything Everywhere All At Once star .  winning best supporting actor. . Otherwise, it's all to play for. .  (The Whale) and .

Best picture is decided via a preferential ballot - Academy members are asked to rank the 10 nominated films from favourite to least favourite..

For example, a crowd pleaser such as .  could be a dark horse in the best picture race due to the large number of second and third place votes it is likely to have received.. Rihanna will take to the Academy Awards stage exactly one month since .  She will perform Lift Me Up (from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), which is nominated for best original song. .

Officially, these are the Academy Awards, but they have been known affectionately as the Oscars for decades.. There are three possible sources. One is the late US columnist Sidney Skolsky, who claimed he gave the award its nickname.. Actress Bette Davis claimed that the name derived from her observation that the backside of the statuette looked like that of her husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson.. But the most popular theory is one attributed to former Academy librarian Margaret Herrick, who declared that the golden statuette looked like her uncle Oscar.. ",
