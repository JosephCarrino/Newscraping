        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Four US citizens were kidnapped by armed men on 3 March while driving into the city of Matamoros in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, across the border from Texas. . They had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.  . One man, named only as José \"N\", 24, from Tamaulipas, has been arrested.. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \"We offer our deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who were killed in these attacks.\". The two surviving victims were delivered to the US on Tuesday in co-operation with the US consulate in Matamoros, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica . .. They were brought back under armed escort by a heavily armed Mexican military convoy.. The FBI later confirmed that two Americans were found dead and that the other two have been brought to American hospitals for treatment. . \"One of the surviving victims sustained serious injuries during the attack,\" the FBI said. . The statement added that the agency will work with international partners and other law enforcement agencies to \"hold those responsible for this horrific and violent attack accountable for their crimes\".   . The bodies of Zindell Brown and Shaeed Woodard have been recovered and are being repatriated, US officials said.. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said: \"We are very sorry that this happened in our country and we send our condolences to the families of the victims, friends, and the United States government, and we will continue doing our work to guarantee peace and tranquillity.\". The injured Americans were named by family members as Latavia \"Tay\" McGee, a mother of six from South Carolina, and Eric James Williams.. The four were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said this week.. Video shows them being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men. One is manhandled on to the vehicle while others appear to be unconscious and are dragged to the truck.. A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander more than one block away, was killed in last Friday's incident.. At a news conference later on Tuesday, Mexican officials confirmed a 24-year-old man had been arrested and that the four Americans were discovered at a wooden shack outside Matamoros.. The victims had been transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday \"to create confusion\", officials say.. Investigators think the Gulf Cartel, one of the oldest organised crime groups in Mexico, is responsible for the attack, a US law enforcement source told CBS. . It is still unclear whether the Americans were ambushed, mistaken for competing drug traffickers, or were caught in cross-fire between warring factions. . US state department officials said on Tuesday that the investigation was still in the early stages. . Ms McGee was said to be travelling to the Mexican border town to have a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat.. Her mother Barbara Burgess told ABC News that she had asked her daughter not to go, but her daughter had reassured her she would be safe. . The FBI offered a $50,000 (£42,000) reward for the return of the Americans. . Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US state department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".. Medical tourism is common, particularly among people living in US border states. . But Matamoros is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, as drug cartels control large swathes of the state of Tamaulipas and can hold more power than local law enforcement.   . ",

        "content": "A top congressional Republican gave Mr Carlson exclusive access to the video.. But some Republicans say the Fox host mischaracterised the raid on Congress. . The top-rated host on Fox News, a conservative network, has long insisted that other media outlets exaggerated violence at the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the complex as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. He has also suggested without evidence that government agents could have instigated the riot.. In the roughly 45-minute segment, Mr Carlson said the video showed that while a minority of protesters did commit violence, most were \"sightseers\". . His show on Tuesday night included an interview with Tarik Johnson, a former Capitol Police officer who said he donned a pro-Trump red hat during the riot in order to help fellow officers escape the melee.. Mr Carlson questioned why intelligence about possible violence on 6 January wasn't relayed to rank-and-file officers, but he did not broadcast much new video from the riot. . Criticism of Monday's segment came from Democrats as well as top Republicans in Washington, the head of the Capitol police, and the family of a police officer whose death was mentioned by Mr Carlson in the show.. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday it had been a \"mistake for Fox News to depict this in a way that's completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks\" about the riot. . Mr McConnell pointed to an internal memo by Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, whose agency is responsible for protecting the buildings where the lawmakers meet.. In that memo, Mr Manger says the primetime Monday broadcast was \"filled with offensive and misleading conclusions about the January 6 attack\".. \"The programme conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video,\" he wrote. . \"The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before or during these less tense moments.\". During Monday's programme, the Fox host showed footage of the \"QAnon Shaman\" - a man named Jacob Chansley - wandering around the Capitol building trailed by police officers who show no signs, at least in the clips broadcast, of attempting to stop or arrest him. . Chansley, who was bare-chested and wearing a headdress made of fur and horns that day, became one of the most recognisable figures from the Capitol riot. . He pleaded guilty in September 2021 to obstructing an official proceeding and is currently serving a 41-month prison sentence.. This video can not be played. Jacob Chansley spoke from jail about his role in the Capitol riots.. Mr Carlson said the videos - which have not been viewed by the BBC or any other media organisation in full - showed that police had acted as Chansley's \"tour guide\". . This version of events was rejected by Mr Manger, who called the allegation \"outrageous and false\". . \"Those officers did their best to use de-escalation tactics to try to talk rioters into getting each other to leave the building,\" he wrote.. The justice department says about 140 police officers were assaulted that day. . Around 1,000 people have been arrested so far in connection with the riot, most of them charged with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building, according to justice department figures.. More than 300 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including more than 100 who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to a police officer. . Mr Carlson also focused on Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed after returning to his office during the siege and died the next day.. Fox News showed footage of Mr Sicknick continuing to perform his duties inside the Capitol after being pepper-sprayed. . \"Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not to do with the violence he suffered outside the Capitol,\" Mr Carlson said. . In April 2021, a medical examiner found that Mr Sicknick had died of natural causes from a medical condition not brought on by an injury.. On Tuesday Mr Sicknick's family issued a statement saying they were \"outraged\" at the coverage and lambasted the network as \"propaganda\".. Meanwhile, there were new revelations on Tuesday night from a $1.6bn (£1.2bn) defamation case filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News. The electronic voting firm accuses the network of promoting baseless claims of vote-rigging.. The latest legal filings in the case reportedly suggest that two days before the Capitol riot Mr Carlson wrote in text about his \"hate\" for Mr Trump, . \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\" he wrote on 4 January 2021, according to US media. \"I truly can't wait.\". \"I hate him passionately,\" he added.. The filing emerged as Mr Trump himself posted on his social media platform Truth Social in all capital letters: \"Great job by Tucker Carlson tonight.\". ",

        "content": " which cites anonymous US intelligence officials who suggest a pro-Ukrainian group was to blame.. In a separate report, German media say investigators believe they identified the boat used to plant the explosives.. Gas deliveries through the pipeline had been suspended before the blasts.. Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in August last year, claiming it needed maintenance. Nord Stream 2 had never been put into service. . The exact cause of the 26 September blasts that hit the natural gas pipelines is unknown, but it is widely believed they were attacked. . Moscow has blamed the West for the explosions and called on the UN's Security Council to independently investigate them. . Nato and Western leaders have stopped short of directly accusing Russia, although the EU has previously said Russia uses its gas pipelines as a weapon against the West.. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. . Citing anonymous US officials, the report said there was no evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation.. The US newspaper reported that the officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or \"any details of the strength of the evidence it contains\".. It added: \"Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two.\". Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the Ukrainian government \"was absolutely not involved\" in the sabotage. In a statement in response to the New York Times report, Mr Podolyak added that Kyiv had no information about what had happened.. In response to the report, Russia's deputy UN envoy Dmitry Polyanskiy said: \"[It] only proves that our initiative on launching an international investigation under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General is very timely.\". Also on Tuesday, German newspaper Die Zeit reported that German authorities had made a breakthrough in their investigation into the cause of the attacks.. According to joint research published by the paper and other German media organisations, the boat used to plant the explosives was a yacht hired from a firm based in Poland, which reportedly belonged to two Ukrainians. The nationalities of those who carried out the attack were unclear. . However, the paper says German investigators have not yet found any evidence as to who ordered the destruction. It also points out that there is still the possibility of a false flag operation which was intended to point towards Ukraine. . At least 50m (164ft) of the underwater Nord Stream 1 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany is thought to have been destroyed by September's blast.. Danish police believe \"powerful explosions\" blew four holes in the pipe and its newer twin, Nord Stream 2.. German, Danish and Swedish authorities have all been investigating the incident. . For decades, Russia supplied huge amounts of natural gas to Europe. But after the war in Ukraine began in February last year, most European countries drastically reduced their reliance on Russian energy. . This video can not be played.

        "content": "Watch: Police in Georgia fire water cannon and pepper spray at protesters. Riot police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse the crowds outside the parliament building. . Some protesters were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags. . The government says several policemen were hurt and police gear was damaged. . There has been widespread international condemnation of the bill, which would require non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and  independent media who receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as foreign agents. . The opposition described it as a Russian-style law that would stigmatise and clamp down on Georgia's vibrant civil society and independent media.. Russia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media. . \"The law is Russian as we all know... We don't want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency. . The country's President, Salome Zourabichvili, says she supports the protesters, saying they represented what she called free Georgia which saw its future in Europe.. But inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law.. On Monday, a committee hearing into the proposed legislation ended in a parliamentary brawl. . Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\". . It added that parliament's advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia's clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\". . The two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People's Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party. . The group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). . Georgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency. . At a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy's statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. Brussels is currently considering Georgia's application for EU candidate status.. On Tuesday evening, the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the draft legislation was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. This video can not be played.

The storm has already broken records for the strength it has accumulated and the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean.. Its longevity and strength have drawn the interest of weather experts globally.. The cyclone developed off the north Australian Coast in early February and then travelled thousands of kilometres across the southern Indian Ocean, affecting Mauritius and La Réunion, before making landfalls in Madagascar two weeks later and then Mozambique.. Experts say that is a very rare path for such a storm to take.. It already holds the record for highest accumulated cyclone energy in the southern hemisphere. That is a measure of a storm's strength over time.. Mozambique is now bracing for a second landfall, whilst still reeling from the rains and floods brought by the cyclone.. Madagascar received around three times its usual monthly average rainfall in the past week alone..

        "content": "'Barbaric' abortion law nearly killed these Texas women. Texas bars abortions except for medical emergencies, with doctors facing punishment of up to 99 years in jail.. According to the lawsuit, doctors are refusing the procedure even in extreme cases out of fear of prosecution.. In a statement, the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton said he would \"enforce the laws\" of the state. . Mr Paxton \"is committed to doing everything in his power to protect mothers, families, and unborn children\", the statement said.. The Center for Reproductive Justice has filed the legal action on behalf of the five women - Ashley Brandt, Lauren Hall, Lauren Miller, Anna Zargarian and Amanda Zurawski - and two healthcare providers that are also plaintiffs. . The pro-choice group said it is the first time pregnant women themselves have taken action against anti-abortion laws passed across the US since the Supreme Court last year removed constitutional protection for abortion rights.. \"It is now dangerous to be pregnant in Texas,\" said Nancy Northup, the centre's president on Tuesday. . With Ms Northup outside the Texas Capitol in Austin on Tuesday, the plaintiffs - two pregnant - shared harrowing stories of their previous, lost pregnancies. . According to the legal action, all were told that their foetuses would not survive, but were not given the option of an abortion, which they described as \"standard medical procedure\" throughout the country and in the state before Texas' ban came into effect.. Ms Zurawski, 35, said she had become pregnant after 18 months of fertility treatments. She had just entered her second trimester when she was told she had dilated prematurely and that the loss of her foetus, whom she and her husband had named Willow, was \"inevitable\".  . \"But even though we would, with complete certainty, lose Willow, my doctor could not intervene while her heart was still beating or until I was sick enough for the ethics board at the hospital to consider my life at risk,\" Ms Zurawski said. . For three days, trapped in a \"bizarre and avoidable hell\", Ms Zurawski was forced to wait until her body entered sepsis - also known as blood poisoning - and doctors were allowed to perform an abortion, according to the lawsuit. . Ms Zurawski spent three days in intensive care, leaving the hospital after a week, the legal action says. The ordeal has made it harder for her to conceive in future, she said. . The four other women had to travel outside Texas for an abortion. . One of the plaintiffs, Ms Miller, said: \"Healthcare should not be determined by some politician with no understanding of medicine or the critical role that abortion care plays in pregnancy. How is it that I can get an abortion for a dog but not for me?\". Two of the women's foetuses had conditions that meant they did not develop a skull, according to the lawsuit.. These cases \"are just tip of the iceberg\", the Center for Reproductive Justice's Ms Northup said.. Their 91-page complaint asks for a ruling that clarifies Texas' law and its stance on \"medical emergencies\" for pregnant women facing grave health risks.  . \"With the threat of losing their medical licences, fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and up to 99 years in prison lingering over their heads, it is no wonder that doctors and hospitals are turning patients away - even patients in medical emergencies,\" the lawsuit reads.. , 61% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, though the opinion poll found public support for the procedure fell as a pregnancy progressed.. Texas' legislature, which is under Republican control, has been at the forefront of anti-abortion legislation, becoming the first state to enact a near-total ban. . And the state will be home to another abortion battle soon: a Texas judge is expected to rule on a case about abortion pills this week. . The Trump-appointed US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will decide whether Mifepristone - one of the two drugs used in an abortion pill regime - can continue to be sold in the US. . ",
