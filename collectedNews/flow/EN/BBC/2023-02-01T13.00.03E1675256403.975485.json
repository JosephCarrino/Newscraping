        "content": "A lack of rest may explain why males of the carnivorous marsupials typically mate themselves to death in one breeding season, experts say.. Females, on the other hand, can live and reproduce for up to four years.. \"They cover large distances to mate as often as possible and it seems that their drive is so strong that they forgo sleeping to spend more time searching for females,\" said  Christofer Clemente, senior lecturer at the University of the Sunshine Coast. His institution led the study with The University of Queensland. The research was published on Wednesday. . Researchers collected data over 42 days after fitting backpacks with trackers on wild roaming male and female northern quolls on Groote Eylandt, an island off the coast of Australia's Northern Territory. . Some quolls they studied walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) in one night, which translates to nearly 40km in human distance, based on average stride length, the study said.. Males of the species also appeared to attract more parasites. The most likely reason: they devote less time to grooming so they can make the most of each breeding season. Researchers said the males are not as vigilant as females while searching for food or avoiding predators. . \"Sleep deprivation, and associated symptoms for a prolonged duration would make recuperation impossible and could explain the causes of death recorded in the males after breeding season,\" said Joshua Gaschk, the study's lead author. \"They become easy prey, are unable to avoid vehicle collisions, or simply die from exhaustion.\" . Mr Gaschk added that the initial data points to the need for further studies on how sleep deprivation affects quolls and wider families of marsupial mammals found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.. \"If male quolls forgo sleep to the detriment of their survival, northern quolls [will become] an excellent model species for the effects of sleep deprivation on body function,\" he said.. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, there are some 100,000 northern quolls remaining but the population has been \"undergoing rapid decline\". Loss of habitat due to development and attacks by stray cats pose a serious threat, and they are also particularly vulnerable to being poisoned by cane toads. . ",

        "content": "Estimates say around a million gathered for the open-air mass at N'dole airport, on the second of the pontiff's six-day visit to Africa.. Around half of DR Congo's population is Catholic - the largest Catholic community in Africa.. Speaking at the mass, the Catholic leader called for peace in DR Congo, saying warring sides should forgive one another and grant their opponents a \"great amnesty of the heart\".. He went on to espouse the benefits of cleansing one's heart of \"anger and remorse, of every trace of resentment and hostility\".. Wednesday's mass was tipped to be one of the pope's largest-ever masses, second only to one held in the Philippines in 2014, according to Christopher Lamb, the Rome correspondent of the Catholic magazine The Tablet.. In an interview with the BBC's Newsday radio programme, he said Catholicism was growing in Africa: \"This is the future of the church and the growth of the Catholic Church in Africa really is so important to the future of Catholicism.\". On Tuesday, the Pope met President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi and delivered a speech condemning historical exploitation of Africa's resources, which he described as \"economic colonialism\".. He also addressed DR Congo's plight, as minerals have played a key role in more than three decades of armed conflict there: \"Hands off the Democratic Republic of the Congo! Hands off Africa! Stop choking Africa, it is not a mine to be stripped or a terrain to be plundered.\". However, a planned visit to the eastern city of Goma has been cancelled for security reasons. The eastern part of DR Congo is facing escalating violence as security services fight against armed militia groups. . According to the United Nations, some six million people have been forced to flee their homes in DR Congo.. That is one of the largest populations of displaced people in the world, alongside places like Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Ukraine.. Most of the displaced are in the eastern provinces of South Kivu, North Kivu and Ituri.. ",
