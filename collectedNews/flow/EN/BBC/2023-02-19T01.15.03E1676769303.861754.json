        "content": "Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities \"will be held to account\". Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of \"gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation\" since its invasion.. World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. . UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. . The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. . Ms Harris told the conference that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. . \"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,\" she said. . The UN defines crimes against humanity as a \"widespread or systemic attack\" on a particular civilian population.. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. . \"In the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity,\" Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, told the conference. . She cited \"barbaric and inhumane\" atrocities during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found .  shortly after the invasion and the . \"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,\" Ms Harris said.. This video can not be played. Evidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha. Crimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).. But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.. Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.. The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had \"waged a genocidal war\" because it did not think Ukrainians \"deserve to exist as a sovereign nation\".. Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.. This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It's a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. . Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. . But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. . Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. . It's opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. . There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia's invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "The Democrat served one term from 1977 to 1981. He was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan.. He has suffered from recent health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.. \"He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,\" the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday.. Mr Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator, tweeted that he visited \"both of my grandparents yesterday.\". \"They are at peace and - as always - their home is full of love. Thank you all for your kind words,\" he said. . In 2021, Mr Carter and his wife Roslyn celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They have four children together.. Born in Georgia in 1924, Mr Carter entered politics in the 1960s when he was elected as state senator, before becoming the state's governor in 1971.. Five years later he defeated the sitting Republican President Gerald Ford to become the 39th commander-in-chief. . But problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter as president. . At home, an oil crisis produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures.. The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treaty returning the Panama Canal to Panama.. But in 1979 the last Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in the aftermath. Mr Carter cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in response and introduced a trade embargo.. However, the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped as the US hostages were held for 444 days. His approval ratings took a further hit after an attempt to rescue the hostages failed and eight US military members were killed.. Iran then delayed the release of the hostages until after Ronald Reagan was sworn in.. Since leaving the White House, Mr Carter has remained active, carrying out humanitarian work with his Carter Center.. He led a delegation that sought to persuade military leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there.. He went on to gain an international reputation for his work in promoting human rights, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.. With Nelson Mandela, he founded The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights. . He also travelled extensively - well into his early 90s - and took part in annual trips to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity charity. . But the former president has also battled a host of health issues in recent years. In August 2015, Mr Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. . The following year he announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. . However, he has frequently expressed a striking calmness when dealing with his health challenges. . \"I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,\" he said in 2015. \"I've had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.\". Mr Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife were born between the First World War and the Great Depression, and where they returned when he left office. .
