        "content": "Austrian authorities put in place a level four avalanche alert - the second highest - following intense snowfall and wind in the area.. Despite the warnings, ski resorts in western Austria have been filling up due to school holidays in Vienna.. Austrian police announced five deaths on Sunday, including that of a 59-year-old man who was using a snow plough in the western region of Tyrol. . They also recovered the bodies of a ski guide in Sankt Anton am Arlberg and a 62-year-old man who was cross-country skiing around the summit of Hohe Aifner.. On Saturday, a 17-year-old New Zealander, a 32-year-old Chinese national and a German man in his 50s - who were all said to be skiing off designated ski trails when avalanches hit - were also found dead.. In Switzerland, a 56-year-old woman and 52-year-old man were also killed by unstable snow in the south-east canton of Graubuenden on Saturday morning. Swiss police said a third member of their group managed to escape unharmed. . Avalanches are common in both countries. According to Austria's APA news agency, 30 avalanches were reported in the Tyrol region on Saturday alone - 11 of these involving people.. Austria's level four alert level means \"very large avalanches are likely\" - it advises inexperienced skiers to remain on open ski runs and trails and for experienced skiers to stay away from very steep terrain..

        "content": "Fighter jets brought the craft down over US territorial waters on Saturday and debris is spread over a wide area.. The US believes the balloon was monitoring sensitive military sites.. Its discovery set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend's trip to China.. The Chinese authorities denied it was used for spying and insisted it was a weather ship blown astray. . Admiral Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Sunday he thought the Chinese military might have launched the balloon intentionally to disrupt Mr Blinken's trip to China. His visit would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.. Adm Mullen rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\". . \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Republican politicians. meanwhile, accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered.. Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN it was a \"brazen effort\" by China to embarrass the president ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday.. Brenda Bethune, the mayor of Myrtle Beach which is near to where the object was shot down, said: \"I do have concerns about how the federal government can allow a foreign adversary to fly uninterrupted from Montana to our doorstep.\". She said she hoped the government would explain how this happened and how they will prevent it from happening again.. The high-altitude balloon - thought to be the size of three buses - was shot out of the sky by a Sidewinder air-to-air missile fired from an F-22 jet fighter. It came down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT) on Saturday. . US TV networks broadcast the moment the missile struck, with the giant white object falling to the sea after a small explosion.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. Martin Willis said he was visiting Myrtle Beach when he filmed the fighter jet shoot down the suspected surveillance balloon. . He told the BBC he couldn't believe what he was witnessing. \"It was really exciting. It felt very historic,\" he said.. Police have warned people in the area not to touch or move any debris they find. \"Tampering could interfere in [the] investigation,\" Horry County Police Department said.. The remnants of the object landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than officials expected - and is spread over seven miles (11km).. Explaining the decision to shoot the balloon down, a US defence official said in a statement, that \"while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon's overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us\".. China's foreign ministry expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US's use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft\".. In a written statement, the Chinese government said it would \"resolutely safeguard\" the rights and interests of the company operating the balloon and that it reserved the right to \"make further responses if necessary\".. Mr Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk.. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast and advised mariners to leave the area.. Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty.. US military officials on Friday said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted over Latin America. The same day, Colombia's Air Force said an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. China has not commented publicly on the second balloon.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Beyoncé gets emotional on stage accepting record-breaking award. Beyoncé made history as she won best dance/electronic album for her euphoric dance opus, Renaissance.. In doing so, she overtook Hungarian-British conductor George Solti, whose record of 31 Grammys had stood for more than 20 years.. \"I'm trying not to be too emotional,\" said the star, accepting her prize.  . \"I'm trying to just receive this night.\". She went on to thank her family, including her late uncle Jonny, who helped make her stage outfits before she became famous.. Beyoncé has previously said his battle with HIV influenced her interest in dance music, and its historical ties to the LGBTQ community, on Renaissance.. Overall, Beyoncé won four prizes at the ceremony - but missed some of the early presentations after getting stuck in gridlocked downtown Los Angeles.. \"I'm surprised traffic could stop you,\" joked host Trevor Noah. \"I thought you travelled through space and time.\". Despite her success, Beyoncé was once again locked out of the coveted album of the year award.. She has now lost the prize four times, most notably in 2017 when her confessional masterpiece Lemonade was beaten by Adele's 25. . At the time, Adele used her acceptance speech to say Beyoncé was the more deserving winner (although she held on to the trophy).. This year, Harry Styles took the crown, with Grammy voters recognising the slick, radio-friendly pop of his third record Harry's House. . In his speech, the British star downplayed the importance of the prize. . \"On nights like tonight, it's obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music,\" said the singer.. \"I don't think any of us sit in the studio, making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these.\". However, he was visibly moved by the honour, adding: \"This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so, so nice.\". Earlier in the night, the star also won best pop album - receiving his award with a kiss from Jennifer Lopez. . \"This album from start to finish has been the greatest experience of my life,\" he said. \"From making it with two of my best friends to playing for people has been the greatest joy I could have asked for.\". Billed as \"music's biggest night\", the Grammys are the industry's most prestigious awards.. Sunday's show was attended by Adele, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z Shania Twain and Stevie Wonder, with performances from Lizzo, Steve Lacy and Brandi Carlile.. British artists had a good night, with indie duo Wet Leg winning two prizes, including best alternative album; and Sam Smith receiving best pop duo/group performance for Unholy, a duet with Kim Petras.. Smith's prize was their first Grammy since 2015, when they won four trophies, including best new artist.. However, the singer let Petras take the microphone to mark another historical achievement.. \"Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,\" said the German-born singer.. She went on to thank the late, transgender pop artist Sophie for \"kicking these doors open\", and Madonna \"for fighting for LGBTQ rights\", before dedicating the award to her mother.. \"I grew up next to nowhere in Germany and my mother believed me, that I was a girl,\" she said, as Smith looked on with pride. \"I wouldn't be here without her and her support.\". The duo later gave a sultry, BDSM-inspired performance of their ode to infidelity, introduced by Madonna.. \"If they call you shocking, scandalous, troublesome, problematic, provocative, or dangerous you're definitely onto something,\" said the star.. Adele also won best pop vocal performance for Easy On Me, dedicating the prize to her son Angelo.. The singer told the audience she had written the first verse \"in the shower when I was choosing to change my son's life\", by divorcing her then-husband, Simon Konecki.. She added: \"I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it's very old school and very brave.\". Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt was the surprise winner of song of the year - beating favourites Taylor Swift and Beyoncé with her sorrowful ballad Just Like That.. Voters were undoubtedly moved by Raitt's tender lyrics, in which a woman mourning the death of her son finds comfort from the man who received his heart in a transplant.. \"I'm so proud that you appreciate this one,\" said the 72-year-old, accepting her trophy.. Bad Bunny opened the show in an explosion of colour, replicating a Puerto Rican fiesta in the aisles of Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena.. His medley of El Apagón and Después De La Playa was enhanced with pyrotechnics, dozens of dancers and a troop of . the \"bighead\" puppets that march down the streets of San Juan every January.. He later won the prize for best Música Urbana album, in recognition of Un Verano Sin Ti, which spent 13 weeks at number one in the US last year.. \"I made this album with love and passion, and when you do things with love and passion, everything is easier,\" said the singer.. Other performances came from Americana star Brandi Carlile and Lizzo, who gave a gospel-infused take on her current single, Special.. She later won record of the year for About Damn Time, and used her speech to honour Prince, who gave her an early break on his song Boytrouble. . \"When we lost Prince, I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music.\" She also paid tribute to Beyoncé, calling her \"the artist of our lives\".. The in memoriam section gave an emotional send-off to stars like Olivia Newton-John, Irene Cara, David Crosby and Jeff Beck.. Kacey Musgraves played a heartfelt version of Coal Miner's Daughter in tribute to the \"Queen of Country\" Loretta Lynn; while Fleetwood Mac star Christine McVie was honoured with a performance of her signature hit, Songbird, by Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Fleetwood.. And Migos rapper Quavo played Without You - a song he wrote after the tragic death of his nephew and bandmate Takeoff last November. . In a more celebratory moment, the stage was taken over by more than two dozen rap icons, celebrating 50 years of hip-hop.. Turntable pioneer Grandmaster Flash kicked off the set with Flash Was On The Beat, cueing up an almost 12-minute trawl through the genre's greatest hits.. Run-DMC played Rock The Bells, Public Enemy delivered a verse of Yo, Bum Rush The Show, Missy Elliot swept in for Lose Control and Busta Rhymes gave a show-stopping performance of his high-velocity rap from Chris Brown's Look At Me Now..
