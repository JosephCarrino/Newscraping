        "content": "Turkey and Syria earthquake: Drone footage shows Turkey earthquake aftermath. Mr Erdogan said that the death toll in Turkey has risen to 3,549 people.. More than 1,600 people are reported to have died in Syria.. In a televised address, Mr Erdogan said the state of emergency is to ensure that rescue work can be \"carried out quickly\" in the country's south-east.. He said the measures would allow relief workers and financial aid into the affected regions, but did not give further details. . The state of emergency will end just before elections on 14 May, when Mr Erdogan will attempt to stay in power after 20 years.. Turkey last imposed a state of emergency in 2016 .  It was lifted two years later.. Rescuers in Turkey are battling heavy rain and snow as they race against the clock to find survivors of the earthquake that struck in the early hours of Monday.. The World Health Organization has warned the toll may rise dramatically as rescuers find more victims. . Thousands of children may be among the dead following the earthquake and aftershocks, the United Nations has said.. Heavy machinery worked through the night in the city of .  with lights illuminating the collapsed buildings and huge slabs of concrete, in scenes repeated across southern Turkey. . Occasionally the work stopped and a call of \"Allahu Akbar\" rose up when a survivor was found, or when the dead were recovered.. Adana is full of the homeless - those who lost their homes and others too fearful of aftershocks to return.. Some left without shoes, coats and phone chargers. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing later this week.. The 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) on Monday at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep, according to the US Geological Survey. . A later tremor had a magnitude of 7.5 and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. . On Tuesday morning, traffic was at a standstill on the main highway to the Turkish city of . , close to the epicentre of the quake.. Cars occasionally crawled forward, the wet road illuminated by glowing red brake lights. Few rescuers have made it to this part of southern Turkey yet.. One search and rescue team on their way to the city, their van loaded with specialist equipment and supplies, told the BBC they were eager to start looking for survivors, but they had no idea how bad the devastation would be when they arrived.. Nationally, 8,000 people have been rescued from more than 4,700 destroyed buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said in its latest statement.. As aftershocks continue, rescuers in some areas have been digging through rubble with their bare hands. But freezing conditions are hampering search efforts. . In the southern province of . , the Reuters news agency reported that a woman's voice was heard calling for help under a pile of rubble.. \"They're making noises, but nobody is coming,\" a resident who gave his name as Deniz said while weeping.. \"We're devastated, we're devastated. My God... They're calling out. They're saying, 'Save us,' but we can't save them. How are we going to save them? There has been nobody since the morning.\". In Hatay, Ghanaian footballer Christian Atsu - who made 107 appearances for Newcastle - . , his manager Mustafa Özat told Turkish radio.. Atsu now plays for Turkish club Hatayspor. The club's sporting director, Taner Savut, is still under the rubble, Mr Özat said.. In the Turkish city of . , near the epicentre, pouring rain hampered rescuers. The city was without power as the cold and rain set in.. One family camped on the street, scared of the aftershocks, despite the freezing temperatures. Every time they felt an aftershock, the family moved closer into the middle of the street.. A hotel owner in the city told the BBC that of 14 guests staying that night, only seven had been found.. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment.. But the earthquake has caused significant damage to three airports across Turkey, also creating challenges for aid deliveries.. This video can not be played. Diyarbakir, Turkey: 'People are still trapped under the rubble'. At least 1,600 people are now known to have been killed in Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on the Turkish border. . Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones. . In 1999 a quake killed more than 17,000 in the north-west, while in 1939, 33,000 people died in the eastern province of Erzincan.. This earthquake was powerful enough to be felt as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel.. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

        "content": "Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an . But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success.. The UK's .  said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation.. But the UK said \"it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks\".. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been \"liberated\" in recent weeks and operations were progressing \"with success\" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar.. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000. . Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward.. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. \"We are countering them,\" he said on Monday night.. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could \"prove themselves\" against current threats from Russia.. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation. . Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured .  north of Bakhmut after an intense battle.. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove.. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range.. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and \"could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation\".. ",

        "content": "Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year.. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a \"revenge killing\".. Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused.. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as \"low-risk\".. He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom.. \"From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,\" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency.. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities.. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them.. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims.. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases.. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament.. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker.. ",

        "content": "Our building is dangerous’: Quake leaves Syrians homeless. More than 1,600 people have been reported dead so far in northern Syria following the quake.. Emergency rescue teams said many buildings were damaged or destroyed and that people were trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there.. Much of Aleppo was destroyed in the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence. . While there have been efforts to rebuild the city - Syria's pre-war commercial hub - there is dilapidated infrastructure, plus destroyed buildings, and power outages are common.. According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,600 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said families remained trapped under the rubble. . One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP news agency he had lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble.. \"We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,\" he said. \" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery.\". In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region were beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.. Some people in remote areas of Syria are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies. . Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. .

The notice of claim was obtained by the Associated Press news agency through a public records request. . It outlines allegations of previous behavioural issues the child is said to have had at school, including cursing at staff and teachers, trying to whip students with his belt and choking a teacher. . The week of the shooting, the boy allegedly \"slammed\" Ms Zwerner's phone and broke it, according to the claim notice. . He was given a one-day suspension and shot Ms Zwerner in her classroom the day he returned to school. Police have described the shooting at \"intentional\". . Lawyers for Ms Zwerner have previously said that school leaders were warned three times that the boy might have a gun on the day of the shooting. . The boy's backpack was searched, but no gun was found. No further action was taken.. \"It is a miracle that more people were not harmed,\" lawyer Diane Toscano, wrote in the notice. . \"The shooter spent his entire recess with a gun in his pocket, a gun that was loaded and ready to fire ... while lots of first-grade students played.\". In a public statement last month, the child's family said the boy had an \"acute disability\". They said the boy took part in a care plan at the school related to his disability, which usually involved one of his parents attending school with him every day. He was unaccompanied for the first time the week of the shooting. . The school's superintendent lost his job amid the fallout from the incident and the assistant principal resigned. . The teacher involved in the alleged choking described in the claim confirmed the incident to the Associated Press but asked not to be named. She said in 2021, the boy came up behind her, locked his forearms around her neck and pulled her backwards. . She said she informed school administrators of the incident but did not receive the type of response she had hoped for.. The boy was later moved to another school.. ",

I will tell you that we did not detect those threats,\" he said.. A suspected Chinese spy balloon was shot down by the US military over the weekend after it spent days travelling through American airspace. .

The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week cancelling a planned trip to Beijing..
