        "content": "WATCH: Dashcam footage shows moment of new Turkey earthquake. Tremors of 6.4 and 5.8 magnitude struck in the south-east near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. .

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported that a larger group was initially kidnapped and some local guides have since been released.. The four people who remain captive are the professor, an archaeologist from an Australian university, and three university students from PNG.. The police chief said overnight the kidnappers were \"opportunists\" who had \"obviously not thought this situation through\".. \"We are offering the abductors a way out,\" he said.. \"They can release their captives and they will be treated fairly through the criminal justice system, but failure to comply and resisting arrest could cost these criminals their lives.\". PNG Prime Minister James Marape on Monday said authorities had been having \"running conversations\" with the kidnappers and he sought to reassure families of the hostages.. \"I'm confident, I'm optimistic, I'm prayerful that we get… them out,\" he said.. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is yet to comment.. Earlier this month a New Zealand pilot was taken hostage by separatist fighters in Indonesia's nearby Papua region. Philip Mehrtens will be held until demands for Papua's independence are met, the group say.. ",

He was initially lauded as the first openly gay Republican to win a seat in the House of Representatives as a non-incumbent when he won in New York's third district.. But within weeks, .  that called into question large portions of his CV, including his education and work experience, triggering a wave of further reporting.. He is alleged to have faced fraud charges in Brazil, presided over prolific campaign spending, lied about working for Goldman Sachs and about owning property - and even claimed to have produced the ill-fated Spider-Man musical on Broadway.. Speaking to Piers Morgan on Monday, Mr Santos said one of his \"biggest regrets in life\" was lying about obtaining a college education.. Asked why he had chosen to do so, Mr Santos said: \"Expectation on society, the pressure, couldn't afford it. . \"Decided I wanted to run for office, although I had built a very credible business career, but I just didn't have that part of my biography.\". \"I just went with it, if you are going to make up a lie, are you thinking at all?\" he added.. Mr Santos pointed out that he had run for the same Congressional seat in 2020 \"and I got away with it then\".. He reiterated his claim that he had never said he was Jewish, and repeated what he described as a \"party-favourite joke\" by describing himself as \"Jew-ish\".. Challenged over a claim that his mother was in the South Tower of the World Trade Centre in New York City on 9/11, Mr Santos said: \"That's true.\". \"I won't debate my mother's life as she's passed in [2016] and it's quite insensitive to try to rehash my mother's legacy,\" he said.. He added: \"She wasn't one to mislead me... I stay convinced that's the truth.\". The 34-year-old, who has faced calls from within his party to resign, was asked about the experience of the scrutiny he has come under.. \"It's uncomfortable,\" he said. \"I can't stand it and a lot of people think I love it, I just can't stand it... you need to learn how to deal with it and that's what I'm doing.\". Asked about an apology, Mr Santos said: \"I have looked inside a camera and said sorry... If you can ask for forgiveness, I think that is the first step.\". On whether he would have wanted to run for office knowing the pressure that would follow, Mr Santos said simply: \"Absolutely not.\".

        "content": " as \"unprecedented in modern times\".. They say previous presidential trips to wartime Iraq and Afghanistan had the back up of a heavy US military presence.. And despite widespread speculation among the press corps that Mr Biden might be planning a trip to Ukraine while he was in Poland, the visit still took everyone completely by surprise.. The sight of him appearing beside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the heart of Kyiv and under the sound of air raid sirens, makes a louder statement than anything he can say in a speech in Poland. . \"It was risky and should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that Joe Biden is a leader who takes commitment seriously,\" said White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.. Mr Biden had been scheduled to fly out from the US to Warsaw on Monday evening, for a two-day trip. . The advance schedule had two suspiciously lengthy gaps in his itinerary, and many wondered if that might be when he would slip into Ukraine. . Reporters at the daily White House press briefings have been repeatedly asking about a visit. We were told that there was no meeting scheduled with Mr Zelensky and no stops planned outside Warsaw \"right now\". . The final decision to make the trip to Kyiv was only taken on Friday, even though it had been planned for months with a handful of the presidents' top aides. . On Sunday, the official White House schedule still showed the president taking off for Warsaw at 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT) on Monday evening. In fact, Air Force One took off at 04:15 EST on Sunday morning. . On board was a deliberately small team of his closest aides, a medical team and security officers.. Only two journalists were allowed to travel with the president. They were sworn to secrecy and had their mobile phones taken away from them. They were not allowed to report the visit until after Mr Biden had arrived in Kyiv. . Russia was notified of the trip a few hours before Mr Biden's departure, according to the US national security adviser Jake Sullivan. . He said the US \"did so for deconfliction purposes… I won't get into how they responded or what the precise nature of our message was, but I can confirm we provided that notice\". . President Biden then spent 10 hours on a train to get to Kyiv. He could have visited other locations inside Ukraine that would have been easier to get to, but he wanted to make the symbolic trip to Kyiv itself. . While the president's trip is a signal to Moscow of the Biden administration's commitment to helping Ukraine, it is also a demonstration to US voters back home.. His press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was asked last week about polls that show American support Ukraine softening.. She answered that whenever the president speaks, he is talking to the American people as well as people around the world. Monday's message is designed to vividly counter the minority of Republican voices who question for how long the US can continue supporting Ukraine. . Meanwhile, the surprise visit has left reporters like me, who thought they were travelling with Mr Biden later on Monday, making the trip to Poland on an aircraft that will not be called Air Force One. . The world-famous call sign is only used when the president is on board.. ",
