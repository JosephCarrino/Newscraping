Abigail Zwerner, a 25-year-old teacher, was shot in the hand and chest, but survived.. On Wednesday, Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney Howard Gwynn told NBC News that his office would not seek charges against the boy.. He said the \"prospect that a six-year-old can stand trial is problematic\" because the child is too young to understand the legal system. . \"Our objective is not just to do something as quickly as possible,\" Mr Gwynn added. . \"Once we analyse all the facts, we will charge any person or persons that we believe we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt committed a crime.\". In a separate interview with a local ABC News outlet, Mr Gwynn said that the general consensus among US legal experts is that a six-year-old \"cannot form the requisite criminal intent to be guilty of an aggravated assault\".. Ms Zwerner is suing the school district after she was shot through her hand and upper chest following what police described as an \"altercation\" with the first-grader..

Gang violence and kidnappings in Haiti have risen sharply since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021.. The Caribbean nation has been facing a growing economic crisis. . The charity, commonly known by its French abbreviation MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières), made the move after heavily armed gangs expanded their territory to new areas in Port-au-Prince and nearby towns.. Several schools have also closed as kidnappings increase.. Earlier this year, an MSF-backed public hospital located south of the capital also closed after a patient was killed by a bullet as he left the emergency room.. Cité Soleil, an impoverished neighbourhood on the outskirts of Haiti's capital, now has just one private hospital and one other MSF operation, which is reducing operations.. Vincent Harris, a medical adviser for the aid group, said: \"We are living scenes of warfare just meters [yards] from the establishment.. \"Our hospital has not been directly targeted but we have been a collateral victim of the fighting since the hospital found itself on the frontline.\". Field communication manager Alexandre Marcou said a child who was on oxygen had died in a security room, where patients are sent for protection from gunfire around the building.. A 70-year-old man had also been found shot as he tried to cross the street to the hospital.. Haiti has been led by Prime Minister Ariel Henry since Moïse's death, but he has failed to rein in the gangs which control much of the capital.. Mr Henry has repeatedly called for the deployment of an international force to help police in their fight against the criminal gangs.. So far, no country has offered to lead such a force, while Mr Henry says it is key to providing security so that long-postponed elections can be held.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "The warming gas can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored safely and cheaply in seawater. . The new method could speed up the deployment of carbon removal technology, experts say.. While the world has struggled to limit and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in recent decades, several companies have instead focussed on developing technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.. Climeworks in Switzerland is perhaps the best known. Over the past ten years it has developed machines to suck in the air from the atmosphere that filter and trap the carbon dioxide molecules. . At a .  the captured CO2 is injected deep underground where it is permanently turned into stone. . The company has recently started selling a certified carbon removal service to large corporate clients including Microsoft, Spotify and Stripe.. However, one big problem for most current approaches to direct air capture is cost. . CO2, although a powerful warming agent, is relatively diluted in the atmosphere at around 400 parts per million (ppm) in air. . So big machines that require large amounts of energy are needed to both absorb and discharge the CO2. . This new approach, using off-the-shelf resins and other chemicals, promises far greater efficiency and lower cost, say the scientists involved.. The research team have borrowed an approach used for applications in water, and \"tweaked\" existing materials to remove CO2 from the air. . In tests, the new hybrid absorbing material was able to take in three times as much CO2 as existing substances.. \"To my knowledge, there is no absorbing material which even at 100,000 ppm, shows the capacity we get it in direct air capture of 400 ppm,\" said lead author Prof Arup SenGupta from Lehigh University in the US.. \"This simple ability to capture CO2 at a high quantity, in a small volume of material, is a unique aspect of our work.\" . The development, while in its early stages, has been welcomed by others in the field.. \"I am happy to see this paper in the published literature, it is very exciting, and it stands a good chance of transforming the CO2 capture efforts,\" said Prof Catherine Peters from Princeton University, an expert in geological engineering, who wasn't involved in the research project.. \"What is clever about this is that the starting point was a technology previously designed for applications in water. This advance applies this technology to the gas phase - a new idea.\". \"The demonstrated performance for CO2 capture is promising.\". One of the big challenges in capturing CO2 is what to do with the trapped gas. . Storing it under the ground or sea in former oil wells is one widely used approach. But the new paper suggests that with the addition of some chemicals the captured CO2 can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored simply and safely in sea water. . Dr SenGupta says he now wants to establish a spin-off company to develop the technology further. . He believes that removing CO2 in this way will not only be critical to limiting the rise in global temperatures but could also be directly empowering for developing countries. . \"We have to take it to places like Bangladesh, Barbados or the Maldives, they also have a role to play, they cannot be just bystanders who keep suffering.\". Some scientists are reluctant to put too much emphasis on new and emerging technologies like direct air capture because they fear that it could dilute the carbon cutting efforts of governments and individuals.. But with the temperature thresholds of the Paris climate agreement under threat from rising emissions, many others feel that the rapid deployment of direct air capture in addition to massive cuts in carbon is the best hope of avoiding dangerous climate change. . \"It has become even more important now that we are definitely in an overshoot regime, where we have to take carbon back from the environment,\" said Prof Klaus Lackner, a pioneer in the field of removing CO2.. \"DAC will have to get cheaper to make a useful contribution. I am optimistic that it can do this.\". Professor SenGupta shares that optimism, believing that this new approach can remove CO2 for less than $100 a tonne.. The research has been .  in the journal, Science Advances. . ",

It was valued at nearly $1.5m.. , 92.4% of home appraisers are white.. In 2021, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation released a study of 12 million appraisals over five years, showing that homes in black and Hispanic neighbourhoods were routinely undervalued.. Ms Tate-Austin and Mr Austin bought the house in 2016 in the San Francisco suburb of Marin City for about $550,000. . The city has a large African-American population (38%), compared with the predominantly white Marin County, where it is situated, in which only 2.8% of the population is black.. In 2020, when interest rates were historically low, the couple decided to refinance their mortgage.. The year before, a company had appraised their four-bedroom property for $1,450,000, after they made major improvements, including adding square-footage. . But when they decided to refinance again in 2020 to take advantage of low rates, they were appraised for just $995,000.. So they came up with an experiment. What if their friend, a white woman, posed as the homeowner instead? . They removed all trace of themselves from their home, including their African-themed artwork and their photographs. . The process is known as \"white-washing\", and black homeowners across the country have reported doing it in order to sell their properties.. Several weeks after their first estimate, a different appraiser toured the house for the decoy white homeowner. . This time, it was appraised at $1,482,500 - almost half a million dollars more than the initial estimate, . .. \"You feel a sense of relief like, 'I told you.' Then you just feel a sense of sadness,\" Ms Tate-Austin told the BBC's broadcast partner CBS News in 2021. . \"We had to do what we had to do in order to have our house appraised for what it should have appraised for from the start.. \"I mean, it's the financial impact, but it's the emotional impact. It's the feeling every day like, the tax of being African-American in this country, like you don't know, it's a coin toss.\" . The couple sued the first appraisal company for violating the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits housing discrimination.. The lawsuit was settled on Wednesday for an undisclosed amount. . As part of the agreement, the defendants do not have to admit any liability in the case, but will have to watch a documentary about discriminatory real estate and attend a training session on the history of racial discrimination in real estate..
