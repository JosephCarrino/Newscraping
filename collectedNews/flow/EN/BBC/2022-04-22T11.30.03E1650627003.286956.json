Shanghai city officials said all infected patients and close contacts will be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine. . In addition, disinfection measures will be escalated in some of the city's worst-hit areas. This will likely mean some residents will be forced to move out temporarily - including those who have tested negative.. The move comes days after people in two other Shanghai communities - Beicai and Pingwang - were ordered to leave their residences for temporary accommodations. . In Beicai, an official notice issued to residents told them to pack their belongings and leave their wardrobe doors open.. They were also told to leave open the front door of their home and their pets behind. Images on social media of people queuing with packed suitcases at night-time showed the scale of the operation.. As the vast lockdown approaches its fifth week authorities show no sign of easing up in their determination to maintain China's now battered \"zero Covid\" strategy. . In fact they're escalating. . In the worst hit areas, people's homes will be disinfected. This will likely mean some residents are forced to move out temporarily, even those who've tested negative. . We can make this assertion because earlier this week the BBC reported on the mass evacuation and forced removal of hundreds of people from their homes in at least two areas of the city, to allow for mass cleansing. . Shanghai city officials also re-iterated something that remains crucial - that all infected patients and close contacts should be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine centres. They want people discharged sooner, once they are negative. . But as the Party mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper said on its front page last week, \"persistence is victory\". . The latest measures signals the lengths to which Chinese authorities are willing to go to stop the spread of Covid in Shanghai - regarded as the country's financial and business hub. . Some in locked-down areas of the city have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. The lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies.. Officials are still trying to maintain the country's zero-Covid strategy which prioritises eliminating the virus over living with it as many countries have now chosen to do. . But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run.. The latest outbreak in Shanghai, first detected in late March, has seen more than 400,000 cases recorded so far and 36 deaths. Nearly all were elderly, unvaccinated residents with underlying health problems, according to Chinese officials. . As a result, the city's 25 million people have been ordered to stay home..

        "content": "Mr Putin told forces to abandon plans to storm the sprawling Azovstal steel works there, where Ukraine is still resisting the invaders.. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. Civilians as well as fighters are inside the plant.. Russian forces have been trying for weeks to dislodge them.. The BBC's Toby Luckhurst in Lviv, western Ukraine, has been reporting on . .. While Russia talks of isolating the Ukrainian defenders in Azovstal, they remain in contact with the outside world, describing conditions inside the huge steelworks.. Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Battalion in the complex, told the BBC military and civilians were hiding in several basements in the complex, some of which he and his comrades were unable to reach.. \"We know that there are small children there as young as three-months old,\" he said.. In recent days, Russian forces had used artillery and heavy bunker-busting bombs to try to destroy them, but all the attacks had failed, Capt Palamar said.. He added that more than 500 heavily wounded fighters needed medical help, and bodies of the dead remained unburied.. Read more from Capt Palamar's interview here.. The situation on the ground in Mariupol remains extremely difficult, with no further evacuations of civilians on Thursday.. Meanwhile a grim discovery has been made in a village some 20km (12 miles) outside the city.. US satellite firm Maxar says it has identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves in Manhush.. Local Ukrainian officials accuse the Russians of burying Mariupol civilians killed by Russian troops there, but Moscow has not yet responded to the allegations.. The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko says tens of thousands of civilians may have been killed in Mariupol.. Days ago we reported that two British men had been captured by Russian forces in Mariupol.. Both Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, have lived in Ukraine since 2018, and they had both been serving as marines in Ukraine's military since before Russia launched its invasion.. On Thursday . .. \"They are fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance. Just like other foreigners who have surrendered or been detained,\" said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.. Both have been shown on Russian TV, apparently with facial bruising, calling for a prisoner exchange. Their families have called for the Geneva Convention to be respected.. Images have been proliferating on social media of wreckage of Russian armour, apparently destroyed by Ukrainian forces.. One such image comes with a triumphant caption, saying a tank was destroyed by a Javelin missile.. The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, is among items sent to Ukraine through a series of military assistance packages from the US.. The latest $800m (Â£612.5m) package, announced by President Joe Biden on Thursday, also includes heavy artillery, howitzers and tactical drones to be used on the flat plains in eastern Ukraine. .

        "content": "Speaking from the Azovstal plant - the last part of Mariupol not under Russian control - Svyatoslav Palamar from the controversial Azov regiment said defenders had repelled waves of Russian attacks.. \"I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine,\" he said.. Earlier President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks - a maze of tunnels and workshops - and ordered his troops to seal it off instead.. \"Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot pass through,\" he said. . Much of Mariupol has been destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting. Taking the Sea of Azov port is a key Russian war aim and would release more troops to join a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. Capt Palamar said the Russians had fired on the steel plant from warships and dropped \"bunker-busting\" bombs on it. . The BBC has not been able to verify any of his account. But it tallies with testimony earlier this week from a . , who said fighters were outnumbered and running out of supplies.. \"All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings,\" Capt Palamar said.. The Azov regiment was originally a far-right neo-Nazi group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Its fighters along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers are the last Ukrainian defenders left in the city.. When asked how many Ukrainian defenders remained in Mariupol, Capt Palamar answered simply \"enough to repel attacks\".. He said that civilians were in separate locations away from fighters. They were in basements containing 80-100 people each but it was unclear how many civilians there were in total as some buildings had been destroyed and fighters could not reach them because of shelling. Entrances to some of the bunkers were blocked by heavy concrete slabs that only heavy machinery could move, he said.. \"We keep in touch with those civilians who stay in places that we can get to. We know that there are small children there as young as three months old,\" he said. . The fighter appealed for civilians to be given safe passage out of the steelworks and called for a third country or an international body to act as a guarantor for their safety.. \"These people have got through a lot already, through war crimes. They don't trust Russians, and they are scared,\" he said, adding that they feared torture and murder at the hands of Russian troops or deportation to Russia through so-called filtration camps.. Elderly civilians in the steelworks were in need of medicine while there were also about 500 seriously wounded fighters who were not getting the care they needed - including major surgery such as amputations.. \"After 52 days of blockade and heavy fighting we are running of medicines. And then we also keep unburied bodies of our fighters whom we need to bury with dignity in Ukraine-controlled territory,\" he said.. Capt Palamar said Ukrainian defenders also wanted to secure their own evacuation if possible - but there could be no question of surrender. . \"As for surrender in exchange for the safe way out for civilians, I hope we all know whom we are dealing with. We definitely know that all guarantees, all statements of the Russian Federation are worth nothing.\". He said many of the defenders left in Azovstal came from Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He himself had been married there and his child had been born there.. \"I witnessed how this city was developing. How this city became the pearl of Azov and it's a hometown for me as well,\" he said.. \"Russia is not renewing or rebuilding anything. It aims to destroy and terrorise... If we fall this horde will go further and the whole civilised world will be in danger.\" . Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing civilian shelters and of using weapons banned or restricted by international law - including phosphorus bombs and cluster munitions - in attacks on Azovstal. . Ukraine as well as the US and UK have announced investigations into the possible use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, something Russia has denied.
