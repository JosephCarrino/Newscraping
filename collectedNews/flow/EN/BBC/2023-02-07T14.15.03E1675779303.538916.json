        "content": "Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year.. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a \"revenge killing\".. Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused.. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as \"low-risk\".. He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom.. \"From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,\" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency.. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities.. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them.. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims.. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases.. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament.. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker.. ",

        "content": "A teenager was also killed in the attack. Police are still investigating the possible motive behind it. . A member of Mr Menéndez's party is expected to replace the murdered politician as mayor.. The municipal elections were held during an escalating crime wave linked to the growing influence of violent drug gangs in the Andean country. . Mr Menéndez was not the only politician to be killed in the run-up to the election. Two weeks earlier, the candidate for mayor of the coastal town of Salinas, Julio César Farachio, was also shot dead.. Police have arrested a suspect in Farachio's murder who had previously threatened the 45-year-old candidate. . The suspect had recently been released from prison after serving a sentence for drug trafficking, local media reported.. No arrests have been made so far in the fatal shooting of Omar Menéndez, whose assailants fled on a motorbike. . President Guillermo Lasso condemned the murders.. The president, a conservative banker, has been grappling with the rising number of homicides in Ecuador. . He has proposed a series of changes to the constitution which were put to voters on Sunday. . One of them was to allow Ecuadoreans with links to transnational organised crime to be extradited abroad if they are facing a trial in another country or have already been sentenced in absentia.. With many jails in Ecuador overwhelmed by the recent crime wave, some officials argue that extraditing convicted criminals to maximum security jails in the United States would be a safer and cheaper option for the Ecuadorean justice system.. Neighbouring Colombia amended its constitution in 1997 to this effect and has sent many a notorious drug lord to the US since. . Colombian officials say the vehemence with which the drug barons fight against their extradition suggests they see a sentence in a US jail - where they have no ties and no influence over guards and prison directors - as a particularly harsh punishment. . But the proposal to change Ecuador's constitution to allow for the extradition of Ecuadoreans narrowly failed, with 51% of voters rejecting it. . President Lasso said he accepted the result, saying that \"when the people speak, it's our duty to analyse, understand, and accept it\".. ",
