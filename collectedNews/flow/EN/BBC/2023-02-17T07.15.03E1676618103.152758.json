        "content": "Watch: Ohio man walks through new life after train derailment. It was that day that a toxin-laden train derailed just metres from their successful garbage truck business, which they'd grown from five customers to more than 7,000 over an 18-year period in and around this close-knit Ohio town. . \"It's totally wrecked our life,\" he told the BBC, choking back tears in the parking lot of his business, where the stench of chemicals and sulphur from the derailment remains powerful. . \"I'm at the point now where I want out of here,\" he added. \"We're going to relocate. We can't do it no more.\" . Mr Hamner's eyes are red and swollen, which he credits to the lingering physical impact of the chemicals spilled in East Palestine.. But he and his wife tell the BBC that their main wounds are unseen and psychological. . \"I'm losing so much sleep. I've already been to the doctor twice, and I'm taking anxiety pills,\" he said. . \"This is 10 times worst than just losing my livelihood. We built this business.\" . Like her husband, Mrs Hamner said she's spent sleepless nights worrying about their business, their 10 employees and the town where she's spent 20 years of her life. . Already, several dozen of their long-standing customers have cancelled their collection services and said they plan to leave East Palestine. . \"I'm afraid for the people that live here,\" she says. \"I don't know anybody who can sleep, because it's on so many fronts. It's your business, it's your health, and it's the health of your friends.\". Standing on a mound of dirt within sight of the charred remains of several railway cars from the derailment, Mr Hamner likened the incident to \"East Palestine's Chernobyl\", a reference to an April 1986 nuclear accident in then-Soviet Ukraine. . He's not alone. Over the course of two days in East Palestine, several residents told the BBC that they consider the derailment a seminal moment in the town's history. At least for the foreseeable future, their lives will be measured by what happened before the 3 February disaster and what took place after. . Federal and local officials have advised residents to drink bottled water. The authorities said it was safe for people to return to the town a couple days after the derailment, though environmental experts have voiced scepticism.. Sufficient exposure to the chemicals released in the crash - which include vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate  - can result in symptoms from nausea to cancer.. \"For this town, this is a Pearl Harbor, or a 9/11. One of those things that people always talk about,\" said coffee shop owner Ben Ratner. . In Mr Ratner's case, he said the stress and trauma has manifested itself in an \"interesting mix\" of emotions and sensations. . He now visibly bristles at the once-routine sound of trains passing by, adding that they seem louder and more abrasive than they had in the past. . He described friends in East Palestine as easily panicked now and constantly on alert, feelings that he compared to post-traumatic stress. . \"We need to start looking at the emotional and psychological long-term impact,\" he said. . \"People are concerned when they hear trains, or when they think of their kids going outside, or letting their dog outside and having it accidentally drink contaminated waterâ€¦ it's serious.\". Mr Ratner added that local children - after years of Covid-19 disruptions - now have to contend with another traumatic event upending their lives.. \"This thing could go on for generations,\" he said. \"It's a lot more than gasses and the big cloud and plume of chemicals. That stuff is serious, but there a lot of family and social things.\" . On Thursday, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Michael Regan, visited East Palestine to oversee recovery efforts, meet local officials and reassure residents that the government stands behind them. . \"We see you, we hear you, and we understand why there is anxiety,\" he said.. Additionally, both of Ohio's Senators - JD Vance and Sherrod Brown - offered messages of support for the community, while Ohio Governor Mike DeWine requested assistance from federal authorities.. In a letter, Alan Shaw, the CEO of Norfolk Southern - the company that operated the derailed train - acknowledged that residents are tired, worried and left with \"questions without answers\". . This video can not be played. Watch: Anger erupts at Ohio train crash town meeting. Some residents believe there is little that can be said to overcome the mistrust and anger that still hovers over the town. . Several reported that they had yet to hear from inspectors or officials nearly a fortnight after the derailment. . \"Nobody has been down to ask us anything. Nobody has checked anything. Nothing,\" said Kim Hancock, who lives just over one mile (1.6 km) from the derailment site. . \"How can they tell me that all is safe? There's no way,\" she said. . \"I'm not dumb. I watched the smoke cloud come over my house.\". ",

She was rushed to the hospital where the doctors carried out a Caesarean section to deliver her baby girl Loujain, meaning \"silver\" in Arabic. . But then came tragedy.. Hisham returned to rescue Faten's husband, and was shocked to see a nearby building had collapsed on top of their flats.. Faten's husband, 29-year-old Burhan Al Alimi, had died. His body was recovered three days later. He was in his final year of chemical engineering studies at Inonu University in Malatya.. Like any new mother, Faten is sleep deprived and trying to adjust to her newborn's feeding and sleep routines. . \"The beginning was very difficult, especially with the circumstances,\" she said.. Still, she is grateful. \"I thank everyone who helped me and stood with me,\" she said. \"I had a family when mine wasn't there.\". \"We imagined a beautiful life for our daughter,\" she added. \"But God's will is above everything, everywhere. No one knows where the end will be.\". Since Loujain's arrival, there has been an outpouring of love and support from fellow earthquake survivors in both Yemeni and Turkish communities. . Faten has moved in with a friend in Kocaeli, closer to Istanbul. And Yemen's ambassador to Turkey, Muhammad Tariq, has visited the baby. . Faten and her husband moved to Turkey after the .  in late 2014. . Since the .  began in March 2015, the Yemeni community in Turkey has increased to more than 20,000.. Yet even before the war, Yemenis were emigrating to Turkey for studies and work following the Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011. . Muhammad Amer, president of the Yemeni Students Union in Turkey, said there were now more than 8,000 Yemeni students in the country. . So far, he said eight Yemenis had been confirmed dead across Gaziantep, Hatay, Adiyaman, Diyarbakir, Malatya and Iskenderun.. Yemeni doctor Mohammed Al-Ara'awi, who arrived Turkey before the war, said he lost his wife, 16-year-old son and young daughter.. When the quake hit, he was in Adana city, but his family were in Hatay. After desperately trying to reach neighbours, he travelled to Hatay and was devastated to learn about his family trapped under the rubble. . \"Waiting on the rubble was like the Yemeni war that people lived through,\" he said from Istanbul. . Idris Aqlan, a 25-year-old student at Gaziantep University, was visiting Istanbul when the earthquake hit. He told the BBC that two Turkish friends died.. \"I lived through many difficult situations in Yemen because of the war, but this one was much more difficult,\" he said.. The sudden nature of the earthquake did not give people time to prepare, he explained. In war, he said, at least there is time to hide in cellars, in the desert, or in the mountains.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Zelensky says peace deal would 'leave Ukraine weaker as a state'. In a BBC interview to mark a year since Russia's full-scale invasion, he warned conceding land would mean Russia could \"keep coming back\", while Western weapons would bring peace closer. . Mr Zelensky also said a predicted spring offensive had already begun.. \"Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,\" he said. . He does, however, believe Ukraine's forces can keep resisting Russia's advance until they are able to launch a counter-offensive - although he repeated his calls for more military aid from the West.. \"Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands,\" Mr Zelensky told the BBC.. He met UK and EU leaders last week in a bid to bolster international support and to ask for modern arms to defend his country. When Ukraine's president asked for modern fighter jets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing is off the table\".. But Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated with the speed with which Western weapons have arrived. Deliveries of battle tanks - . , including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. President Zelensky also addressed .  to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a single Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. . \"I hope [Belarus] won't join [the war],\" he said. \"If it does, we will fight and we will survive.\" Allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack again would be a \"huge mistake\", he added.. This video can not be played. Watch: Zelensky warns Belarus against helping Russian offensive. Russian forces launched part of their full-scale invasion from Belarus 12 months ago. They drove south towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv but were fought back and made to retreat within weeks, after suffering heavy casualties.. When asked if he was surprised by Russia's tactics in the war, Mr Zelensky described them as \"valueless\".. \"The way they destroyed everything. If their soldiers received [and carried out] those orders, that means they share those same values.\".  suggested Russian troops in Ukraine were dying in greater numbers this month than at any time since the first week of their invasion. The figures cannot be verified, but the UK's Ministry of Defence said the trends were \"likely accurate\".. \"Today, our survival is our unity,\" said Mr Zelensky on how he thought the war will end. \"I believe Ukraine is fighting for its survival.\" His country was moving towards Europe economically, as well as through its values, he said.. \"We chose this path. We want security guarantees. Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state.\". \"It's not about compromise itself,\" he said. \"Why would we be afraid of that? We have millions of compromises in life every day.. \"The question is with whom? With Putin? No. Because there's no trust. Dialogue with him? No. Because there's no trust.\". ",

        "content": "Winds and warmer air and water reduced coverage to just 1.91 million square km (737,000 sq miles) on 13 February.. What is more, the melt still has some way to go this summer.. Last year, the previous record-breaking minimum of 1.92 million sq km (741,000 sq miles) wasn't reached until 25 February. . Three of the last record-breaking years for low sea-ice have happened in the past seven years: 2017, 2022 and now 2023.. Research, cruise and fishing vessels are all reporting a similar picture as they make passage around the continent: most sectors are virtually ice-free. . Only the Weddell Sea remains dominated by frozen floes.. Scientists consider the behaviour of Antarctic sea-ice to be a complicated phenomenon which cannot simply be ascribed to climate change. . Looking at the data from the last 40-odd years of available satellite data, the sea-ice extent shows great variability. A downward trend to smaller and smaller amounts of summer ice is only visible in the past few years.. Computer models had predicted that it would show long-term decline, much like we have seen in the Arctic, where summer sea-ice extent has been shrinking by 12-13% per decade as a result of global warming. . But the Antarctic hasn't behaved like that. . Data sources other than satellites allow us to look back at least as far as 1900.. These indicate Antarctic sea-ice was in a state of decline early in the last century, but then started to increase. . Recently it has shown great variability, with record satellite winter maximums and now record satellite summer minimums as well. . In winter, the floes can cover 18 million sq km (6.9 million sq miles), and more.. It's broadly what this year's summer ice pack is missing compared with the longer-term average. That's enough to cover the British isles.. It will start growing again very soon and it's important that it doesâ€¦ for a host of reasons. . Freezing seawater at the surface of the ocean expels salt, making the water below denser, causing it to sink. . This is part of the engine that drives the great ocean conveyor - the mass movement of water that helps regulate energy in the climate system. . Sea-ice is also hugely important for life at the poles. . In the Antarctic, the algae that cling to the ice are a source of food for the small crustaceans known as krill, which are a basic food resource for whales, seals, penguins and other birds. . The sea-ice is also a platform on which some species will haul out and rest.. It's likely this year's record sea-ice minimum has been influenced by the unusually high air temperatures to the west and east of the Antarctic Peninsula. . These have been 1.5C above the long-term average. . There's also something called the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which is a key player in the region. . It describes variations in atmospheric pressure around Antarctica which in turn influence the continent's famous encircling westerly winds. . The mode is said to be in a strongly positive phase at the moment. . This strengthens the prevailing westerlies and drags them poleward. . Increased storminess helps to break up floes and push them north into warmer waters to melt out. . Researchers think the more positive trends seen in the SAM over the longer term are probably linked to the presence of an ozone hole over Antarctica and the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.. It's important to understand the differences between the poles. . The Arctic is an ocean hemmed in by continents. The Antarctic is a continent surrounded by ocean. . The divergence in geography means ice growth in winter in the Antarctic is much less constrained. The floes can develop as far north as conditions will allow. . This explains the much larger extents than in the Arctic, where the maximums rarely now get above 15 million sq km (5.8 million sq miles). . But the geography also means summer warmth can chase the sea-ice all the way back to the Antarctic coastline in many places. . And because the Antarctic has difficulty retaining ice from year to year, its floes are thinner than in the Arctic - generally just one metre or less, versus 3-4m for long-lived ice in the polar north. .
