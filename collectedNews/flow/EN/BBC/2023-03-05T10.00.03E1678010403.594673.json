        "content": "In the past few weeks, accusations have flown between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova over alleged .  and warnings about the potential for conflict to erupt here again.. Moldova's prime minister, Dorin Recean, has said Russian troops should be expelled from the region, amid warnings from President Maia Sandu that Moscow is planning to topple her pro-western government.. Russia, meanwhile, has been talking up the threat of a \"false flag\" attack by Ukrainian forces - and warned that any attack on its troops in Transnistria would be seen as an attack on Russia itself.. Many western analysts point out that Transnistria could provide Russia with another entry point into Ukraine, forcing Ukrainian troops away from other areas of fighting.. So Transnistria - controlled by pro-Russian separatists since .  - is being closely watched globally, but also by those much closer to home.. The warnings and threats about fresh conflict here hang heavy over the village of Molovata Noua.. This is a tiny Moldovan enclave, jammed up against Transnistrian territory and separated from the rest of Moldova by the River Dneister.. If residents of Chisinau feel vulnerable, residents of Molovata Noua feel completely exposed.. Many of the older men here fought pro-Russian separatists for this land 30 years ago. They're wondering now if they'll have to fight here again.. On Friday, veterans of that conflict gathered in Molovata Noua for an annual pilgrimage across the line of control into Transnistria, to honour those who died.. Two dozen men in military fatigues, bright medals on their chests and darkness behind their eyes. Among them, 62-year-old Vlad Untila.. \"We're lucky that Ukraine is defending us at the moment,\" he said, \"but if it kicks off in Moldova, we're ready to defend this territory again.\". Their convoy of cars makes its way down the deserted dirt road from Molovata Noua into the breakaway pro-Russian territory - crossing into enemy territory as they did three decades ago.. \"See how they look at us,\" Vlad growls, as his car approaches the Russian checkpoint.  . A gaggle of armed soldiers eye the convoy, as it carries men in Moldovan military fatigues into separatist territory, turning a blind eye to this eye-catching annual ritual.. \"Look around you,\" Vlad says, \"this is where we fought - it was all a battlefield.\". Now the narrow dirt road cuts through the silent countryside, flanked by brown fields and broken winter trees.. \"It's hard because I feel I'm in my own country,\" his friend Constantin joins in. \"It's my own land, and yet I can't walk freely here.\". A short drive beyond the checkpoint, hidden in brambles by the side of the road, is the first stop on the pilgrimage - a simple blue cross made from metal poles.. It marks the spot, 31 years ago, where a local mayor was killed.  The veterans gather round with a garland of flowers and a plastic bottle full of wine, to toast their fallen comrades.. They follow the trail of pale blue monuments dotted through this territory, repeating the ritual at every stop, honouring their comrades, siblings, and friends.. \"We were both snipers,\" Vlad remembers, at the spot his friend Vasea was killed. \"They were shooting at us from that hill over there, from a tank. One of the shrapnel fragments hit him in the neck. He fell to the ground and died in my arms.\". As the veterans pass a local Moldovan school, pupils come out to greet them, led by their headmistress Tatiana Rosca.. \"There were big battles here in 1992,\" Tatiana says.  \"And there are still deep wounds in the souls of the people.  We're very afraid: we know what war means and we don't wish it on anyone.\". One of her pupils says she's ready to take up arms if conflict erupts again, as her father and grandfather did 30 years ago.. But loyalties here - as in the rest of Moldova - are complicated by history, geography and economics.  . Here on the other side of the River Dniester, the pull of Moldovan identity is set against the pull of subsidised Russian gas from Transnistria.. The economic gulf with the rest of the country has widened since the start of the war in Ukraine, after Moscow cut gas supplies to Moldova last year.. \"I'll be honest,\" the mayor of Molovata Noua, Oleg Gazea, told me. \"It's very difficult to convince people that life is better in Moldova when they pay a fraction of the price for gas here.\". \"We can't talk about freedom and a better life, and at the same time tell them to go across the river and pay 30 times more for their bills - they'll tell us: are you crazy? But there's a hidden price [to the cheap gas] - it buys their support.\". Some people here firmly believe that Moscow is not a military threat, but an economic ally - and that president Maia Sandu is the one provoking a war by moving closer to the West.. \"Transnistria is really sticking up for us,\" 59 year old Maria Ursachi tells me.  . \"But Moldova is a disappointment. People are afraid to come over the river to talk to us: they have a border control post there and they check our bags. Chisinau doesn't see us.\". Arriving back in Molovata Noua, the veterans end their pilgrimage in the village square by laying red carnations at a memorial to the frozen conflict here.. In the years since they fought the pro-Russian separatists, their children have grown up alongside Russian soldiers, Russian language and Russian economic support.. \"We older men will still form the heart of any resistance\", Vlad tells me, \"even with the involvement of younger men.\". Memories of the past, that linger in this tiny Moldovan enclave, are being sharpened by growing fears for the future. . ",

        "content": "The agreement was reached on Saturday evening, after 38 hours of talks, at UN headquarters in New York.. The negotiations had been held up for years over disagreements on funding and fishing rights.. The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 - the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.. That agreement established an area called the high seas - international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research - but only 1.2% of these waters are protected. . Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.. In the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, . These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. . Environmental groups .  that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.. The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".. Rena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.. Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.. Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. . Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. . Dr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.. He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that's our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\". Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\". \"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.. Countries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. . Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\". ",

This year, for the first time in the award's 37-year history, the best actor categories were all gender neutral.  . Minhaj began the night with an at times barbed roast of the nominees and the film industry. At one point, he embarrassed actress Cate Blanchett so much she crawled under the table.  . Actor Ke Huy Quan took home the first award of the night for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Everything Everywhere.   . Quan, who has spent much of his career working behind the scenes, used his speech to praise the often-unsung crewmembers, from the boom operators to stunt coordinators, who make films possible.  . Later, Michelle Yeoh won for Best Lead Performance in the film and Stephanie Hsu took off her shoes to run onstage and accept the award for Best Breakthrough Performance.  . It was also a big night for first-time nominees. Ayo Edebiri won Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series for her role in The Bear.   . Actor Sheryl Lee Ralph, who was also nominated in the same category, later reflected on her how she spent much of her early career begging Hollywood to diversify.  . \"I stand here tonight having lost best supporting actress in television to Ayo,\" Ms Ralph said. \"I have to honestly say that's what change looks like.\"  . By far one of the most compelling moments of the night was when filmmaker Reid Davenport won the \"Truer than Fiction\" Award. Davenport's film, I Didn't See You There, charts his everyday life as someone who navigates the world in a wheelchair due to his disability.  . \"There are so many disabled artists trying to get into this industry who are not given a chance,\" Mr Davenport said. \"I ask you humbly to let them in.

        "content": "Mr Marchenko said \"not a single building\" had remained untouched and that the city is \"almost destroyed\".. Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take charge.. \"There is fighting near the city and there are also street fights,\" Mr Marchenko said. . Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia. But despite that, the city's strategic value has been questioned. . Some experts say any Russian victory could be pyrrhic - that is, not worth the cost.. Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000. Ukrainian commanders estimate that Russia has lost seven times as many soldiers as they have.. On Saturday, .  Russian advances in the northern suburbs had left the Ukraine-held sections vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides. . Mr Marchenko accused the Russians of having \"no goal\" to save the city and that it wanted to commit \"genocide of the Ukrainian people\". . \"Currently there is no communication in the city so the city is cut out, the bridges are destroyed and the tactics the Russians are using is the tactic of parched land,\" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.. The fall of Bakhmut has long been predicted, but for more than six months it hasn't happened. So any reports of potential Ukrainian withdrawal should be treated with caution. . It is hard to know what is going on without independent sources. Both sides have a greater incentive to confuse their enemy than provide accurate information. . But it may be that Ukrainian commanders are beginning to calculate that the cost of defending Bakhmut - in terms of blood and treasure - is now too great, despite the grievous losses being inflicted on Russian troops. . And if so, then they might want what Western analysts call .  to protect the remaining Ukrainian forces so they can be redeployed. . But any withdrawal may be hard fought and could take some time. . Earlier this week, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the situation in the area was becoming \"more and more difficult\" - although the Ukrainian military . \"I believe we shouldn't give any inch of our land to the enemy,\" Mr Marchenko said. \"We should protect our land, we should protect our people and we should protect the businesses that are on this land.\". The city was \"almost destroyed\", with bridges ruined and communication cut off, Mr Marchenko added.. \"They want to destroy Bakhmut, they want to destroy the city like they did with Mariupol and Popasna,\" he said, referring to two cities in the east of Ukraine now under Russian control.. The Russian military laid siege to the south-eastern port city of Mariupol at the outset of the invasion and.  that killed thousands.. Russia claimed the .  about 10km (6.2 miles) from Bakhmut, in January following a long battle with the Ukrainian forces.. Soledar, too, was reportedly reduced to a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble by the time the Ukrainian army retreated.. On Friday, President Zelensky stressed that artillery and shells were needed to \"stop Russia\". . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country's latest package included high-precision Himars artillery rockets and howitzers \"which Ukraine is using so effectively\". . ",
