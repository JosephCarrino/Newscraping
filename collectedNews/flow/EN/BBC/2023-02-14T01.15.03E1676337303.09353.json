        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spox. The objects posed a threat to commercial flights and were downed in the \"best interests\" of the American people, spokesman John Kirby said.. The US is scrutinising its airspace more closely since the recent incursion of a suspected spy balloon from China.. Beijing has alleged that Washington is flying its own balloons over China.. China's foreign ministry said on Monday that the US had flown balloons into its airspace more than 10 times in the past year.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.. Speaking from the White House, Mr Kirby denied the allegation: \"We are not flying surveillance balloons over China. I'm not aware of any other craft we're flying into Chinese airspace.\". On 4 February, a high-altitude balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina after moving for days over the continental US.. US officials said it had originated in China and was used to monitor sensitive military sites, but China denied the object was used for spying and said it was a weather monitoring device that had blown astray.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Michigan - and the administration has been under pressure to identify the objects.. A Pentagon spokesman on Sunday appeared to suggest the US had not ruled out that the objects were of an extraterrestrial nature, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied this at Monday's press briefing.. \"There is no indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,\" she said. \"I wanted to be sure the American people knew that and it is important for us to say that from here.\". Mr Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, joined Ms Jean-Pierre at the briefing.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. There were differences between the alleged Chinese spy balloon and the three objects downed over the weekend, he said. The latter did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were taken down \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\".. Efforts are currently under way to collect debris from where the objects fell, but Mr Kirby noted the objects in Alaska and Canada were in remote terrain and would be difficult to find in winter weather conditions, while the object in Michigan, he said, lay in the deep waters of Lake Huron.. Officials have not yet been able to \"definitively assess\" these objects, but have not ruled out the possibility they were conducting surveillance, he said. . He accused Beijing of operating a \"balloon programme for intelligence collection\" that has ties to the Chinese military and was not detected during the Trump administration.. \"We detected it. We tracked it, and we have been carefully studying it to learn as much as we can,\" he said.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles) and that experts were analysing wind models from Sunday to try to narrow the search field. . Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) spokesman Sean McGillis said the search in the Yukon was \"treacherous\" as the debris was probably located in \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Mr McGillis added that there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote location. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost concurred that the three most recent objects to be shot down differed from the first balloon.. He said all three appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discover debris should contact the police directly.. ",

        "content": "And in a post on his Telegram channel, Mr Prigozhin calls the soldier, Dmitry Yakushchenko, \"a fine fellow\".. Wagner may have faked the earlier video. It appeared to show Yakushchenko being hit fatally with a sledgehammer.. Mr Prigozhin joked about that video in reply to an inquiry from Russian news outlet Ostorozhno Media about Yakushchenko's true fate.. \"Ksenia, don't treat everything so gloomily. The kids are having fun,\" the Wagner chief wrote enigmatically. . He said the case was not a one-off drama, but more like the hit Soviet-era TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, a thriller set in World War Two. \"You know, good always triumphs over evil,\" he added.. Yakushchenko's current circumstances are unclear - and there is no confirmation that he is still alive, despite Mr Prigozhin's message on Telegram. Yakushchenko may have returned to Wagner via a prisoner exchange, but that has not been confirmed. . In the first video on Monday, released on the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone, he admitted having fled to the Ukrainian side, before being kidnapped and ending up as a prisoner of Wagner.. The apparent sledgehammer \"execution\", filmed in a cellar, was presented as the \"trial of a traitor\". . It was similar to a brutal killing shown in a . , again involving a soldier accused of defecting to the Ukrainians.. Wagner calls itself a \"private military company\" (PMC) and has thousands of troops involved in heavy fighting in Ukraine.. It began operations in 2014 in Crimea and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of . In the second video on Monday, Yakushchenko said: \"In Wagner PMC, everyone has the right to correct their mistakes. . \"When I was captured, I said all sorts of garbage and I'm still ashamed, but it was the only way to survive. Upon return from captivity, I brought lots of valuable information that saved the lives of many guys, so I was forgiven, for which I am very grateful.\". Neither video indicated where or when the filming took place, nor was that clear from the accompanying text posts.. Grey Zone named the alleged \"traitor\" as Crimea-born Dmitry Yakushchenko, 44, who defected to Ukraine four days after becoming a Wagner fighter.. The first part of the video showed him in Ukrainian captivity - the BBC has established that the clip came from Ukrainian channel Espreso.TV. . In it, Yakushchenko suggested that Crimea might return to Ukraine's control in a couple of years.. According to the text, he had been jailed earlier for murder, but had seized the chance to fight for Wagner in order to leave jail. Wagner is known to have . The video then cuts to a shot of Yakushchenko sitting in a cellar with his head taped to construction debris set against a stone wall. . Another man is standing behind him holding a sledgehammer. A caption calls the scene \"trial for treachery\".. At the point where the first hammer blow is struck, the video goes blurred and Yakushchenko falls backwards. Further blows are struck, then a caption reads \"the court session is adjourned\".. The Grey Zone post makes a sarcastic comment about Yakushchenko's apparent death, referring back to Wagner's November \"execution\" of Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was also a former prison inmate. . \"Like his colleague Yevgeny Nuzhin earlier, he caught the same disease that makes you lose consciousness in Ukrainian cities, earlier in Kyiv, now in Dnipro, and then wake up in a basement at your last court session,\" the post said.. The shadowy mercenary group has adopted a more public profile since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago - even opening a big headquarters in St Petersburg. . Yevgeny Prigozhin, for years a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been nicknamed \"Putin's chef\" for providing catering services for the Russian elite and armed forces. . But he has given Wagner credit for the offensive on Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, .  and suggesting that his forces are more competent fighters.. ",

Her dad's response was: \"I'm ready for a nap.\". The viral video, which details Mr Richards' long journey to finishing the novel, Stone Maidens, has garnered more than 40 million views.. TikTok, a short-form video hosting platform, has helped fuel sales of hundreds of books in recent years, including through the hashtag #BookTok, which readers use to discuss their favourite authors and book picks. In 2021 alone, BookTok helped authors sell 20 million printed books, according to a New York Times report.. The news of his overnight fame has overwhelmed Mr Richards, who cried while reading the comments section of the TikTok post after his daughter told him it went viral.. His daughter cried, too, thanking fans for the purchases. \"Because of them, you're number one,\" she told her dad. . \"He doesn't even know what TikTok is,\" she added. . Mr Richards' daughter said her dad - who lives with his wife in Montpelier, Vermont - was content simply to have finished the novel, which was published in 2012, and tells the story of an FBI forensic anthropologist investigating a serial killer who strangles women and dumps their bodies in the ravines of southern Indiana. . The book may have been inspired by Mr Richards' previous work. He garnered true crime expertise while serving as a senior law clerk for an Indiana judge researching and writing drafts for published opinions, including one on the appeal of a serial killer sentenced to death, according to his Amazon biography. . Fans on TikTok were quick to praise the book, as well as its author's story. . \"I've never ordered something so fast in my life,\" one user said after seeing the heart-warming video. . After \"25 years of little hope\", Mr Richards' unexpected success should serve as a reminder to never give up, his daughter said in a later TikTok video. . \"These last couple of days... I can't understand it,\" Mr Richards said in the video, toasting the boost in sales with milkshakes. \"I feel so blessed.\". But Mr Richards is not taking too long a break to celebrate. He is now working on a sequel to the book, according to his Amazon biography. . ",

When he was brought into the intensive care unit, hypothermia had set in and his body temperature had dropped to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit).. Aras may have survived, but his seven-year-old sister Hiranur did not. Neither did his nine-year-old brother Alp. Nor his father. . Just one of so many families irrevocably broken by this disaster..

Although now 72, Mehmet tells us he will for the rest of his days look after Aras as if he were his own son. . \"The rescuers did so well to save him,\" he says, \"and by God's grace, they gave him back to us alive.\" . Aras winces a little as the doctor changes the bandage on his swollen left foot. He's making a good recovery. . Aras's mum also survived - but he hasn't seen her since their world imploded. She is being treated at another hospital in the city but is expected to recover.. It was in an intensive care unit set up by Israeli doctors where Aras's own life was saved. . But as we walked through the ward on Monday, it was not just a child with a remarkable story but also a 65-year-old man. .
