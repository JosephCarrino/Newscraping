        "content": "Watch: Anger erupts at Ohio train crash town meeting. Representatives of the Norfolk Southern railway company, whose train carrying the chemicals derailed 13 days ago causing a huge fire, cited security concerns when they pulled out. . After the derailment, emergency crews performed a controlled release of vinyl chloride from five railcars that were at risk of exploding. . Thick plumes of black smoke towered over the town, East Palestine, but crews monitoring the air quality sought to reassure locals that it was going as planned. . Despite those assurances from officials, many residents say they continued to be frightened of the potential harms, which they say had impacted humans and wildlife alike. . Thousands of dead fish have appeared in the creeks in the town, while people .  that their chickens had died suddenly, and that their pets had fallen ill. . Many have reported difficulties getting their water tested, fuelling mistrust at what they see as an ineffective and inadequate response to the crisis.. Even before the event began, the company's absence left many residents seething. . \"They have something to hide. You don't back out of questions if you know how to answer them,\" East Palestine resident Jaime Cozza said. \"It was like a bomb went through our town.\" . Under the banners and murals of a local high school gymnasium, hundreds of people bombarded officials with repeated - and occasionally profanity-laden - questions about air and water quality. . \"I'm just as frustrated. I live in the community, just like you,\" said East Palestine's Mayor Trent Conaway, exhaustion clearly visible on his face. \"I'm trying to get answers.\". Just hours before the meeting, Norfolk Southern announced that it would not attend.. In a statement, the company said it had become \"increasingly concerned about the growing physical threat\" to its employees because of the likelihood of \"outside parties\" participating. . Lifelong resident Chris Wallace - who remains unable to return to his house near a local creek - told the BBC that many townspeople had long been concerned about the speeds at which trains went through East Palestine, as well as the potential dangers of exhausted staff. . \"They should be here answering questions,\" he said. \"They've got a lot to hide. They don't want us to know anything. They bombed us.\" . The BBC has reached out to Norfolk Southern for comment. . This video can not be played. Watch: Train up in flames in controlled burn. On multiple occasions, officials at the meeting were forced to plead with local residents to be civil, with Mayor Conaway telling those in attendance that \"we're all adults here\".. Mr Wallace and Ms Cozza said they are banding together with other locals to bring in outside experts to examine soil and water and bring in an attorney to answer legal questions. . Inside the crowded gymnasium, officials - including US Congressman Bill Johnson - faced repeated questions about what many locals said they see as contradictory and confusing health guidance. . \"They kept saying it's fine to drink the water, but also to drink bottled water,\" said Scott McLear. \"That's not an answer. That's a contradiction, live for everyone to see.\" . In the days after the crash, some residents said they experienced headaches and nausea.. After monitoring the air quality, the Environmental Protection Agency said earlier in the week that it had not detected harmful levels of contaminants. It has also been monitoring the air inside hundreds of homes and said it found no chemicals.. While officials at the event acknowledged that the toxins from the derailment had been deadly to wildlife - particularly fish - the head of Ohio's Health Department, Bruce Vanderhoff, told the crowd that the concentrations of toxins in the air and in water supplies were far below that which could harm humans. . \"Why are people getting sick if there's nothing in the air or the water?,\" asked a woman from the bleachers, sparking applause throughout the gymnasium. . Congressman Johnson, for his part, provided what he termed a \"common sense\" perspective. . \"I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a chemist,\" he said. \"If you've got ailments and conditions that you did not have before 3 February, go to your doctor. Get that documented.\". On Thursday, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Michael Regan, is expected to travel to East Palestine to meet with local officials and assess the response to the derailment.. In a statement, the EPA said that he would discuss the agency's \"air monitoring and work to ensure the health and safety of the community.\" . But for some local residents, Mr Regan's visit is too little, too late. . \"I have absolutely no faith whatsoever,\" said a young man who asked only to be identified as Owen. \"The answers they are giving could be true. But they aren't delivering them in a way that's going to make anybody feel better.\" . ",

        "content": "Two police officers and a neighbour were killed when Nathaniel, Stacey and Gareth Train opened fire on a rural property in Queensland last December.. The trio were shot dead after a lengthy stand-off with police.. Police have been investigating whether the group - brothers Nathaniel and Gareth, and Stacey, who had at different times been married to each man - were linked to conspiracy theories.. Queensland Police Deputy Commissioner Tracey Lindford on Thursday said their investigation had found the Trains \"acted as an autonomous cell\" and \"executed a religiously-motivated terrorist attack\".. They subscribed to a Christian fundamentalist belief system known as \"pre-millennialism\", and had targeted police.. \"They did refer to police as monsters and demons - as evil.\". \"Christian extremist ideology has been linked to other attacks around the world, but this is the first time we've seen it appear in Australia,\" Ms Lindford said.. The attack was premeditated, she said, and investigators had found \"significant evidence\" of advance preparation and planning. . The property - owned by Gareth and Stacey - had been set up with camouflaged hideouts, barriers, dirt mounts, guns, knives, CCTV and mirrors on trees.. While there's \"no evidence\" that any one else in Australia participated or assisted in the attack, Ms Linford said the Trains have been linked to individuals in the United States. Police have shared information with investigators there.. \"They'll determine what investigations they might make as a result of that information,\" she said.. Police had travelled to the remote inland property - about 270km (168 miles) west of Brisbane - on 12 December to check on Nathaniel Train who had been reported missing in New South Wales.. Four officers were inundated with gunfire after leaving their cars and approaching the house, owned by Gareth and Stacey.. Two constables - Matthew Arnold, 26, and Rachel McCrow, 29 - were hit immediately, then reportedly shot again, execution style. Another officer was injured but escaped, while the fourth was terrorised by the shooters who lit fires to try and flush her out.. A neighbour, 58-year-old Alan Dare, who turned up at the property to help was fatally shot too.. Ms Lindford said there was \"not one catalyst\" for the trio's extremism.. But Nathaniel's 2021 heart attack \"was a profound moment for him and his belief in God\", she said. Gareth and Stacey losing their school jobs due to Covid-19 vaccine mandates also increased their anti-government views.. Ms Lindford said their mental health had also been considered by investigators, but ruled an unlikely factor.. \"We quite often do see in our terrorist investigations, people who are impacted by mental health because they are easily radicalised.\". \"When you've got three acting together, it's challenging to say that there's a mental health issue in this instance.\". The attack will be investigated during a coronial inquiry, which will make final determinations on the Trains' motive, the police commissioner added.. ",

        "content": "The crump of Ukrainian air defences could be heard in the distance as we were led into a basement, to be met with the sight of dozens of prisoners taking shelter from the Russian attack.. Prisoner exchanges have become a regular feature of this war and for Kyiv it is crucial that they continue. Ukraine said this month it had secured the release of 1,762 men and women so far in prisoner swaps. These are highly sensitive operations, often taking months to arrange.. Under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war must not be paraded or exposed to the public.. We were allowed to approach who we wanted and asked for their consent. But the guards were with us wherever we went and these men were unlikely to have been speaking freely.. Many hid their faces to further protect their identities.. Last November, .  by both sides, based on interviews with prisoners who spoke of cases of torture and ill-treatment.. Here the guards appeared keen to show they were treating the prisoners well.. One fighter said he had been working for a mercenary group. He had been brought to this facility three days earlier, after he was taken prisoner near the eastern town of Soledar, captured last month by Russian forces.. A handful stared on defiantly. We met the gaze of one prisoner who said he was captured in the Luhansk region on 29 December. . \"I hope I will be exchanged and that I won't have to go back into the army,\" he said.. \"What if you have no choice?\" I asked.. He paused for a second: \"I have some ideas. I could come back by surrendering voluntarily.\". Leaving the shelter it became clear that half the prisoners had been wounded. . Some had bandaged hands or feet. Others would move with a heavy limp.. One young man became emotional as he described how he had lost his leg in a grenade explosion.. As we approached the pulsing sound of a compression drill, a small production line came into view where prisoners of war were putting together outdoor furniture sets.. They worked, again with their heads down.. A local company had a contract with the facility, we were told, and that meant the inmates could make some money too, mostly to spend on cigarettes and sweets.. Most prisoners of war are compelled to have jobs like this. Apparently only Russian officers had a choice.. At lunchtime the prisoners were marched to a temporary canteen on the top floor. Through the window a Ukrainian flag flapped in the cold wind. . They ate quickly and in silence, but for the sound of eating. Then, table by table, in a moment of perfect choreography, they stood together and shouted in Ukrainian: \"Thank you for lunch!\" . Inmates here are made to watch TV in Ukrainian, including documentaries on Ukrainian history and the southern city of Mariupol, which was all but flattened by a Russian siege and bombardment that lasted for months.. Some of the Ukrainian soldiers who had defended Mariupol were part of the last exchange.. We asked one inmate whether he understood what he was watching. . \"More or less,\" he said. \"I find it educational.\" He was unlikely to have said anything unflattering.. It is quite possible that some of the Russians in the room could not understand the programme they were having to watch, and they may not have wanted to.. The prisoners are allowed one phone call every two weeks, according to the guards. For their families back in Russia these calls are often the first chance they have to find out their sons have been captured.. \"Where are you? I've asked half the city about you!\" one young man's mother could be heard over the phone.. \"Mum, wait. I'm in captivity, I can't say more.\" . \"With the bloody Ukrainians?\" she said, before breaking down in tears.. \"That's it, Mum. Quiet,\" he told her, as the guard stood over him. \"The most important thing is that I'm alive and healthy.\"  . Some of the prisoners' calls went unanswered, leaving them hoping for another chance on the phone - and a future prisoner swap.. ",

        "content": "But city officials say such spaces aren't necessary anymore and will be converted to family parking spots.. Critics say their removal is just the latest example of anti-feminist policies in South Korea.. Chung Eun-jung, 55, said she uses the female spaces whenever she can find one: \"I feel safer when I use them, that there are not so many dangerous people close by.\". \"When I get in the car, I always lock the door immediately,\" she said, adding that she was well aware of car park crimes, often reported in the news. . Her daughter said she was upset that her mother would feel less safe. . \"It seems strange that they would actively get rid of something that makes women feel safe,\" said 27-year-old Park Young-seo.. \"They're not that big of a deal. It is not like half the carpark is dedicated to women; it is only a few spots.\". In Seoul, which is South Korea's largest city, car parks with more than 30 spaces were required to allocate 10% to women - just under 2,000 of the 16,640 public parking spaces were reserved for women. . They tended to be near building entrances so women wouldn't have to walk through basements in the dark.. Government figures in 2021 showed more than two-thirds of violent crimes committed in the city's car parks were sexual crimes: rape, sexual assault and harassment.. But Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, who introduced the women-only spaces, is reversing his own policy. He has said it is time to \"consider families\".. The new family spots will be made available to pregnant women or people travelling with children. The city council confirmed that women would who did not meet these criteria would not be allowed to use them. . Such a move feeds into what critics say is a culture of anti-feminism that has characterised South Korean politics over the past few years. . Men in South Korea increasingly argue that polices designed to advantage women are discriminatory. . The current government has removed the term \"gender equality\" from its school ethics curriculum and is trying to close . Oh Kyung-jin from the Korean Women's Association is disappointed the spaces are being removed but is more concerned about the wider trend.. \"The government is trying to push ahead with anti-feminist policies, and now we can see these regressive policies feeding through into local governments,\" she said.. But male pilot Cho Young-jae thinks the women-only spaces need to go.. \"These spaces do discriminate against men\", the 34-year-old said. . \"Walking 100 metres more does not make you less safe and these days parking areas are covered in surveillance cameras.\" . The women-only car spaces, which were first introduced in Germany in the 1990s, have been controversial in South Korea. . As some are longer and wider, critics argued they reinforced the stereotype that women find it more difficult to park. The actual reason they are bigger is because it was assumed that women, who take on most of the childcare in South Korea, would appreciate the extra space to get their children in and out of the car.. The city government plans to start converting the spaces at the end of March.. ",

        "content": " which until now had not lost its power to inspire, to lift the spirits. . The astonishing saga of the Thai boys rescued from the cave in July 2018 was that rarest of things in the news business: a tale with an almost flawlessly happy ending.. When we first got news that a group of Thai footballers had gone missing, I had dashed with my colleagues up to Chiang Rai, and then to the entrance of the Tham Luang cave complex, carrying just three days of clothes. . In my haste I had assumed few people around the world would care for long. The boys would be found, or perhaps they never would. That would be that. It was quite a misjudgement, and in the mud-soaked conditions outside the cave, I would come to regret my packing decisions. . Five days later, with no indication that the boys were alive or where they might be, and Thai rescuers driven out of the cave by rising flood waters, I was interviewed by a Thai television team.  . I found I was too emotional to respond. The boys were more or less the same age as my two sons. Dom was just 12 days older than my eldest. Reporting about them day and night, seeing their bikes still chained to the railings by the cave, they had become very precious lives. . Against all the evidence, all of us hoped against hope that they might still be alive.. And then that astonishing moment, when British divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton found them, calling out in the dark, \"how many are you? Thirteen? Brilliant\". It seemed nothing less than a miracle. . The journalists at the cave site multiplied quickly, far more than it could accommodate. But we knew getting the boys out would be difficult. So difficult, in fact, that the divers had told the Thai government getting even half of them out alive should be considered a success. . By now they were the most famous boys in the world. All of Thailand was rooting for them. For days the Thai authorities had pushed for a zero-risk option - leaving the boys there until the monsoon rains stopped four months later, even though they were warned this was a near-certain death sentence. Their lives had become too precious.. And when they eventually went for the high-risk, improvised rescue plan, and we watched the boys and their coach being brought out, heavily sedated, one by one over three days, it seemed impossible they had all survived.. But they did. And within days they were charming the world in their first appearance before the media, smiling, joking, knocking footballs around. . The Thai government took control at that point, leading the lucrative negotiations with Hollywood filmmakers and organising overseas trips. Yet none of that ever spoiled them.. They remained small-town boys with a few big dreams - polite, grateful for the effort so many had made to save them, and for the new opportunities their story had brought them to travel and study, but always refreshingly down-to-earth. Even the fear that fame would inevitably tarnish the fairy tale proved unfounded.. When he won the scholarship to go to Britain last year, Dom thanked Zico, the former Thai national team captain who had arranged it, and promised to study hard there. . \"I will do my level best,\" he wrote. No-one who watched him and his team-mates dealing so modestly with all the attention that came their way can doubt that he would have lived up to that promise.. This video can not be played. How the Thai cave boys were rescued. ",
