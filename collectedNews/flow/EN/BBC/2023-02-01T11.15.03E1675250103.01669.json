        "content": "A huge search was triggered when the object was lost while being transported along a 1,400km (870 mile) route across the state. . Authorities released a close-up picture of the pea-sized capsule - which could cause serious harm if handled - on the ground among tiny pebbles.. A unique serial number enabled them to verify they had found the capsule they were searching for.. Mining giant Rio Tinto apologised for losing the device, which is 6mm (0.24 inches) in diameter and 8mm long.. It contains a small quantity of Caesium-137, which could cause skin damage, burns or radiation sickness.. Emergency services used specialised equipment including radiation detectors during their hunt. . Announcing their find on Wednesday, the state emergency services paid tribute to \"inter-agency teamwork in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds\".. The capsule was found when a vehicle equipped with specialist equipment, which was travelling at 70 km/h, detected radiation, officials said.. Portable detection equipment was then used to locate the capsule, which was found about 2 metres from the side of the road, they added.. A 20m (66ft) \"hot zone\" has been established around the capsule and it will be placed into a lead container.. It will be stored at a secure location in Newman overnight before being transported to a secure facility in the city of Perth on Thursday.. The device is part of a density gauge, which was being used at Rio Tinto's Gudai-Darri mine in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia. The company had earlier promised to launch an investigation into what had happened. . Australian authorities have promised a review of existing laws on the matter.  . Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Perth that the current fine for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is \"ridiculously low\".  It currently stands at A$1,000 and A$50 for every day that the offence continues.. Exposure to trace quantities of the metal is like \"receiving 10 X-rays in an hour, just to put it in context, and... the amount of natural radiation we would receive in a year, just by walking around,\" said Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew Robertson earlier this week.. It was thought that the capsule may have gone missing up to two weeks ago.. The search area for the lost capsule was huge. It is roughly equivalent to the distance by road from John O'Groats in Caithness to Land's End in Cornwall, or from Washington DC to Orlando, Florida.. The state's desert is remote and one of the least populated places in the country. Only one in five of Western Australia's population lives outside of Perth, the state's capital.. The gauge was being transported by a subcontracted company, which picked it up from the mine site on 12 January to move it to a storage facility in the north-east suburbs of Perth.. When it was unpacked for inspection on 25 January the gauge was found broken apart and the radioactive capsule was gone. One of four mounting bolts and screws were also missing.. Authorities said vibrations during transit may have caused the bolts to become loose, allowing the capsule to fall through gaps in the casing and truck.. This incident came as Rio Tinto tries to repair its reputation in Australia.. In 2020, .  in Western Australia to expand an iron ore mine, sparking a major outcry that led to several of the company's top bosses standing down.. And last year, . , after an internal review at Rio Tinto found more than 20 women had reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over five years.. ",

        "content": "The call came as the UK, US, Canada and Australia announced fresh sanctions against army-linked firms.. The military has said the country is facing \"unusual circumstances\" - prompting fresh doubt over its pledge to hold an election this year. . Tayzar San, a prominent activist, said in a Facebook post that the strike was being conducted to provide proof that the \"public does not accept... the rigged election\" that the military was planning. . Images showed deserted streets in major cities, including the commercial centre of Yangon. . Two years after a coup which catastrophically misread the public mood in Myanmar, the statistics tell their own, dismal story. . More than 2,900 people have been killed during the junta's crackdown on dissent, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.. One-and-a-half million people have been displaced, 40,000 homes have been burned down, eight million children are no longer in school, and 15 million people are judged by the UN to be dangerously short of food. . Much of the country is caught up in a brutal civil war. Yet the military is still refusing to negotiate with its opponents, as it promised to do in a meeting with neighbouring countries shortly after the coup. . Instead, it has plans for an election which would almost certainly exclude Aung San Suu Kyi, who resoundingly won the last election, and much of her party, the National League for Democracy. . Those loyal to her are calling on citizens to boycott any poll organised by the military, arguing it would be illegitimate and impractical. The UN says these would be \"sham elections\". . The military's acknowledgement this week that it had failed to normalise the situation may force it to postpone the election - originally scheduled for August this year - and extend the state of emergency, prolonging the grim stalemate in which Myanmar is trapped.. Western nations used Wednesday's anniversary to coordinate new rounds of sanctions against the military and its supporters. . The UK targeted, among others, companies supplying aviation fuel to the military, which it said were \"enabling its barbaric air-raiding campaign in an attempt to maintain power\".. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the sanctions were aimed at \"reducing the military's access to finance, fuel, arms and equipment\". . He added: \"The junta must be held to account for their brutal crackdown on opposition voices, terrorising air raids and brazen human rights violations.\" . Australia announced its first sanctions against the military, aimed at 16 individuals \"responsible for egregious human rights abuses\", as well as two major military-controlled conglomerates, which dominate the country's economy.  . Sanctions by the US targeted the military-approved election commission, which \"the regime has deployed to advance its plans for deeply flawed elections\". . The military is expected to issue a statement on Wednesday that could extend a state of emergency. . ",

        "content": "In his first broadcast interview with the international media since his election, Gen Pavel gave a robust defence of Western military support to Kyiv, saying there should be \"almost no limits\" to what countries should send.  . Speaking from the renaissance Hrzansky Palace, a few hundred metres from Prague Castle, he said for him sending Western fighter planes such as F-16s was \"not taboo\", but he was unsure they could be delivered in a timeframe that could prove useful to Kyiv. .  this week, although France's Emmanuel Macron has said nothing is excluded.. \"I am proud of my country being one of the first to provide Ukraine with significant military help,\" he told the BBC.  . The Czech Republic was the first Western country to send tanks and infantry fighting vehicles - Soviet-designed T72s and BMP1s - to Kyiv, part of a series of deliveries of heavy weapons that reportedly began as early as March 2022. . Almost a year on, after much agonising and soul-searching, countries including the UK, the United States and Germany have begun answering Kyiv's repeated calls to send modern, Western-made tanks such as Leopard 2s, Challenger 2s and M1 Abrams.  . \"Probably very few people could imagine that Western countries would be willing to provide Ukraine with modern main battle tanks or long-range artillery or anti-aircraft systems,\" he went on. . Now, he said, it was reality.  . \"But at the same time we see it's still not enough\" to counter Russia's significant resources of men and materiel, he added. . He acknowledged Kyiv's disappointment at the speed of deliveries, especially Western tanks, which were explicitly designed to punch holes - literally and figuratively - through Soviet armoured formations. . Ukraine has asked for 300 such tanks and says the West has so far promised to send at least 120. But Gen Pavel said he hoped that would speed up - especially if Russia launches its anticipated spring offensive.  . The president-elect brushed aside the view - long held in some European capitals, especially Berlin - that such deliveries could be seen as \"escalation\". . Russia has warned that increased supplies of Western weapons will lead to Nato countries increasingly becoming directly involved in the conflict.. \"We have no alternative,\" he said. \"If we leave Ukraine without assistance, they would most probably lose this war. And if they lose - we all lose.\" . President-elect Pavel also said that he and other European leaders had a duty to explain to their sceptical - and in many cases frightened populations - of the sense in helping Ukraine. . \"Our cities are not being destroyed by Russian artillery and missiles. But our future could be destroyed if we don't support Ukraine to a successful end to this conflict.\" . And he also dismissed claims - among them from the man who stood against him this weekend, former Prime Minister Andrej Babis - that he was closing the door to diplomacy. . \"Once there is even the slightest chance of peace talks, let's support it. But there are no signs of it from the Russian side,\" said Mr Pavel, who was often portrayed as a warmonger during the campaign. . \"What needs to be said is this: the end of war is entirely in Russian hands. It would take only one decision from President Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine and the war is over.\" . And once it was over, he told the BBC, he could see a clear place for Ukraine in Nato. . \"The Ukrainian military will be probably the most experienced military in Europe. Ukraine deserves to be part of a community of democratic countries.\"    . Including Nato? I asked. . \"I believe they really deserve it.\" . ",
