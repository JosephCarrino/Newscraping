Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak.. The .  features audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading.. \"This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,\" another man says.. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat.. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites.. It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown.. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures include .  to prevent those with the virus from leaving and . .. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that \"even the ceiling isn't finished yet\" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into.. \"Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,\" she said.. Other residents shout out \"thank you, big whites!\" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules.. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators.. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: \"The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!\" . \"Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,\" another commentator wrote.. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city.. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free.. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged..

The Kazu 1 is believed to have been on a three-hour sightseeing voyage around the Shiretoko Peninsula.. The area is a designated UNESCO world heritage site, and boat trips are popular with tourists hoping to spot whales and sea lions as well as brown bears on the rocky beaches.. The crew managed to signal that the vessel was tipping at a 30-degree angle and starting to sink, according to Japanese media.. Patrol boats and police and military aircraft were immediately dispatched to find the vessel. Local fishing boats were also taking part in the search operation.. Of the 26 on board, two were crew and two were children.. Earlier reports suggested that several people were pulled out of the waters - but it is unclear if they are among the confirmed 10 victims.. Waves in the area had been high and local fishing boats had apparently decided to return to port by mid-morning. . The crew reportedly said that all those on board were wearing life jackets. .

For weeks Shanghai's 25 million-strong population has been shut in their homes while officials try to contain the city's worst Covid surge to date.. Images of workers in white hazmat suits sealing entrances to the city's housing blocks and closing off streets with green fencing have spread in recent days on Chinese social media.. Many of the fences, which are around two-metres tall, were installed around buildings designated as \"sealed areas\" where at least one person has tested positive for Covid-19.. Everyone living inside a \"sealed area\" is forbidden from setting foot outside their homes whether or not they have the virus.. It was not immediately clear why officials have began constructing the fences.. A notice dated 23 April from one local authority being shared online said it was imposing \"hard quarantine\" in some areas.. The BBC has not been able to verify these images but has spoken to a foreign national living in Shanghai who said green fencing appeared in his own residential complex three days ago.. The resident, who asked not to be identified, said that the main gate to his compound was chained up three weeks ago after he believes one of his neighbours tested positive for the virus.. But on Thursday he said workers installed a new barrier without any warning. . \"There is a long corridor in our compound, and within the long corridor they put up another green fence three days ago,\" he described on the phone. \"No one told us the reason it was installed.\". \"No one can get out,\" he said. \"I feel helpless. You don't know when the lockdown is going to end.\". \"If your area gets fenced off, what if a fire breaks out? I don't think anyone in their right mind can seal people's homes,\" he said.. While some city officials have been installing fences, others have been busy trying to block a popular video . .. The six-minute montage features unverified audio clips of the local population criticising inadequate food supplies and complaining about medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading in the video.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai say they have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs..

Shanghai officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine..
