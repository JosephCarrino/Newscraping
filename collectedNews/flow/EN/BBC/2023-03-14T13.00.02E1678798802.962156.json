        "content": "The Bank of Japan provided further help to keep financial markets stable after its leading stock index fell 2.1%.. But fears continue that other banks may be vulnerable while the path for interest rates now appears uncertain.. In Japan, major lenders such as the country's largest bank MUFG, saw their share prices tumble by more than 8% on Tuesday. An index of Japanese banking stocks, known as the Topix Banks Index, plunged by 7.4%, despite reassurances from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). . \"Japanese financial institutions' direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,\" said a BoJ official. . The European Stoxx banking index was down 0.75% on Tuesday morning. But that was an improvement from the 6.7% drop seen on Monday. . In the UK, financial stocks - which saw sharp falls on Monday - also continued to slide. Banking group Standard Chartered dropped 1.6% and HSBC fell 1.1%.. SVB was taken over by US regulators at the weekend after a surprise sale of some of its assets known as bonds last Wednesday sparked a run on the bank. . By the end of Thursday, customers of the bank - mainly in the technology sector - . .. New York-based Signature Bank, which focuses on the cryptocurrency industry, also collapsed at the weekend, Meanwhile, HSBC rescued SVB's UK business for Â£1.. A key issue for SVB is that it invested billions of dollars in government bonds at a time when interest rates were far lower. Since then, central banks have been raising interest rates to help calm rising prices, which is otherwise known as inflation.. However, this has left banks such as SVB sitting on huge losses. Last week, it reported a $1.8bn loss after selling a big chunk of bonds.. There is now speculation that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will curb an interest rate rise next week to quell turmoil in the banking sector. . Later on Tuesday, new figures on US inflation will be released which could also influence the pace of any US interest rate changes.   . Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, said that while banking stocks have been falling, SVB's problems are not emblematic of wider problems in the industry. \"It's a localised difficulty,\" he said. \"This feels like a crisis of confidence over concerns about the funding models of certain sectors, and specifically in this case, the tech sector.\". Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"I think SVB was a badly-run bank that took too much risk in one sector and was caught out by higher interest rates which if managed properly it would not have been.. \"But higher interest rates will bring more challenges to banks, the economy and start-up firms for sure.\".

Lavigne tried to finish her speech before confronting the woman.. \"Get the [expletive] off,\" she said and swatted at her breast, . . The woman was then escorted off stage by a security guard.. The pop-rocker alluded to the intruder in her later acceptance speech.. \"Now, nobody try anything this time. I'll [mess a woman] up,\" joked Lavigne, while collecting the TikTok Juno fan choice award.. The ceremony's host, Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu praised Lavigne, who is from Ontario, for \"handling that topless lady like a champion\".. In November, the Ontario government issued new regulations to remove 7,400 acres of protected Greenbelt land and open it up for housing, with 50,000 new homes set to be built by 2025.. The move, which has been criticised by environmental groups, is under investigation by the province's auditor general and integrity commissioner.. Elsewhere on the night, Toronto singer The Weeknd became the Juno's second most-honoured artist of all time.. The star won album of the year for Dawn FM - a concept record set in purgatory - earning him his 22nd Juno award, overtaking Celine Dion and Bryan Adams.. Only country-pop singer Anne Murray has more, with 24. . The musician, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, did not attend the event, and his absence reportedly prompted jeers from the crowd at the Rogers Place venue in Edmonton, Alberta.. Meanwhile, rock band Nickelback, whose lead singer Chad Kroeger used to be married to Lavigne, were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the event.. \"Twenty seven years, blood sweat and tears, started off 300 kilometres southeast of here in a little town called Hanna,\" said Kroeger, referencing the band's hometown.. \"We had no idea what we were doing and most of the time still don't,\" he added. \"But everything we did wound up leading us to this moment right here. But we didn't make it here without a lot of help.\". They then closed the show by performing their hits Rockstar, How You Remind Me and Animals.. ",

The government has declared a state of disaster in 10 districts that have been hardest-hit by the storm. . Rescue workers are overwhelmed, and are using shovels to try to find survivors buried in mud. . \"We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,\" police spokesman Peter Kalaya told the BBC.. The death toll is expected to rise as some areas remain cut off because of relentless rain and fierce wind.. Officials at the main referral hospital in Blantyre said they could not cope with the sheer number of bodies that they were receiving.. They appealed to bereaved families to collect the corpses for burial as the hospital's mortuary was running out of space.. The storm has also crippled Malawi's power supply, with most parts of the country experiencing prolonged blackouts.. The national electricity company said it was unable to get its hydro-power plant working as it had been filled with debris.  . Densely-populated poorer communities, living in brick and mud houses, have been hardest-hit. . Some of these houses have crumbled into flood waters, while others have been entirely swept away.  . The UN and other agencies have warned that the timing of the storm could exacerbate a cholera outbreak - one of Malawi's worst public health crises. . The government has appealed for help for the tens of thousands of people who have been left without food and shelter.. Freddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the longest-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization. . On Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone - for the second time in a less than a month - after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.. It has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths, as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas. . About 10 deaths have so far been reported.. Experts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.. Freddy had broken records for the strength it accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.. ",

        "content": "Joe Biden: \"Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs\". Under the Aukus pact Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs - at least three - from the US.. The allies will also work to create a new fleet using cutting-edge tech, including UK-made Rolls-Royce reactors.. Beijing has strongly criticised the significant naval deal.. Its foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the three nations of \"walking further and further down the path of error and danger\".. China's UN mission had earlier also accused the Western allies of setting back nuclear non-proliferation efforts.. But US President Joe Biden said the deal was aimed at bolstering peace in the region and stressed the submarines would be \"nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed\". . Speaking alongside the UK and Australian prime ministers - Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese - in San Diego, California, Mr Biden said the deal would not jeopardise Australia's commitment to being a nuclear-free country. . For Australia, it is a major upgrade to the US ally's military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology. . The submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. . Under the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.. From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more. . After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS. . This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.. President Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open. . \"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.. He also pledged of $4.6bn (Â£3.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.. Australia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (Â£201bn) over 30 years - marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".. Anthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs. The UK PM also said thousands of jobs would be created in Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, where some of the construction would take place.. Mr Sunak said that in the 18 months since the Aukus alliance was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown. . \"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division,\" Mr Sunak said.. As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also .  over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states.. The Aukus security alliance - announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing's foreign ministry last week reiterated its position that the pact risked creating an arms race.. But the three Western countries say the security deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific. . While all three leaders have stressed how the deal will strengthen their co-operation, it hasn't been without its political fallout.. In 2021, Australia .  in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris. . Australia also faces a delicate diplomatic situation with China - its largest trading partner. Analysts say the question will be whether it can continue to strengthen its military ties with US, while fostering commercial ties with Beijing.. ",
