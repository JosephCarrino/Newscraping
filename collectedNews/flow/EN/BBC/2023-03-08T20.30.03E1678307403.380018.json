        "content": "The Department of Justice said it would examine \"certain policies and practices of the Memphis Police Department\".. The review was requested by Memphis' police chief in the wake of Mr Nichols' death.. It will investigate the department's training, data and processes related to use of force, de-escalation and special police units, like the one involved in stopping Mr Nichols before his death.. \"In the wake of Tyre Nichols's tragic death, the Justice Department has heard from police chiefs across the country who are assessing the use of specialised units and, where used, appropriate management, oversight, and accountability for such units,\" Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said.. Mr Nichols' death sparked nationwide protests against police brutality in the US. The Justice Department has already launched a civil rights investigation.. The agency said it would share its findings and issue recommendations after the review is complete. . Separately, the Memphis Police Department was set to release 20 more hours of video footage and audio of the violent 7 January traffic stop that proceeded Mr Nichols' death, before a Memphis judge blocked the move Wednesday afternoon. . Shelby County Criminal Court Judge James Jones Jr ruled the footage could not be shared until the five Memphis police officers charged with Mr Nichols' murder have had a chance to review it. . Another review focused exclusively on the role of special police units within law enforcement will also be launched.. Special police units - which are common across the country and often used to crack down on street crime - have been criticised since Mr Nichols' death. . Five black members of Memphis's Scorpion Unit - which stood for \"Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\" - face second-degree murder and other charges for the killing of Mr Nichols. . The 50-person unit, which had been accused on several other occasions of misconduct, has since been disbanded.. Previous body-camera footage of the Scorpion members' encounter with Mr Nichols released in January showed police officers kicking, punching and firing a Taser at Mr Nichols for several minutes as he cried out for his mother.. Police initially said Mr Nichols, a father-of-one who had been returning home, was stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, a claim that has not been substantiated, according to Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis. . Seven police officers have so far been fired, while at least 13 officers in total are facing some form of discipline over the incident, according to Memphis chief legal officer Jennifer Sink.. Three emergency medical workers have also been fired for not providing Mr Nichols with adequate care.. The city plans to share information on the charges and disciplinary action city officials are facing as a result of the investigation along with the 20 hours of footage, Ms Sink said this week. . ",

        "content": "Mr Roldugin reportedly placed $50m (£42m) in Swiss accounts between 2014 and 2016, with no credible explanation of where the money had come from.. At the time, he presented himself as a cellist on a modest income.. He had become famous as a musician but did not earn vast sums. He once told the New York Times he was no businessman, and certainly not a millionaire.. So where did he get millions of dollars to put into Swiss bank accounts? . This is the question Zurich prosecutors say the accused former bankers should have asked. It was well known the cellist was a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is even rumoured to be godfather to Mr Putin's daughter.. Under Swiss law, banks are required to reject or close accounts if they have doubts about the account holder, or the source of the money. . They are also supposed to handle \"politically exposed persons\" with extreme care. As a known friend to the Russian leader, investing millions in Switzerland after the illegal annexation of Crimea and subsequent sanctions against Russia in 2014, Sergei Roldugin should have rung alarm bells. Prosecutors will allege that did not happen.. The case is being seen as a test of how rigorously Switzerland enforces its money laundering laws, which, on paper at least, are quite strict. . Swiss authorities have worked hard in recent years to move away from the image of Switzerland as a country in which even the dirtiest money from the most brutalist dictator or most corrupt businessman can be washed whiter than white. . Mr Roldugin's questionable money was first revealed, not by Swiss investigators, but by journalists, including a team from BBC Panorama, involved in an international investigation of the Panama Papers data leak organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2016.. They discovered evidence of suspicious transactions involving Mr Roldugin's offshore companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as his Swiss bank accounts.. Only after that evidence appeared did Swiss prosecutors launch their own investigation. Their indictment, now before the court in Zurich, suggests the musician was acting as \"Putin's wallet\", channelling funds via bogus companies in Cyprus and Panama into Gazprombank in Zurich. . The four accused are charged with failing the \"due diligence\" test, in not checking - or turning a blind eye to - the real source of his money. . They have all pleaded not guilty. Their defence lawyers argued that the prosecution has been unable to prove the money invested did not belong to the cellist. The fact he was known to be a friend of Vladimir Putin's was a good reason for not asking him about the source of his funds, as his wealth would not be a surprise.. Gazprombank has since wound up its operations in Switzerland, and Sergei Roldugin himself is on the Swiss sanctions list. . A verdict is expected on 30 March. If convicted, the four bankers face only mild, suspended jail terms of up to seven months. To secure a guilty verdict at all, prosecutors will have to convince the court that Mr Roldugin's millions in fact belonged to Vladimir Putin.. Not an easy task now that the usual co-operation between states - in this case Switzerland and Russia - on money laundering investigations is not happening. . No-one really knows how much President Putin, and those close to him, actually have. His stated salary is only a little over $100,000 (£84,400), the Swiss indictment points out. . But there are rumours his fortune could be worth a staggering $125bn (£105bn), carefully stashed away in a complex web of shell companies and accounts of friends like Sergei Roldugin.. That's why, despite the modest sentences, a guilty verdict could be so significant. It would send a signal not only to Russia's president, his friends, and the rest of his political establishment, that their cash can no longer be so easily hidden, but also to the professionals who have administered their funds.. \"Roldugin is not alone in his alleged role as one of 'Putin's wallets',\" said Tom Keatinge, head of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute.  . \"Those banks and law firms providing services to other close connections of Vladimir Putin should be on notice that the authorities are clearly energised to make their case in court.\".

Michelle Williams said the news her husband was alive brought relief to her and their 11-year-old son, she told local ABC affiliate WBTW. . \"My heart is breaking for the other two families that don't get to say the same,\" she said. . Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown died after unidentified gunmen opened fire as the group of four drove a white minivan on 3 March through Matamoros, a city of 500,000 people located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville. . A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander more than one block away, was killed in last Friday's incident.. The group had travelled from South Carolina and crossed the border into Mexico because Ms McGee had an appointment for a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat, her relatives said.. The four Americans were found at a wooden shack outside Matamoros after being transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday \"to create confusion\", Mexican officials said on Tuesday. . They were brought back under armed escort by a heavily armed Mexican military convoy.. Ms Williams said her husband Eric Williams was emotional as he spoke to her on the phone as he had considered Brown and Woodard to be like his \"brothers\".. Ms McGee was also emotional, crying on the phone to her mother, Barbara Burgess, who told local CNN affiliate WPDE her daughter \"watched two of them die\" right \"in front of her\". . This video can not be played. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. A video of the kidnapping shows the four Americans being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men.

Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US state department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\"..

        "content": "Watch: Protesters face tear gas and water cannons - as MPs brawl in parliament - over a \"Russian-style\" bill. The new law would class non-government and media groups as \"foreign agents\" if they get more than 20% of their funding from abroad.. Police arrested 66 people overnight, including a Georgian opposition leader.. Zurab Japaridze suffered a serious injury after he was detained.. A public official who visited Mr Japaridze in detention said he had been hit by a baton during the arrest. . Authorities said 55 police were hurt when stones and petrol bombs were thrown at them. Some of the most arresting images of the night came when water cannon was sprayed at protesters waving EU flags. . Riot police eventually moved in to clear protesters from Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament.. Crowds grew outside parliament again on Wednesday, as protesters sought to challenge the draft \"foreign agents\" law. Some 10,000 people had turned out by late afternoon and another 10 people were arrested.. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili denounced the \"stir\" over the draft law, which went through its first reading inside parliament on Tuesday. Ruling party Georgian Dream maintains the legislation dates back to US legislation in the 1930s. The same argument was used by Russia after it passed a similar law in 2012.. Russia's law has since been expanded to suppress Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers. Anyone identified as a foreign agent now has to highlight a foreign-agent label on their publication.. Many of the protesters in the centre of Tbilisi were students. \"We think that our government is under Russian influence and it's very bad for our future,\" said Lizzie.. Opposition-supporting TV stations have also dubbed the proposed legislation as a \"Russian law\". . Georgia has applied to the European Union for candidate status and also aims to join Nato, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Another student, Lia Chagovadze, said she and her friends were there to fight for Western values and freedom, while Nanuka Shakinovi said the protesters would not allow the government to stop Georgia's push to join the EU: \"We are going to fight them and we will not stop until we win.\". \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old Luka Kimeridze.. Georgian Dream chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said criticism of the draft law as similar to Russia's own repressive legislation was misleading. \"In the end, the stir will die out and the public will have transparency in the funding of NGOs,\" he said.. However, Eka Gigauri of Transparency International told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Political tensions in Georgia have been heightened by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seen by many Georgians as a war of aggression by Moscow, and many thousands of Russians have fled there. However, the government in Tbilisi has adopted a neutral stance, refusing to openly back Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia.. Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". She has vowed to veto the legislation, but Georgian Dream has enough votes to override the president's veto in parliament. The party has applied to the Council of Europe for its opinion.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote in parliament as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\", while the chairman of Georgian Dream condemned the embassy's comment as \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . US state department spokesman Ned Price warned that the new law would \"strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\".. Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. ",

        "content": "Some US officials have concluded that Covid \"most likely\" came from an unintended lab leak in Wuhan, China.. But many scientists point out there is no evidence that it leaked from a lab.. And the White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the virus's origins.. The committee of nine Republicans and seven Democrats has said it would aim to conduct its work above partisanship.. But at Wednesday's hearing, the committee's top Democrat Raul Ruiz argued against the inclusion of witness Nicholas Wade over a controversial book he authored.. Mr Ruiz said the former New York Times journalist's inclusion was dangerous and that he could not be relied on.. The congressman said the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, Dr David Duke, had endorsed a 2014 book by Mr Wade, which argued races evolved differently.. Mr Wade denied it was a racist book and another key witness, Dr Robert Redfield, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, defended Mr Wade as \"an outstanding science writer\".. Dr Redfield was an early proponent of the lab leak theory, and used his appearance on Wednesday to restate his opposition to so-called gain of function research, in which viruses are manipulated to become more infectious in lab environments.. He told the committee it was \"not scientifically plausible\" to him that the virus had natural origins.. \"It was told to me that they wanted a single narrative, and that I obviously had a different point of view,\" he said.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. Dr Redfield told the committee he believed the US taxpayer had funded gain of function research at the Wuhan institute.. Last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray .  as the \"most likely\" origin of Covid.. A few days before that, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan, but could only reach that conclusion with \"low confidence\".. In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said that there was no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.. ",
