        "content": "It flew about 1,000km (620 miles) landing in waters west of Japan.. It is Pyongyang's fourth missile launch in a week and comes as the US and South Korea hold joint navy drills.. The other missiles launched - last Thursday, on Saturday and on Monday - had been short-range ballistic missiles.. North Korea's ramped-up missile activity will most likely be top of the agenda when South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol meets Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo later on Thursday - the first such visit in 12 years.. Since Monday, the US and South Korea have been carrying out drills around the Korean peninsula- the allies' largest in five years. North Korea has repeatedly said it sees such exercises as provocation.. Thursday's missile was fired at 07:10 (22:10 GMT) from Pyongyang on the east coast of North Korea, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. . Japan's defence ministry confirmed it as an ICBM type and said it flew higher than 6,000km for about 70 minutes. It landed at about 08:20 outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, the ministry said. . Japan officials have not reported any damage from the missile. . Following Thursday's launch, Mr Yoon ordered his country's military to continue with the joint US exercises as planned.. Pyongyang would pay for its \"reckless provocations\", he said. . North Korea last fired an ICBM less than a month ago - an action that sparked a UN emergency meeting and condemnation from G7 countries.. ICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range. Experts have said that such missiles launched from North Korea could potentially reach mainland United States. . Pyongyang is also believed to have developed ICBMs that can carry multiple warheads. . The escalation in North Korean aggression over the past year is one of the central topics to be discussed at the Tokyo meeting on Thursday.. Many hope the meeting - which has been hailed as a \"milestone\" in the rapprochement of South Korea and Japan - will result in closer security ties and military cooperation between the two countries.. Both countries said they would convene their national security councils following Thursday's missile launch.. In 2022, North Korea launched more than 90 missiles - .  - despite being subject to a raft of sanctions from the UN, the US, the EU and its neighbouring countries.. North Korea has become more assertive in its nuclear strategy under Kim Jong-un, who has overseen much of its recent development of its weapons programme, and four of the six nuclear tests so far..

        "content": "A request for a change in ownership, first reported in the . , was confirmed to BBC News by TikTok.. The company said a forced sale would not change its data flows or access.. The White House has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment.. For years American officials have raised concerns that data from the popular app could fall into the hands of the Chinese government.. According to the WSJ, US President Joe Biden's administration wants ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok to create a clear break from China. . The newspaper said the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), which oversees national security risks, unanimously recommended ByteDance divest from TikTok.. A spokesperson for TikTok said it did not dispute the WSJ's reporting and confirmed it had been contacted by CFIUS. . However, the spokesperson said the reporting was overstated and it was not clear what \"divestiture\" meant in practice. . \"If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.\" the spokesperson said. . \"The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems\".. A ban was first threatened under then-President Donald Trump in 2020. . However, Mr Biden's administration has also taken a dim view of the social network.. TikTok hoovers up huge amounts of data on its users, similar to Instagram and Twitter. . It can take biometric data from users and has access to location data. The fear is the information could be passed to the Chinese government. . TikTok says it has undertaken an effort to move all US-based data to the US as part of an initiative it calls Project Texas.. The company has told BBC News it still plans to move forward with that plan.. The development comes a week after new legislation was announced that would expand the president's authority to ban TikTok nationwide was unveiled in the senate. . The Restrict Act would allow the US Commerce Department to declare foreign-linked companies national security risks. . TikTok is banned on government phones in the US, Canada and the EU. . Its chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, is set to testify before the US Congress next week in a widely anticipated showdown.. ",

        "content": "They found that 10 drums containing uranium ore had disappeared, the IAEA said.. There are fears the uranium could pose a radiological risk as well as nuclear security concerns.. In a statement, the IAEA said it would conduct further activities \"to clarify the circumstances of the removal of the nuclear material and its current location\".. It is unclear when the uranium went missing. Inspectors had reportedly wanted to visit the location last year, but the trip had to be postponed because of fighting between different Libyan militias.. The IAEA said that the site where the uranium was stored was not in government-controlled territory.. Since Libya's former dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, the country has been divided into competing political and military factions. . It is now split between an interim government in the capital Tripoli and another one in the east.. ",

        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Later on Wednesday, the Lahore High Court ordered police to postpone the arrest of Mr Khan until Thursday, pending the result of a hearing on the legitimacy of the arrest warrant.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. On Wednesday, the streets outside Mr Khan's home were littered with debris and smouldering barricades.. His supporters gathered at one of the roads - a major highway in Lahore - and chanted his name.. Hours earlier, officers in riot gear had fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to disperse hundreds of supporters at the compound. Some in the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. \"I have never witnessed such brutality, that's what shocks me,\" Waqar Khan, a PTI supporter told the BBC.. Recalling Tuesday's clashes, one woman, Tazeen, said: \"Are we not humans? What kind of a country is this? People around me could not breathe,\" one woman, Tazeen, said.. Mr Khan has said he did not appear in court because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . He earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. ",
