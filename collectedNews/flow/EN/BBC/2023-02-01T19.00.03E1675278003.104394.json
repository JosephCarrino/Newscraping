        "content": "CBS has reported that the investigation relates to a wider probe into the handling of classified documents. . The FBI has not commented on the search. As it was consensual, no search warrant was sought. . Mr Biden's lawyer, Bob Bauer, said the search was carried out \"without advance public notice\" in the interests of \"operational security and integrity\". . The search is the latest in a series carried out at various locations, after classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center - an office space - in Washington DC in November. This was not made public at the time. . More documents were discovered at another of Mr Biden's homes in Wilmington, Delaware, in searches conducted in December and January. . The precise number of classified records recovered remains unclear - although at least a dozen were found during the January searches alone. . Mr Biden has said his team did \"what they should have done\" by alerting officials immediately, and that they are \"co-operating fully and completely\" with the investigation. . After the first of January's searches, Mr Biden told reporters the files were in a locked garage. . \"It's not like they are sitting in the street,\" he said. . The latest search comes a day after special counsel Robert Hur officially began his duties overseeing the probe into the documents. . President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence have also been embroiled in controversy over the handling of classified documents.. In Mr Pence's case, a \"small number of documents bearing classified markings\" were found at his home in Carmel, Indiana, according to a letter sent to the National Archives by his lawyer. The documents were recovered by the FBI from a safe at the property on 19 January, with two boxes more delivered to the Archives on 23 January. . An August 2022 search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida uncovered dozens of boxes and about 11,000 documents, including about 100 with classified markings. . The search warrant came after attorneys representing Mr Trump had said all government records were returned. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he had declassified the documents taken with him.. The justice department search of Joe Biden's holiday home adds one more twist to a classified documents saga that has stretched on for nearly a month now and includes a special counsel overseeing the inquiry. . The FBI move could reveal how forthcoming and thorough the Biden team has been in reviewing the documents stored on his personal property. For the most part, the Biden lawyers have been conducting their own review of the president's personal residences without government investigators looking over their shoulders. While they found classified material at the president's Wilmington home, they have said that there were no such documents found at the president's beach house. . If the FBI finds such material, it will add fuel to the assertions by Mr Biden's critics that there is more to this story than the president's team is letting on.. At the very least, the search will help quell some of the concerns expressed by Republicans that the government is holding Mr Biden to a lower level of scrutiny and suspicion than Donald Trump, who had his Mar-a-Lago estate searched by the FBI last August. When Mr Biden's lawyers first revealed they had found classified material at his home and personal office, the former president, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and other conservatives openly wondered why the current president wasn't targeted by government investigators as well.. Now, however, Mr Biden's defenders are pointing out that multiple Biden properties have been searched, but there is no indication that the FBI has investigated Mr Trump's New Jersey and New York homes..

        "content": "Watch: \"You know I'm innocent\" - Andrew Tate yells to reporters. Mr Tate, 36, and his brother Tristan were arrested last month on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group. . Both men have denied wrongdoing.. Last month a judge extended their detention until 27 February - a decision upheld by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on Wednesday. . At the time the judge explained his decision, describing \"the capacityâ€¦ of the defendants to exercise permanent psychological control over the victims, including by resorting to constant acts of violence\".. Police have not yet laid any charges against the brothers, who moved to Romania five years ago. . Earlier, handcuffed to his brother Tristan, he shouted to waiting reporters that he was innocent as he arrived for the hearing.. Tina Glandian, a new US legal advisor hired by the Tate brothers to help in the appeal, argued their detention without charge for more than 30 days was a violation of international human rights law.. Ms Glandian has experience in representing high-profile figures such as Mike Tyson and Chris Brown, and specialises in international human rights.. Speaking to reporters before the appeal was rejected, she alleged that \"outside pressures\" had impacted the case on the case, but declined to explain what those pressures might be.. \"So far the system has failed,\" she said.. There is speculation that her appointment could bring a new approach to the Tates' legal team, as they try to secure the brothers' release from preventative custody.. The brothers - who have both US and UK citizenship - have also employed a communications specialist to respond to media interest in the case.. Mr Tate rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted - although he has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting an ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. He regularly appeared in videos with a fleet of expensive sports cars, on private jets, and enjoying expensive holidays.. 29 December 2022 - Tate brothers . 30 December 2022 - Court rules Tate brothers will . 10 January 2023 - Tate brothers .  against their detention. 15 January 2023 - Police seize . 20 January 2023 - Judge .  until 27 February. 1 February 2023 - Appeal against extension is rejected by judges.

        "content": "Authorities sprung into action, mobilising specialist search crews to look for the capsule, with firefighters among those asked to foray from their usual summer tasks.. Experts were called in from across the country: nuclear science specialists, the emergency management agency and radiation protection officials.  . Authorities believed the capsule had fallen off a radiation gauge that was being transported from a Rio Tinto mine site on 12 January to a storage facility in the north-eastern suburbs of Perth. . They thought vibrations during transit may have caused the bolts to become loose, allowing the capsule to fall through gaps in the casing and truck.. Caesium-137 (Cs-137) capsules are commonly used in radiation gauges in mining to measure the density of certain materials. But if you come into contact with one, it can cause severe burns and expose you to the equivalent of 10 x-rays per hour. . Before notifying the public to the threat, on 26 January, authorities began searching in Perth and around the mine site in Newman.. On 27 January, an urgent health warning was issued to notify the public about the risk posed by the radioactive capsule. Health authorities had a simple message to anyone who may come across it: Stay away. . \"It emits both beta rays and gamma rays so if you have it close to you, you could either end up with skin damage including skin burns,\" the state's Chief Health Officer Andy Robertson warned.. Authorities were concerned it may have become lodged in the tyre of a passing car.. By 27 January, search parties were in full force looking for the tiny capsule. But they were not scouting for it using their eyes - they were using portable radiation survey meters. . The survey meters are designed to detect radioactivity within a 20m radius.. \"We are not trying to find the small capsule by eyesight. The radiation equipment will hopefully lead us to it,\" a police spokesperson said the following day.. Police focused their efforts on the GPS route the truck had taken, and on sites close to Perth's metropolitan and high-density areas.. One site along the Great Northern Highway was prioritised by police on 28 January after unusual activity on a Geiger counter - a device used for measuring radioactivity - was reported by a member of public.. But that search did not uncover the capsule.. The next day, additional resources requested from Australia's federal government had been approved and those overseeing the search began planning its next phase.. With the new equipment in Western Australia and ready for use by 30 January, the search ramped up.. An incident controller at the state's emergency services department, Darryl Ray, described the new tools provided by the government only as \"specialised radiation detection equipment\". . Local media reported that radiation portal monitors and a gamma-ray spectrometer were among the new items being used by search crews.. Radiation portal monitors detect gamma radiation and are typically used at airports to scan individuals to ensure they do not have radioactive substances on them. Gamma spectrometers measure the intensity of the radiation.. Mr Ray said the new detection equipment could be attached to vehicles so searches could be done from moving vehicles at about 50km/h. . \"It will take approximately five days to travel the original route, an estimated 1400km, with crews travelling north and south along Great Northern Highway,\" he said.. But by the end of 31 January, the capsule continued to evade search crews.. \"More than 660km has been searched so far - thank you to all agencies for their support,\" the Department of Fire and Emergency Services said.. So the next morning, when the government revealed the capsule had been found just two metres off the side of the highway at 11:13 local time Wednesday, it seemed the all-but-impossible had been achieved.. Authorities said search crews had \"quite literally found the needle in the haystack\".. \"You can only imagine it's a pretty lonely stretch of road from Newman down to Perth,\" Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said at a press conference on Wednesday. . \"You can't help but imagine there was an element of surprise from the people in the car when the equipment did spike up.\". While hesitant to give the exact location the radioactive capsule was found, Mr Klemm described it as \"the best possible outcome\". . Local media reports suggest it was found some 74km from Newman - so around 200km from the mine site.. No one appeared to have been injured by the capsule, according to authorities, and it did not seem to have moved from where it fell.. Mr Klemm said the additional resources from the federal government proved key to finding the capsule.. He said the survey equipment used from the start to detect radioactivity - paired with the specialised equipment that physically located the capsule - is how a car driving past at 70km/h found it.. A check of the serial code on the capsule confirmed it was the right one.. Associate Professor Nigel Marks from Western Australia's Curtin University hailed the find as a \"victory for science\".. \"You know it emits gamma radiation so the obvious thing is to comb the side of the road looking for something with a strong gamma signal... and sure enough that's exactly where they found it.\" . Dr Marks added that many \"orphan sources\" - a self-contained radioactive material - that get lost are generally not recovered.. \"A surprisingly large number of these sources that get lost - never get found\", he said. . \"It's a regulatory failure, but I think the way they found it is really cool.\". The chair of Australia's Radiological Council will now investigate exactly how the capsule was misplaced in the first place.. The outcome of the report will determine whether or not charges are laid against Rio Tinto. . After the capsule was found the Chief Executive of Rio Tinto, Simon Trott, said the company would \"fully cooperate\" with the investigation. . He added that Rio Tinto would foot the bill for the search if the government requested it.. ",

        "content": "Meanwhile, the military administration in the country has extended a state of emergency for six months. . The UK, US, Canada and Australia have announced fresh sanctions against army-linked firms.. Large parts of Myanmar descended into chaos after . , displacing more than a million people. . The army had made allegations of widespread fraud in a vote held months earlier, in November 2020, which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won with more than 80% of the vote. . The military's claims have been dismissed as baseless by the vast majority of the international community, and plans to hold new elections to cement junta rule have been dismissed as a \"sham\", including by the UN. . Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a pro-democracy activist, said resistance against the military was continuing, particularly in rural areas. . \"The main message of the silent strike is to honour the fallen heroes and heroines and to reclaim the public space as our own,\" she told the BBC, adding that the aim was to send a clear message that the military \"shall never rule us\". . Protesters also gathered outside Myanmar's embassies in Thailand and Japan, chanting anti-military slogans and holding portraits of Ms Suu Kyi.. A small pro-military demonstration took place in Yangon, where an estimated 200 supporters marched through the city centre escorted part of the way by soldiers, AFP news agency reported. . Two years after the coup, which catastrophically misread the public mood in Myanmar, the statistics tell their own, dismal story. . More than 2,900 people have been killed during the junta's crackdown on dissent, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.. One-and-a-half million people have been displaced, 40,000 homes have been burned down, eight million children are no longer in school, and 15 million people are judged by the UN to be dangerously short of food. . Much of the country is caught up in a brutal civil war. Yet the military is still refusing to negotiate with its opponents, as it promised to do in a meeting with neighbouring countries shortly after the coup. . Instead, it has plans for an election which would almost certainly exclude Ms Suu Kyi, who resoundingly won the last election, and much of her party, the NLD.. Those loyal to her are calling on citizens to boycott any poll organised by the military, arguing it would be illegitimate and impractical. The UN says these would be \"sham elections\". . The military's acknowledgement this week that it had failed to normalise the situation may force it to postpone the election - originally scheduled for August this year - having now extended the state of emergency, prolonging the grim stalemate in which Myanmar is trapped.. Western nations used Wednesday's anniversary to coordinate new rounds of sanctions against the military and its supporters. . The UK targeted, among others, companies supplying aviation fuel to the military, which it said were \"enabling its barbaric air-raiding campaign in an attempt to maintain power\".. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the sanctions were aimed at \"reducing the military's access to finance, fuel, arms and equipment\". . Australia announced its first sanctions against the military, aimed at 16 individuals \"responsible for egregious human rights abuses\", as well as two major military-controlled conglomerates, which dominate the country's economy.  . Sanctions by the US targeted the military-approved election commission, which \"the regime has deployed to advance its plans for deeply flawed elections\". . The National Unity Government - a parallel administration that leads opposition to the military - welcomed the sanctions, calling them \"significant measures\" to tackle the conflict, particularly air strikes by the military.. It called on countries to place further \"aggressive, targeted sanctions\" on the military regime and those who supported and supplied it.. Amnesty International's Montse Ferrer told the BBC that moves to stop the supply of aviation fuel to the Myanmar military were \"an important step\" but that more needed to be done. . \"Other states should follow Canada's lead in suspending the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer - including transit, trans-shipment and brokering - of aviation fuel to Myanmar,\" she said. .

        "content": "Ukraine has launched an anti-corruption drive and officials said the leaders of the customs service had been fired.. The head of President Volodymyr Zelensky's party in parliament said Ukraine would change during the war.. \"If anyone isn't ready for change, then the state itself will come and help them change,\" said David Arakhamia on the Telegram messaging app.. Ukraine has come under increasing pressure from its Western partners, notably the EU, to tackle corruption. When Mr Zelensky came to power in 2019 he cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities. . Kyiv is due to host a summit with leading EU officials this week, seen by Ukraine as highly important in its push for membership of the 27-member union. Kyiv was granted EU candidate status four months after Russia's invasion, but it was urged to do more to tackle corruption.. Ten leading Ukrainian figures resigned last week, as part of the purge, including Mr Zelensky's deputy head of office Kyrylo Tymoshenko. . Several deputy ministers and regional governors were also squeezed out. Mr Zelensky said at the time that any internal problems that hindered the state would be cleaned up to help Ukraine's \"rapprochement with European institutions\". . Mr Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine's best-known individuals and Ukrainian websites published pictures of detectives searching his home in the south-eastern city of Dnipro as he looked on.. The tycoon took on the role of governor of the wider Dnipropetrovsk region in 2014 and played a key role in funding volunteer battalions in response to Russia's initial landgrab in eastern Ukraine. . However, the US placed him under sanctions for alleged \"significant corruption\" during his time as governor. He has denied any wrongdoing.. Mr Kolomoisky is also a wealthy businessman involved in Ukrainian media, oil and banking. His TV channel gave Mr Zelensky his break with the comedy series Servant of the People, before he backed the former actor's bid for the presidency. . In a statement that made no mention of the tycoon, the economic security bureau said it had exposed large-scale embezzlement schemes and tax evasion worth 40bn hyrivnia ($1bn; Â£880m) by the former management of Ukraine's two biggest oil firms, Ukranafta and Ukrtatnafta. . There was no initial comment from Mr Kolomoisky, whose companies had a substantial stake in both companies. They were among several strategic businesses transferred to state ownership last November. Weeks earlier, Mr Kolomoisky's flat was searched in western Ukraine.. In a separate raid, the former interior minister, Arsen Avakov, told Ukrainian media that his home had been searched as part of an inquiry into Ukraine's purchase of Airbus helicopters six years ago.. Mr Avakov was quoted as saying that nothing had been found and all the contracts had been approved at the time.. The move followed a deadly helicopter crash outside a kindergarten in a suburb of the capital Kyiv that left 14 people dead, including the interior minister, his entourage and a child on the ground. . Referring to the latest anti-corruption swoop as \"spring landings\", Mr Arakhamia listed further investigations, including the dismissal of the entire leadership of the customs service. MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the acting head and two deputies had been fired.. The main tax office in Kyiv was also raided.. ",
