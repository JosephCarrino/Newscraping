        "content": "Russia seized the north-eastern city early in the full-scale invasion, with Ukraine recapturing it last September.. Meanwhile, Russian mercenaries say they have \"practically encircled\" the key city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.. The comments were made by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who heads the paramilitary Wagner group.. In its latest news bulletin, Ukraine's military said Russian troops continued their offensive on Bakhmut - but the attacks were \"repelled\". . Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted the situation in Bakhmut - about 130km (80 miles) south-east of Kupiansk - was becoming . In Kupiansk, the Kharkiv regional military administration said on Thursday the evacuation order was due to the \"unstable security situation\" caused by Russian shelling.. It said those evacuated would be provided with assistance, including accommodation, food, humanitarian aid and medical support.. Other citizens were also permitted to leave the region, it added. The city had a pre-war population of around 25,000.. The military said 812 children are currently registered in Kupiansk and the surrounding district, as well as 724 disabled people..

The Institute for the Study of War .  that Russian forces were continuing \"limited ground attacks\" north-east of Kupiansk, as well as offensive operations around Kreminna, about 80km south-east.. Kupiansk - home to an important railway junction - has witnessed fierce fighting since the war began, with Russia taking control in a matter of days, and occupying the city for several months. . However, in September Ukrainian forces took back control amid a .  that saw almost entire of the Kharkiv region brought under Kyiv's control.. Those advances - and the liberation of the southern city of Kherson - were the most significant front-line changes since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. . Last month, Ukraine warned that Russia was preparing a major new offensive, with officials saying Moscow has amassed thousands of troops on Ukraine's eastern flank.. And Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned a month ago that Russia could.  on 24 February. . But that apparent escalation has not translated into major successes on the battlefield, despite apparent advances around Kupiansk and Bakhmut.. In a video posted on Telegram, Mr Prigozhin, head of the paramilitary group Wagner, on Friday said that \"pincers are closing in\" around Bakhmut. . And in a direct message to President Zelensky, he said Wagner units had \"practically encircled\" the city, with only one road remaining. He called on the Ukrainian president to abandon the city.. In a separate development on Friday, Vladimir Putin is chairing a meeting with the country's top security officials.. It comes a day after the Russian president accused a Ukrainian sabotage group of entering a Russian border region and opening fire on civilians.. The governor of Bryansk region said \"saboteurs from Ukraine\" had fired at a civilian car in Lyubechane, a border village, killing two men and wounding a 10-year-old boy.. Kyiv strongly denied the Russian claim, describing it as Moscow's provocation.. ",

        "content": "Not enough of the new notes were released, leading to widespread anger and frustration.. Many people were unable to get cash to pay for food and slept outside banks.. The policy was announced last October and the new notes were released in mid-December. People were initially given until the end of January to hand in all their old notes, although this had previously been extended amid the chaotic scenes.. Reading out the ruling, Justice Emmanuel Agim said the correct process had not been followed.. \"The directive given by President is invalid. Such directive is not just handed down after personal conversation with the governor of CBN [Central Bank of Nigeria],\" he said.. The court also berated President Muhammadu Buhari for not obeying a previous provisional order to halt the policy until it decided the case. It said there was nothing to show that President Buhari's directive for the release of old 200 naira notes until 10 April was implemented.. \"Disobedience of order of court shows the country's democracy [is] a mere pretension and now replaced by autocracy,\" it said in a scathing verdict.. Nigerians are still experiencing difficulties accessing cash at banks and cash machines and it is not clear what immediate impact the reversal will have.. Many had already deposited their old notes at the banks and with the new ones unavailable, large numbers have switched to online banking.. However, millions of people and businesses in the rural areas remain heavily dependent on cash.. Sixteen Nigerian states had challenged the redesign of the 200, 500, and 1,000 naira notes, saying that the deadline was too tight.. The central bank said that the redesign would help bring down inflation, control the amount of money in circulation and make ransom payments in Nigeria's huge kidnap industry more difficult. Many suspected that the policy was also targeted at politicians involved in vote-buying during elections.. A tightly contested presidential election last Saturday was won by the ruling party. Some cases of vote-buying were reported, but fewer than in previous polls.. ",

        "content": "Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.. He faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.. Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.. Alex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.. \"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.. The case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO. . Murdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area. Such was their influence that the jurisdiction became known as \"Murdaugh Country\".. But the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.. Murdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.. After the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.. Reporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.. It took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case. . In a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.. \"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.. The case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial. . Instead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.. This video can not be played. Watch: Jury finds Murdaugh guilty. Paul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle. . For 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping. . But in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background. . On the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state. . The court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. The hitman he hired botched the shooting and the bullet only grazed his head.. Local resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter. . \"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\". Early on in the proceedings, Judge Clifton Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.. Investigators say he stole nearly $9m from clients and colleagues to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft. . Prosecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.. Murdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder. . Several witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle. . Maggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.. Alex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns. . Prosecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.. Maggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.. ",

They were demanding its help to repair and build new roads in the area.. A civilian was also killed and nine oilfield workers captured alongside the police officers. Video showed the hostages sitting in a crowded room on rows of chairs and on the floor.. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he hoped they would be \"unilaterally\" released before any escalation of violence, and asked for medical help from the Red Cross.. Many of the protesters are rural and indigenous people who want Emerald Energy to build new road infrastructure around the San Vicente del Caguan area.. The oil company did not respond when approached by Reuters news agency for comment.. Colombian police paid tribute on Twitter to the police officer killed in the clash, who they named as Ricardo Monroy.. \"Today we are more united than ever,\" they wrote, adding that Mr Monroy had \"offered his life in the line of duty\".. Local government officials said the officer died from a machete attack, while the civilian was killed by gunfire.. Colombia's human rights ombudsman Carlos Camargo - who was on site to mediate - said he had spoken with protesters and stopped them from firing Molotov cocktails at the oil facility.. Protests in areas near energy and mining operations in Colombia are common as communities demand companies build infrastructure, including roads and schools.. Police said a dissident subgroup of Farc rebels which rejected the 2016 peace deal were present in the region and may have been provoking the unrest.. Separately, Mr Petro on Thursday unexpectedly published a statement on Twitter asking the country's prosecutor general to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption involving his own son and brother.. The statement did not specify the accusations against his eldest son, Nicolas Petro Burgos, and brother, Juan Fernando Petro Urrego, but it did say: \"my government will not give out benefits to criminals in exchange for bribes\". .

Demonstrators were met with police brutality and Lukashenko critics .  during the demonstrations, which started in 2020.. Mr Bialiatski was in court alongside two fellow campaigners, Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich. .

He doesn't complain about his health - he tries not to upset me.\" . Kostya Staradubets, a spokesperson for Viasna, said the sentences imposed on the three activists were \"breaking our hearts\". . Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, he said: \"We knew that our three colleagues would get long prison terms but anyway it's still a shock, it's breaking our hearts, not only the [prison] terms are long but the conditions also very horrific.. \"We call [the conditions] torture actually because they're being held for several months in a 19th Century building, poorly lit cells with no fresh air, no sunlight, poor food, little or no healthcare.\" .
