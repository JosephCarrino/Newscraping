        "content": "Labour's Peter Obi has close to 18%, having caused an upset by defeating Mr Tinubu in the biggest city, Lagos. . On Monday, Mr Abubakar's and Mr Obi's parties walked out of the venue where results are being announced.. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party have claimed there is a lack of transparency with the new electronic voter system.. This was the first national election where an electronic device had been used to accredit voters.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. Its chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. European Union observers said the electoral body's poor planning and communication undermined trust in the process.. The PDP representative at the election centre in the capital, Abuja, described the process as fraudulent, and accused the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec. The Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. The APC and PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999.. Mr Obi - from the previously little-known Labour Party - ran for the first time, promising to challenge the two-party system. . He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. From the results announced so far Mr Tinubu has won the most votes in six states, Mr Abubakar five and Mr Obi three.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. If those thresholds are not reached then there will a second round run-off between the top two candidates.. ",

        "content": "The order follows similar moves by the EU and Canada in recent weeks. . A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry accused the US of abusing state power to suppress foreign firms.. \"We firmly oppose those wrong actions,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday. \"The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, stop suppressing the companies and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the US.\". \"How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that,\" she added. . Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the popular video sharing app - which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance - in recent months. . TikTok has faced allegations that it harvests users' data and hands it to the Chinese government, with some intelligence agencies worried that sensitive information could be exposed when the app is downloaded to government devices.. TikTok says it would never comply with an order to share user data and insists it operates no differently from other social media companies.. On Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young told agencies they had to scrub the app from all state-issued phones to protect confidential data. . The agency said the guidance marked a \"critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data\". . Some federal offices - including the White House and the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State - have already banned TikTok from their devices. . The US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said the move emphasised President Joe Biden administration's \"ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people's security and privacy\". . Tuesday's announcement follows the passage of legislation by the US House of Representatives in December which banned the use of TikTok on state-issued phones and gave the White House 60 days to issue agency directives. . And congressional Republicans are expected to pass further legislation in the coming weeks which would give President Biden the power to ban the app nationally. .  starting from Tuesday. The decision followed a review conducted by the country's chief information officer, who ruled the app presented \"an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\".. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.. \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.. Last week, the European Commission and the European Council ordered employees to remove the TikTok app from their phones and corporate devices. . \"The measure aims to protect the commission against cyber-security threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the commission,\" a commission employee said. .

        "content": "\"The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions\", Mr Zelensky stated.. The Ukrainian leader's remarks came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China against arming Russia during a visit to Kyiv on Monday.. Some of the fiercest fighting to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a year ago has taken place in Bakhmut, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, part of which is under the control of Russia and its separatist allies.. Recently efforts by Russian forces to capture the industrial city have intensified, with its troops gaining ground.. The separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, said \"practically all roads\" into the city were \"under [Russian] fire control\".. And the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the situation around Bakhmut was \"extremely tense\". . \"Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defences of our troops and surround the city,\" Gen Syrskyi said.. Speaking about the situation in his nightly address, President Zelensky said managing to gain a foothold in Bakhmut and ensuring its defence were being heavily compromised by Russia's renewed onslaught.. He was \"grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding\" the area.. President Zelensky also called once again for modern combat aircraft to be sent so that \"the entire territory of our country\" can be defended from \"Russian terror\".. On her surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, Janet Yellen announced the latest transfer of $1.25bn (Â£1bn) in economic and budget aid to Ukraine.. Ms Yellen reiterated US President Joe Biden's message - made during .  - that Washington would stand with Ukraine for as long as it took to win the war.. , Ms Yellen added that while Russia's economy had not yet buckled under the vast sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers, she expected it to grow weaker over time.. She also stated that Russia's ability to replenish military equipment destroyed in attacks on Ukraine was being \"gradually jeopardized\", adding that any move from China to supply such weaponry to Russia would lead to \"severe\" consequences.. \"We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,\" she said. . \"And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.\". Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said . . Beijing strongly denied the claim.. A meeting between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week looked to many to be an indication of China's close ties with Russia.. And Mr Putin's staunch ally, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, is scheduled to begin a three day tour of China on Tuesday. During the visit he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping. .

        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis. The bill strips power uniquely held by Disney for over 50 years and enables more oversight by Mr DeSantis' Republican-led legislature.. The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education.. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis.. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World.. \"There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\". For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department.. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 sq miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year.. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state.. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes.. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (Â£41,467) to Mr DeSantis' re-election campaign.. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed.. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\".. Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.. Friction between Disney, one of the world's biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April.. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under.. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content.. Mr DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power.. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that's happened over the past couple of years, I've always been very proud of our parks,\" he said.. \"It's almost like a right of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you've got to have people who can tell you the truth.\".
