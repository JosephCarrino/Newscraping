        "content": "Before the earthquake, 19-year-old Ceyda Ocan looked through that window and those curtains, on to her street in the city of Iskenderun. Now her best friend Damla is on the street with her family to keep vigil at the fallen apartment block, hoping that Ceyda has survived, as rescue workers sift and dogs sniff for signs of life.. Damla met Ceyda in the neighbourhood when she was six and Ceyda eight, and they stayed close. They bought those curtains together on a recent shopping trip. . \"We both love butterflies,\" Damla says, weeping. On her phone is a picture of a birthday cake Ceyda organised for Damla with her sister, and in purple icing with butterfly decorations it says: \"Who loves you the most in the world? Us of course!\". Ceyda's apartment block, called Orcan, sat in a row of mid-rise pink and beige buildings with small balconies, in the centre of Iskenderun, all with shops on the ground floor. When the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 on Monday, Ceyda would have been sleeping, along with the other residents of Orcan.. The block crumpled with the force of the tremor.. Many buildings in southern Turkey have been wiped out of existence this week, but this is the story of Orcan, home to Ceyda and her family alongside the residents of 14 other flats. In the days after the quake, their friends and family gathered round Orcan hoping for the best, and speaking of their loved ones.. We witnessed one brief moment of elation on Wednesday when a survivor was pulled from the rubble after more than a day of digging - one of Ceyda's neighbours. . According to rescuers and residents in the area, she managed to say that she had spoken to Ceyda through the fallen walls, and that Ceyda had said she was OK. But officials warned that the survivor was disorientated - it might not have actually happened. By Friday, there was no more news. . We went back to Orcan for three days in a row to witness the informal rescue efforts, the people fleeing for safer places, and the field hospitals erected for survivors. Rescuers and neighbours all told us that they knew of three people who survived - the rest are unaccounted for.. Those gathered said Orcan was home to a tight-knit community, where neighbours would frequently visit each other's homes for tea or strong Turkish coffee.. Residents of Orcan and other buildings on the street had WhatsApp groups and arranged regular meet-ups. \"It was like, your place this week, yours next,\" one local man said. \"This is the Turkish way.\". When asked what the neighbourhood was like, Damla's uncle Emrullah, who ran the local grocery shop, clasped his hands together. \"Like this,\" he said.. Orcan has stood for decades. \"I'm 50 years old and I remember walking past it on my way to and from school,\" one man said.. When the earthquake hit, locals told us the buildings on Orcan's row fell \"like dominoes\". On either side of the line of destruction, similar buildings appear unscathed and their residents spoke with both guilt and relief.. Cansu, a local paramedic, knew several of the people who lived in Orcan. After the earthquake hit, she left her home and ran round the corner to the entrance of Ceyda's street, she said.. The buildings along that row are now crumpled together in a mass of debris. Only a few traces of the residents inside are visible: a kite decorated with characters from the Disney film Frozen; a torn Quran; a squashed white oven; a red-rimmed clock, frozen in time.. A man whose grandfather - a swimming enthusiast with a love for beer and stuffed peppers - lived in the building next door reached into the rubble beneath Ceyda's curtains and pulled out a phone. . It was still working - and the background picture was his grandfather's face. The man smiled a bittersweet smile.. A mother, 63-year-old Sehvar, and her non-verbal daughter Derya lived on the first floor of the apartment block.. Family members watching the rescue efforts said the pair spent most of their time together at home, Sehvar caring for her daughter.. \"Even if she is alive and hears the sounds asking if anyone is out there, she will not be able to answer,\" said Derya's sister Deniz, who travelled from her home some two hours away to be at the wreckage.. On the same floor, on the other side of the building, lived university graduate Berk. One man said he was often seen around the neighbourhood drinking Coca-Cola, and joked that he must have drunk litres of it every day. . Many who talked about him said he was \"intelligent\", \"sociable\" and \"handsome\".. Berk's brother Dogukan said he was trapped beneath rubble at the foot of the building with his mother after the earthquake, but was rescued in the immediate aftermath. He was critical of the official rescue effort, and said he had waited under the rubble for nine hours.. He said he did not want to talk about the experience more while his brother was still missing, but neighbours said he had been rescued after managing to call his other brother, who was not at home at the time of the earthquake, for help. . Berk has not been seen in days and his mother is now in hospital with injuries, apparently telling doctors: \"I cannot feel my feet and my son is trapped inside\".. On the second floor lived another mother and daughter - 64-year-old Hatice and 33-year-old Derya.. One family member described the pair as being like Tom and Jerry.. \"Whatever one did, the other did the opposite. But they couldn't live without each other,\" the relative said. \"They are probably inches apart even now.\". Mevlut - Derya's father and Hatice's ex-husband - has waited each day for news of the pair.. He described his daughter as being \"beautiful\" and \"full of life\", cupping his hands around his face for emphasis.. In Derya's job, he said, she was responsible for ensuring safe environments in the workplace.. That meant she would know \"where to go, what to do, how to act\" in an emergency.. He was staying positive and was full of faith in his daughter's capabilities, holding out hope that she would \"lead her mother and others to a safe place in the building\".. Living with Ceyda on the third floor was her mother and father. Her older sister had moved away from home but was still nearby. Neighbours gathered told us that when her sister arrived at Orcan after the earthquake, she fainted and had to be carried away.. Her grandparents also lived around the corner. Their building, too, was destroyed by the earthquake.. Relatives describe them as a close family and the parents as the perfect couple.. Ceyda's dad, Cengiz, owned a spare parts shop. Her mum had lost two of her sisters earlier in life, and family members say they worry how she will cope if she is pulled from the wreckage to learn that her parents are also now dead.. Ceyda's popularity in the community is evident within minutes of arriving on the street. Friends faces light up when they recall memories of her, while both her current and ex-boyfriend join the search for her.. She was described as outgoing and thoughtful, and had been working hard to get into a university in Istanbul this year to study with Damla.. \"Her favourite thing is going for coffee,\" Damla says, adding that Ceyda would often take her friends out in her white Volkswagen car.. The car is now parked metres from the ruined apartment building, its windshield crushed. A red lighter can be seen inside.. On Friday, rescue workers called in through Ceyda's window: \"Is anyone alive there?\" before heavy machinery broke into the room, pushing those butterfly curtains into the debris.. Damla says she is still determined that Ceyda will be found safe and \"will smile again\".. While we stayed near the building, learning about its residents from friends and family, one survivor was pulled out.. It was Ferdane, a single mother in her 50s who is well-liked in the community.. She was the survivor who said she had spoken to Ceyda.. Rescue workers said she was injured and distressed and had been taken to hospital, where her adult son was at her bedside.. When she was being taken away, she had asked how long she had been under rubble for, one worker said. . Her son replied: \"Three days mama.\" She thought it had been six. . By Friday, though, rescue workers had told the families still waiting at the site that they should not expect any more survivors. . If there were, it would be a miracle, they said.. ",

        "content": "Watch: US official confirms downing of object over Alaska. Spokesman John Kirby said the unmanned object was \"the size of a small car\" and posed a \"reasonable threat\" to civilian aviation.. The object's purpose and origin was unclear, Mr Kirby said.. It comes a week after the American military destroyed a Chinese balloon over US territorial waters.. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Kirby said the debris field of the object shot down on Friday was \"much, much smaller\" than the balloon shot down last Saturday off the coast of South Carolina.. He said that the object was at 40,000ft (12,000m) over the northern coast Alaska.. Helicopters and transport aircraft have been deployed to collect debris from the frozen waters of the Beaufort Sea. . \"We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,\" Mr Kirby said.. The object was first spotted on Thursday night, though officials did not specify a time. . He said two fighter jets had approached the object and assessed there was nobody on board, and this information was available to Mr Biden when he made his decision.. \"We're going to remain vigilant about our airspace,\" Mr Kirby asserted. \"The president takes his obligations to protect our national security interests as paramount.\". Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that an F-22 jet shot down the object with a sidewinder missile at 13:45 EST (18:45 GMT).. The warplane was based out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.. Gen Ryder said a significant amount of debris had been recovered so far. It was being loaded on to vessels and taken to \"labs for subsequent analysis\", he added.. Officials said they had not yet determined whether the object, which was travelling north-east, was involved in surveillance, and Mr Kirby corrected a reporter who referred to it as a balloon.. He did not specify where exactly the object was shot down, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it had closed about 10 sq miles of US airspace airspace above Deadhorse, northern Alaska, before the F-22 fired.. No other objects of a threatening nature have been identified above the US at this time, according to the White House.. Mr Kirby said the object did not appear to have the manoeuvrable capability of the Chinese balloon and seemed to be \"virtually at the whim of the wind\".. Hours after the US shot down the balloon last Saturday, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called his Chinese counterpart via their special crisis line.. But Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe declined to pick up, according to the Pentagon.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\". . ",

        "content": "With the war raging in neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova has been facing inflation, high energy prices, a refugee influx and Russian aggression.. The news came just hours after Russian missiles flew over Moldovan airspace.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, Ms Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\".. Moldova is precariously close to the war - it shares a 1,222km (759 mile) border with Ukraine, and has suffered greatly from the fallout of Russia's invasion.. \"I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,\" Ms Gavrilita said at a news conference. . \"We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in,\" she said, referring to the Kremlin. . An energy crisis was sparked last year when Russia suddenly reduced its gas supplies to Moldova, which relied 100% on Russia for gas. It caused inflation to skyrocket and there was public unrest over the high energy costs.. President Maia Sandu thanked Ms Gavrilita for her \"enormous sacrifice and efforts to lead the country in a time of so many crises\".. \"We have stability, peace and development, where others wanted war and bankruptcy,\" the president said.. She has already nominated her former defence adviser Dorin Recean - who is also pro-EU - as the next prime minister. The Moldovan parliament will vote to confirm his nomination next week.. In the earlier days of the war in Ukraine, there were fears the conflict would spill over into Moldova, or that Russia might invade it too.. That concern has receded for now, but as . , pressure has increased from Russia - which has tried to undermine the former Soviet state, and the EU's influence.. In a stark warning on Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had a plan to \"destroy\" Moldova, according to Ukrainian intelligence.. \"These documents show who, when and how Russia is going to break democracy of Moldova and establish control,\" he told EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.. \"I immediately warned Moldova about these threats,\" he added.. Moldovan intelligence services later confirmed they had also identified \"subversive activities\" aimed at \"undermining the state of the Republic of Moldova, destabilizing and violating public order.\". There are also renewed tensions in Transnistria, a breakaway territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists that runs along Moldova's border with Ukraine, and where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed.. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of trying to turn Moldova against Russia - as he claimed it had already done with Ukraine.. Natalia Gavrilita became prime minister in August 2021 when President Sandu's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won a landslide parliamentary election.. She previously served as finance minister from June 2019 to November 2019 in when Ms Sandu was prime minister.. ",

        "content": "And yet the science will go on. The insights gleaned from this event will save lives in the future.. Take a look at the map on this page. It is the most precise yet produced of how the ground lurched in response to the enormous energies that were unleashed.. The data behind it was acquired in the early hours of Friday by the European Union's Sentinel-1A satellite as it traversed north to south over Turkey at an altitude of 700km (435 miles).. The Sentinel carries a radar instrument that is able to sense the ground in all weathers, day and night.. It is routinely scanning this earthquake-prone region of the world, tracing the often very subtle changes in elevation at the Earth's surface.. Except, of course, the changes on Monday were not subtle at all; they were dramatic. The ground bent, buckled and in places ripped apart.. Researchers use the technique of interferometry to compare \"before\" and \"after\" views. But you do not really need to be an expert to see the consequences for Turkey in the latest Sentinel map.. The red colours here describe movement towards the satellite since it last flew over the country; the blue colours record the movement away from the spacecraft.. It is abundantly clear how the ground has been deformed along and near the East Anatolian Fault line.. For both the Magnitude 7.8 quake that struck first on Monday at 01:17 GMT and the Magnitude 7.5 event at 10:24, the motion is \"left-lateral\". That is to say: whichever side of the fault you are on, the other side has moved to the left. And by several metres in places.. The shocking thing is that the lines of rupture have gone right through settlements; in lots of places they will have gone right through buildings.. The Sentinel map will help scientists understand exactly what happened on Monday, and this knowledge will feed into their models for how earthquakes work in the region, and then ultimately into the risk assessments that the Turkish authorities will use as they plan the recovery.. There is sure to be a lot of discussion about how the two major tremors were related and what that could mean for further instability.. The map was processed by the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (Comet). Its director, Prof Tim Wright, said the Sentinel observations vividly brought home the scale of the forces involved.. \"News outlets always show earthquakes as 'the epicentre', as if it is a single point source (like a bomb). Actually, all earthquakes are caused by slip on extended faults, and the bigger the quake the bigger the fault that ruptured,\" he told BBC News.. \"We can map those ruptures with satellites because the ground around them is displaced, in this case by up to 5m or 6m. The rupture of the first event was 300km or so long and the second big event ruptured another 140km or so of a different fault. To put those distances in context, London to Paris is roughly 345km.. \"Damage will be highest near the fault but of course spreads over a wide region either side of the fault, too. It's absolutely horrific.\". In the era before satellites, geologists would map earthquake faults by walking the lines of rupture. It was a laborious process that naturally also missed a lot of detail. Radar interferometry from space was developed in the 1990s, and in recent years it has become a particularly compelling tool. . In part that is down to the quality of the sensors now in orbit, but it is also the result of more powerful computers and smarter algorithms. . It is possible today to get a data product on to the computers of experts, ready for analysis, within hours of a satellite making an overhead pass. Comet, unfortunately, had to wait several days for Sentinel-1A to be in the right part of the sky to get an optimal view of Turkey. But this will improve as more and more radar satellites are launched.. \"By the end of the decade, we should be able to do this kind of analysis within a day of most damaging earthquakes, and then we would be more useful for the relief effort. As things stand, we are of course outside the 72-hour window for search and rescue,\" Prof Wright said.. ",

We saw residents waiting around in the cold squares surrounded by debris, many wrapped in blankets and coats. . In the eastern neighbourhood of al-Shaar, the sound of diggers rang out against the backdrop of multi-storey buildings flattened to the ground. . \"We know someone in that building who lived on the first floor... he didn't have enough time to get out of his house,\" one woman told us, gesturing towards a pile of rubble.. \"The building collapsed while he was still in there. He died alongside his wife and children,\" she said.. Only one of his daughters was saved from under the rubble and is in the hospital now..

Much of Aleppo was destroyed in the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned violent.. Despite efforts to rebuild some parts of the former cosmopolitan hub, the city still bears the wounds of the war between the Russian-backed Syrian government and rebel groups.. Now, rescue teams have to pull down even some of the buildings still standing, out of fear they might collapse later on. . \"Two buildings near me came down; they each contained around 30 flats, and at least five people were living in each flat,\" on man told us.. \"There are around 60 or 70 people still trapped under the rubble; only four or five people got out,\" he said..

Turkish social media has been filled with posts showing missing children, giving details of which floor they lived on in collapsed buildings, expressing hope they may have been rescued and taken to hospital.. Surviving relatives and health ministry officials have been travelling between medical centres trying to find them. . In the Adana hospital, the wounded keep coming. They are shocked and exhausted.. Everyone here is a survivor, patients and medics alike.. Dr Keskin lost relatives to the earthquake and sheltered in the hospital with her children as aftershocks struck.. I ask her how she is coping.. \"I'm good, I'm trying to be good, because [the children] really need us. . \"But I say thank God, I still have my children.
