        "content": "He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year.. He was captain of the Thai boys' football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. . His grinning face, caught by the torch light of a diver after the boys were found in the cave, was one of the most memorable images from the rescue. . It is not known how the teenager died, but Leicestershire Police said his death is not being treated as suspicious. Reports in Thailand said he suffered a head injury.. Promthep was driven by ambulance to Kettering General Hospital on Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson for East Midlands Ambulance Service said. An air ambulance was also sent to the scene.. In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Promthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Market Harborough. . \"Today my dream has come true,\" he wrote. . Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. . News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. . \"May Dom's soul rest in peace,\" said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks.. Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. . \"You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it,\" wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Promthep in 2018.. \"When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. . \"Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together.\" . Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: \"Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream... if the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom.\". Principal of Brooke House College, Ian Smith, said they were \"deeply saddened and shaken\" by the death.. \"We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college's global family,\" he said.. In a . , British Ambassador to Thailand Mark Gooding passed on \"his condolences to all his friends and family.\". Promthep studied in Vachiralai Bee School in Chiang Mai before he went to the UK. A diehard football fan, he had been a member of a youth team in Chiang Mai.. His Instagram account is filled with posts on the sport, often accompanied with the hashtag #footballismylife. . One of his last posts in January shows a sketch of his \"dream team's football kit\" - jersey, shorts, socks and shoes with blue and pink stripes. . After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Promthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave on their bicycles. It was one of the team's favourite haunts.. But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave system to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. . They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. . Promthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25.. The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. . Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue. They were eventually brought out after being sedated with the drug ketamine.. The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year..

        "content": "The other 28 defendants were also acquitted - among them Moroccan dancer Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, who figured in an earlier Berlusconi case.. Berlusconi has faced many court cases.. In the Ruby case, the right-wing senator won an appeal against his conviction for paying for sex with an underage prostitute. Ruby and he both denied having had sex and she denied having ever been a prostitute.. In his various court cases, he has denied wrongdoing, accusing prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him. He insisted the parties - described by some as \"orgies\" - were actually elegant dinners.. The only Berlusconi trial that ended in a conviction was his sentencing for tax fraud in 2013. Given his age, Italian justice treated him leniently - he did a year of community service at a care home near Milan.. Berlusconi was prime minister three times between 1994 and 2011. He was accused of giving witnesses millions of euros in hush money in the \"bunga-bunga\" trial, but said the money was given as compensation for reputational damage to people linked to the notorious parties.. He was temporarily barred from political office over his conviction for tax fraud, but won a seat in the Senate in 2022 elections.. His Forza Italia party plays a key role in Italy's ruling right-wing coalition, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. She hailed his acquittal as \"excellent news that puts an end to a long legal case that also had important repercussions on Italian political and institutional life\".. ",

        "content": ".. Officials said they would ensure the ancient monument and the transport links leading to it were safe.. Protests continue in the capital, Lima, and other regions in the south.. Tourism is key to Peru's economy and the losses caused by the ongoing political crisis are estimated to amount to more than $6m (Â£5m).. Train services to Machu Picchu resumed last week with a limited service. They had been suspended after protesters had placed boulders on the line. . While the situation around the ancient sanctuary high in the Andes has relaxed somewhat, other regions continue to suffer from major disruption. . The political crisis erupted on 7 December when the then-president, Pedro Castillo, tried to dissolve Congress before it could hold a vote on whether to impeach him.. Congress defied the president and proceeded with his impeachment, removing Mr Castillo from office and swearing in his vice-president, Dina Boluarte, as the country's new leader.. At first, Ms Boluarte said she would serve out the presidential term begun by Mr Castillo in full - until July 2026. But with violent protests sweeping through the country, she urged lawmakers to bring the election forward.. Congress agreed to move it to April 2024, but this concession failed to quell the protests, which have turned deadly.. Since the start of the crisis, 60 people have been killed in clashes between the security forces and demonstrators, according to the office of Peru's ombudsman.. President Boluarte has tried to convince Congress to give in to protesters' demands for elections to be held even earlier but the deeply divided legislative body has so far refused.. Meanwhile, anger on the streets has been growing with many demanding the immediate resignation of Ms Boluarte and fresh elections for president and Congress this year. Some also want to see constitutional reform.. With some of the protests moving to the centre of political power in Lima, the local authorities have banned gatherings in several of the city's main squares. . On Tuesday, President Boluarte extended a state of emergency in the capital, the province of Callao, and the country's major highways by another 30 days. . ",

        "content": "Rescue helicopters there had rescued about 300 people stranded on rooftops.  . Meanwhile, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake was widely felt across the country late on Wednesday. . There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which struck off the coast of the North Island near the capital Wellington.. The cyclone has moved away from New Zealand but about 10,500 people were still displaced on Wednesday.. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said there were also \"several people missing for whom the police do hold grave concerns.\". While the rain has ceased in most parts, many remote towns and areas remain cut off by high floodwaters and a lack of power.. New Zealand's prime minister Chris Hipkins has called Gabrielle the biggest weather event to hit the country in the past century. It's estimated to affect at least a third of the country's five million population.. The storm's damage has been most extensive in coastal communities on the far north and east coast of the North Island - with areas like Hawke's Bay, Coromandel and Northland among the worst hit.. The situation in Hawke's Bay, a popular tourist destination with some remote towns, was of particular concern to authorities, said Emergency Management Minister Kieran McAnulty.. As the cyclone hit on Monday night, residents in Hawke's Bay had been forced to swim through bedroom windows as the water level rose.. \"In some cases, flood waters were up to the second storey of homes where people were being rescued,\" a military spokesperson said. . At least three people have died in the area. One woman was killed in a landslide at her home, while another person was found dead on the shoreline, authorities said. Police said they believed the child was caught in rising water.. The body of a missing firefighter who had been caught in a landslide in west of Auckland was also found on Tuesday.. Mr McAnulty on Wednesday said it would be unsurprising if the death toll rose further.. But he hailed the \"phenomenal\" effort of rescue workers who plucked \"roughly 300 people from rooftops\" in Hawke's Bay, with 60 people rescued from one large building marooned by floodwaters.. This video can not be played. Watch: Helicopters reach flood-hit homes and assess cyclone devastation. On Wednesday, more than 140,000 people across the island were still without power, although electricity had been restored to 80,000 homes. . Residents in hard-hit areas are also being asked to conserve water and food because of fears of shortages.. New Zealand announced a national state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows it streamline its response to the disaster.. The country has only previously declared a national state of emergency on two occasions - during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.. New Zealand's climate minister has attributed to the scale of the disaster to climate change.. \"The severity of it, of course, [is] made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees,\" said James Shaw in parliament on Tuesday.. \"We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.\". Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand's North Island just two weeks after record downpours and flooding in the same region. Four people died in those floods.. ",

Ponomarenko was detained last April, weeks after the bombing, for posting that Russian warplanes had carried out the attack even though the Russian defence ministry had denied it.. She is one of a growing number of Russian dissidents jailed for criticising the war in Ukraine.. Some 1,200 civilians were seeking shelter inside the theatre when it was bombed by Russian fighter jets. Ukrainian authorities believe 300 people were killed but an Associated Press investigation said the number was closer to 600. Many of the bodies were found in the basement.. Amnesty International said it was a war crime carried out by Russian forces and the international monitoring group .  that a Ukrainian battalion had blown up the theatre.. Prosecutors said Maria Ponomarenko had committed a criminal offence brought in within days of the invasion of spreading \"knowingly false information\" about the Russian armed forces.. Addressing the court ahead of her sentence she stressed that under Russia's constitution she had done nothing wrong: \"Had I committed a real crime then it would be possible to ask for leniency, but again, due to my moral and ethical qualities, I would not do this.\". Declaring herself a patriotic, opposition pacifist, she ended her address by saying: \"No totalitarian regime has ever been as strong as before its collapse.\". The journalist and activist, who has two young children, has suffered mental health problems in jail, according to her lawyer, and last year compared her conditions in pre-trial detention to torture.. Last summer, Moscow councillor Alexei Gorinov was jailed for seven years after he was filmed speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine in a city council meeting. Earlier this week a UN working group called for his release, concluding that his detention was arbitrary and contravened the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.. In December one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years for spreading \"fake news\" about the military after he went on YouTube to condemn the killing of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians by Russian occupying forces in Bucha, near Kyiv. .
