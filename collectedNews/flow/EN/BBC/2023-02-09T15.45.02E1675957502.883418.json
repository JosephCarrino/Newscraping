        "content": "But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions - breaking policies set out by SpaceX.. A Ukrainian official said companies had to choose which \"side\" they were on.. They could join Ukraine and \"the right to freedom\", or pick Russia and \"its 'right' to kill and seize territories\", tweeted presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.. At an event in Washington DC on Wednesday, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell explained that Starlink technology was \"never meant to be weaponised\".. She made reference to Ukraine's alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use.. Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow's own drone attacks.. Russia has been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.. Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology \"for comms\", but said her intent was \"never to have them use it for offensive purposes\".. She said the company had taken steps to \"limit\" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details. . The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year. . After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media.. The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected.. They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit.. As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments.. In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position.. In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work. . \"SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,\" he wrote. . \"However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don't part.\" . ",

        "content": "Leader Kim Jong-un was seen at the midnight parade with his young daughter elevated to his side.. Kim Ju-ae's appearance has fuelled speculation she's being positioned as the successor.. The number of long-range missiles shown in the parade has prompted concern. Analysts say such a number of the missiles - which can in theory hit as far as the US mainland - could potentially overwhelm US nuclear defences if each missile carried multiple war heads.. North Korea's media did not provide detail, but said such an arsenal demonstrated the country's \"mighty war deterrence and counterattack capabilities\".. Pictures published by North Korean media on Thursday morning appeared to show more than a dozen ICBMs rolling through the central square of Pyongyang - accompanied by an army of foot solders.. Some North Korea analysts said the display also included a new ICBM launcher which appeared to design to accommodate a solid-fuel missile. . Solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which are hard to defend against. . However, Kim's regime has never successfully tested long-range solid-fuel missiles.. \"This is one of North Korea's major nuclear modernisation goals,\" said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.. \"We should expect to see the first flight tests of longer-range solid fuel missiles in the coming months,\" he told the BBC.. He added the expansion of North Korea's ICBM arsenal presented potentially \"serious military planning challenges\" for the US in a conflict, as it would be difficult for the US to find and destroy all of North Korea's mobile ICBMs.. The parade comes after a record year of missile testing by North Korea in breach of UN economic sanctions. That has led to several flare-ups of tensions on the Korean peninsula.. The state's Korean Central News Agency reported the parade stressed the country's ability to face down its enemies \"nuke for nuke, confrontation for confrontation\".. Images published showed Mr Kim clad in a black coat and fedora inspecting rows of soldiers holding bayonets, and saluting as troops and missile units paraded past. . He was also photographed observing the parade from a balcony with Ju-ae by his side.. The elevation of Ju-ae - who is believed to be about 10 years old - has been another key talking point for observers.. State media photographs showed her taking centre stage at a pre-parade banquet with military leaders, where she was seated in the centre between Mr Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju, a spot usually given to her father.. The trio were pictured smiling and flanked by top military commanders. Ms Ri was also seen wearing a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a Hwasong-17 ICBM, North Korea's largest missile which was test-launched last year.. While some analysts say this points to Ju-ae as Mr Kim's heir apparent, others say the state may be portraying the North Korean leader as a \"family man\".. \"The inclusion of Kim's daughter in the banquet was difficult to miss. North Korea's state propagandists are clearly try to portray Kim Jong-un as a family man, but the exclusion of his other reported daughter is curious,\" said Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at Stimson Center who focuses on North Korea.. Kim Jong-un reportedly has at least three children, including an elder son and a younger daughter. Ju-ae is believed to be his second child.. She only made her first appearance in public three months ago in November, when her father took her to the launch of a major ICBM launch.. While succession positioning may ultimately be the case, it is \"too early\" to arrive at the conclusion, Mr Williams told the BBC.. Mr Panda said Ju-ae's prominence in recent months could indicate that Kim expects his country's nuclear enterprise to become a multi-generational affair. . ",

        "content": "He called for a ceasefire and condemned Russia's \"illegal\" invasion, but also denounced \"provocateurs\" in the West who he claimed were responsible.. Ukrainian ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya called Waters' speech \"another brick in the wall\" of Russian disinformation.. Russia asked Waters to address the 15-member Security Council following . , in which he praised Vladimir Putin's leadership.. However, the 79-year-old singer, who appeared with his dog, surprised his sponsors by modifying his position on the war.. \"The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation was illegal. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\" he said via video link.. \"Also, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was not unprovoked, so I also condemn the provocateurs in the strongest possible terms.\". Rather than representing the view of Russia, the musician said he was speaking on behalf of \"four billion or so brothers and sisters\" - the majority of Earth's population.. He continued: \"So what do the voiceless millions have to say? They say thank you for hearing us today. We are many who do not share in the profits of the war industry.. \"We do not willingly raise our sons and daughters to provide fodder for your cannons.. \"In our opinion, the only sensible course of action today is to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Not one more Ukrainian or Russian life is to be spent, not one, they are all precious in our eyes.\". Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, glossed over the musician's reference to the illegality of the invasion. . The diplomat complimented his \"very precise analysis of events\" and reiterated his belief that the West was waging war against his country.. Other members were less enamoured by the speech.. The deputy UN ambassador for the US, Richard Mills, said: \"I certainly acknowledge he has impressive credentials as a recording artist. His qualifications to speak to us as an expert briefer on arms control or European security issues seem less evident to me.\". Ukraine's Mr Kyslytsya referenced Pink Floyd lyrics in his response, noting that the band had once been outlawed by the Soviet Union for protesting against its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.. \"It is ironic, if not hypocritical, that Mr Waters attempts now to whitewash another invasion,\" said Mr Kyslytsya. . \"How sad for his former fans to see him accepting the role of just another brick in the wall - the wall of Russian disinformation and propaganda.\". President Putin has repeatedly blamed Nato's expansion and Ukraine's push to join it for the invasion. But Eastern European countries sought to join the defensive alliance as a protective measure against Russia, while Sweden and Finland applied to join only after the February 2022 invasion.. Albania's UN representative, Ferit Hoxha, noted how Waters' former bandmates had released a song in support of Ukraine last year.. That release deepened the already-cavernous rift between Waters and Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour.. In his interview with Berliner Zeitung, Waters said: \"I find it really, really sad. It encourages the continuation of the war. . \"Pink Floyd is a name I used to be associated with... To associate that name now with something like this proxy war makes me sad.\". In response to that statement, and Waters' proclamations about Israel in recent years, Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, tweeted this week that Waters is \"a Putin apologist\" as well as \"anti-Semitic to your rotten core\".. Gilmour endorsed his wife's statement, adding: \"Every word demonstrably true.\". Waters called Samson's comments \"incendiary and wildly inaccurate\", and said he refutes them \"entirely\".. In a further deterioration of relations, Waters .  he has re-recorded Pink Floyd's iconic 1973 album The Dark Side Of The Moon, to reclaim it from his old band.. \"I wrote The Dark Side of the Moon,\" he said. \"Let's get rid of all this 'we' crap. Of course we were a band - there were four of us, we all contributed - but it's my project and I wrote it, so, blah.\". According to the official credits on the album, Waters wrote all the lyrics and contributed music to five of the 10 tracks.. In his Telegraph interview, the musician tore into his bandmates, including late keyboardist Rick Wright, claiming they \"can't write\" lyrics.. \"Well, Nick [Mason, drummer] never pretended. But Gilmour and Rick? They can't write songs, they've nothing to say. . \"They are not artists. They have no ideas - not a single one between them. They never have had, and that drives them crazy.\".

        "content": "The shipment had been due before the disaster, which caused damage to roads and temporarily halted deliveries.. Local rescuers expressed disappointment at the failure to deliver the equipment they need to save lives.. \"The UN aid... is the regular and periodic assistance that has been occurring since before the earthquake,\" tweeted the White Helmets, an organisation whose volunteer first responders operate in the region.. \"It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble.\". The White Helmets have reported at least 1,930 deaths since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in the early hours of Monday. . They have warned that the figure is likely to rise significantly because hundreds of families are still trapped beneath 418 destroyed and more than 1,300 partially destroyed buildings.. This video can not be played. Watch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horror. On Thursday morning, as the window to find survivors narrowed, the White Helmets said the lack of heavy machinery was significantly hampering their work and appealed to the international community for help.. Harsh winter weather conditions have also complicated the operation, while major power outages have resulted in fuel shortages at hospitals overwhelmed by the 2,950 injured survivors.. \"The situation is very bad. And there is no aid,\" Ibrahim Khalil Menkaween told Reuters news agency in the town of Jindayris.. The 56-year-old, who lost seven members of his family including his wife, was waiting next to the remains of his home with a body bag to give to rescuers. . \"I'm holding this bag for when they bring out my brother, and my brother's young son, and both of their wives,\" he explained.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people trapped - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive in the opposition-held north-west, which is controlled by a jihadist alliance and Turkish-backed rebel factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.. Last year, about 600 lorries carrying aid crossed from Turkey each month via Bab al-Hawa, the only border crossing that the UN is authorised to use. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of so-called \"cross-line\" aid.. The UN special envoy for Syria said on Thursday that earthquake-affected regions of the country had received \"nowhere near enough\" lifesaving aid and warned that assistance must not be \"politicised\".. \"We need it urgently through the fastest, most direct and most effective routes. They need more of absolutely everything,\" Geir Pedersen told reporters in Geneva.. He was speaking after a meeting of the UN's humanitarian task force for Syria, which includes Russia and Iran, whose forces have backed the Syrian government in the country's 12-year civil war, as well as Turkey, the United States and the European Union, which support the opposition.. The UN top aid official in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih, has said the country is experiencing a \"crisis on top of a crisis\", with 10.9 million people affected by earthquake nationwide.. Aid from countries including Iran, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Egypt, India and Venezuela has already reached government-controlled areas, where the health ministry says at least 1,260 people have been killed. . The government has suggested that lifting US and EU economic sanctions would help to speed up its emergency response. However, the EU has said the sanctions do not prohibit the export of food, medicines or medical equipment.. ",

        "content": "He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels.. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move.. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives.. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing.. The chief of Mr Zelensky's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, said cryptically that the question of long-range weaponry and fighter jets had been resolved. Mr Zelensky said only that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public.. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had. . Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act \"within the entire formation of Nato\", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly.. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years.. \"Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,\" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the \"biggest anti-European force of the modern world\". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine.. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table.. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be \"game-changers\" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, \"the quicker this Russian aggression will end\", he explained.. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not.. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France \"determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights\". Chancellor Scholz added: \"The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war.\". Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results.. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was \"very little time\" to provide much-needed weaponry.. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. \"The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,\" Mr Rutte told the BBC.. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls \"provocations\".  . Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict.. \"We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,\" said Mr Peskov.. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a \"public bidding war\" of weapons systems for Ukraine.. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: \"Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.\" . Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was \"a long-term solution\" and that training pilots could take years..
