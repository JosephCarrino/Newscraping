        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. The vessel broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. Migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran were on board.. A baby was among the dead, Italian officials said.. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who visited the scene, said as many as 30 people may still be missing. . Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . The exact number of people who were on the boat, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is not clear. . Rescue workers told the AFP news agency that the vessel had been carrying \"more than 200 people\", which would mean more than 60 people unaccounted for. . Many of the migrants were fleeing very difficult conditions, Italy's president said.. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif referenced reports that more than two dozen Pakistanis were among the dead, and called the news \"deeply concerning and worrisome\". He instructed Pakistan's diplomats to \"ascertain facts as early as possible\".. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, told Rai News. . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived. . According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

        "content": "The electoral commission has apologised for the unresponsiveness of the results viewing page on its website, saying a surge in use caused technical hitches.. The delays are partly a result of the election continuing for a second day in parts of the country.. The election on Saturday saw voting start several hours late in many areas, and also attacks on some polling stations.. More than 87 million people were eligible to take part, making it the biggest democratic exercise in Africa.. The election has seen an unprecedented challenge to the two-party system that has dominated Nigeria for 24 years. . Peter Obi from the previously little known Labour Party, Bola Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are all seen as potential winners. There are 15 other presidential candidates.. The only result officially declared so far is from the south-western Ekiti state which saw a clear victory for Mr Tinubu in one of his strongholds.. The earliest a winner has been announced is on the third day after voting in the previous two elections, but many had expected a faster conclusion this time because of the introduction of an electronic result transmission system.. This was meant to increase transparency and make sure the results could not be altered by creating a digital version on the website of the electoral commission, Inec.. But many voters have accused electoral officials of refusing to upload the results at the polling units as they are supposed to.. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results.. There have also been reports of disturbances at Inec collation centres in some states, with some political parties on Sunday asking their supporters to go to such places to protect their votes.. This video can not be played. Voters making sure the ballots cast are counted. ",

It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko's government. .

        "content": "Michelle Yeoh was named best actress, beating frontrunner Cate Blanchett.. \"This is not just for me, it's for every little girl who looks like me,\" Yeoh said in her emotional acceptance speech.. Her co-star Ke Huy Quan became the first Asian winner of best supporting actor, while there was a shock win for his co-star Jamie Lee Curtis in the supporting actress category.. Everything Everywhere All At Once follows a laundrette owner - played by Yeoh - who must tap into different versions of herself from the multiverse in order to save the world. . The sci-fi adventure's victory gives it significant momentum ahead of the Oscars on 12 March, and indicates it is the clear frontrunner to win best picture. Its four SAG awards are the most ever won by single film.. There was only one winner in SAG's film acting categories who was not from Everything Everywhere All At Once - Brendan Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale.. In her speech, Yeoh told the audience - which was largely made up of fellow actors - that \"we're here because we love what we do, we will never stop doing what we do\".. \"Thank you for giving me a seat at the table, because so many of us need this, we want to be seen, we want to be heard, and tonight you have shown us that it is possible,\" she said.. The prize for best film cast is seen as the top honour at the SAG Awards in the absence of a best picture category. Winners at the annual ceremony, held in Los Angeles, are voted for by other actors.. Veteran actor James Hong, 94, who plays Yeoh's father in Everything Everywhere, gave a comical acceptance speech, in which he vowed to return to the ceremony when he was 100 years old.. \"I got my first SAG card 70 years ago. Back in those days... producers said that Asians were not good enough and they are not box office - but look at us now,\" he said to cheers from the audience.. The film's SAG honour was the second major accolade it achieved this weekend. On Saturday, it won . , another valuable indicator of Academy Awards success.. In her own acceptance speech, Curtis said: \"I love acting, I love the job we get to do, I love being a part of a crew, part of a cast, I love what we do with each other, it's such a beautiful job... what a dream.\". Curtis, who is the daughter of two actors, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, also made light of .  about stars who arguably had an advantage in their careers because they have famous parents.. \"I know you look at me and think 'well, nepo baby, that's why she's there', and I get it,\" Curtis said. \"But the truth of the matter is, I'm 64 years old and this is just amazing.\" The actress .  as a \"nepo baby\" earlier in the ceremony.. Her victory, together with that of Kerry Condon at last week's Baftas, casts significant doubt over the supporting actress category ahead of the Oscars. Wakanda Forever's Angela Bassett had previously been considered the most likely winner. . Curtis's co-star Ke Huy Quan scored a historic victory as he was named best supporting actor, becoming . \"When I heard that, I quickly realised that this moment no longer belongs to just me. It also belongs to everyone who has asked for change,\" Quan said as he collected his trophy. \"This is a really emotional moment for me.\". Quan rose to fame as a child star in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but he took a break from acting later in his career until returning with Everything Everywhere All At Once.. \"When I stepped away from acting, it's because there were so few opportunities,\" he said. \"And yet here we are tonight, the landscape looks so different now than before. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes.\" . Elsewhere, Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale, beating Austin Butler, the young actor who has triumphed at several other precursor ceremonies for his performance as Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann's biopic.. \"I will treasure this but never more than what I used to keep in my wallet, which was my SAG card, that I earned in 1991,\" Fraser recalled, becoming visibly emotional. \"It made me feel like I belonged. If you told that guy back then, that I'd be standing here right now, I would not have believed you.\". He described the role of Charlie, the morbidly obese professor he portrays in The Whale, as \"the role of my life\".. Fraser's win continues a hugely successful comeback for the actor, who was a box office star at the turn of the millennium with films such as The Mummy and George of the Jungle.. But the 54-year-old then spent several years out of the spotlight, taking on smaller roles as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, until he was cast as the lead in Darren Aronofsky's film.. \"I just want you to know, all the actors out there who have gone through that or are going through that, I know how you feel, but believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go,\" Fraser said.. In the TV categories, acting winners included Jessica Chastain (for George & Tammy), Jason Bateman (Ozark), Sam Elliott (1883) and Jean Smart (Hacks). . The top two TV prizes - best drama series and best comedy series - were won by wealth satire The White Lotus and school-based sitcom Abbott Elementary respectively.. The White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge, who won best actress in a drama series, used her acceptance speech to recount the story of when her usually rule-abiding father let her skip school to attend the Charlie Chaplin film festival. . \"He got me out of my first grade class to do it,\" she said, \"and seeing Charlie Chaplin for the first time and having that experience, my love of film, my love of actors, all of that came from my first grade.\". Andrew Garfield presented the lifetime achievement award to Sally Field, who told the crowd: \"In all of these almost 60 years there is not a day that I don't feel quietly thrilled to call myself an actor.\". Famous faces including Robbie Coltrane, Ray Liotta, James Caan, Dame Olivia Newton John, Irene Cara, Annie Wersching and Dame Angela Lansbury also featured in the show's In Memoriam segment.. The SAG Awards and the Bafta Film Awards are both seen as Oscar indicators - but this year, none of the major winners overlapped.. Last week's Baftas were instead dominated by The Banshees of Inisherin and All Quiet On The Western Front, while Everything Everywhere took only one of the 10 awards it was nominated for.. It leaves the awards race wide open ahead of the Oscars, with no actor this year having won their category across the Golden Globes, Critics Choice, SAG Awards and Baftas.. ",

        "content": "On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine's security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president's life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.. But Ukraine's leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as \"manipulation\" and called on everyone to remain calm.. Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. \"We expected it on 22 February,\" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia's initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. . \"Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.\". If the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow's plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?. A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.. Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.. Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: \"But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.\". The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine's general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia's invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine's defence.. Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.. It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. . As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.. That indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.. \"How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?\" Lt Palchenko explains. \"Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.\". Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv's defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. . When Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. \"When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn't put together a map,\" he said.  . He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  . They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.. Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. . \"My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.\"  . The Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.. The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country's top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.. Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.. \"[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,\" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. \"We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank 'hedgehogs' - in half a day, it was all done.\". Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.. \"We stopped Russia's forces because the people rose up,\" he adds.. ",
