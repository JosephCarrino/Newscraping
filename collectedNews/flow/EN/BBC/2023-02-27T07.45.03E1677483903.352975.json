        "content": "On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine's security council Aleksey Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president's life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.. But Ukraine's leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as \"manipulation\" and called on everyone to remain calm.. Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. \"We expected it on 22 February,\" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia's initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. . \"Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.\". If the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow's plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?. A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.. Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.. Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: \"But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.\". The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine's general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia's invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine's defence.. Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.. It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. . As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Evgeniy Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.. That indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.. \"How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?\" Lt Palchenko explains. \"Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.\". Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytriy Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv's defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. . When Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. \"When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn't put together a map,\" he said.  . He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  . They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.. Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. . \"My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.\"  . The Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.. The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country's top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.. Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.. \"[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,\" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. \"We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank 'hedgehogs' - in half a day, it was all done.\". Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.. \"We stopped Russia's forces because the people rose up,\" he adds.. ",

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador accuses the INE of being partisan.. But opponents describe the recent vote as an attack on democracy itself, pressing the Supreme Court to overturn them as unconstitutional.. On Sunday, massive crowds gathered in Mexico City's historic Zocalo Square. The demonstrators spilled out into adjoining streets in the city centre.. \"We're fighting to defend our democracy,\" protester Veronica Echevarria was quoted as saying by Reuters. She was wearing a cap emblazoned with the words \"Hands off the INE\". Many demonstrators carried cards with a similar slogan.. Smaller peaceful demonstrations were staged in several other cities.. , following a similar vote in the lower chamber of parliament. The reforms will come into force once they are signed by President López Obrador.. The BBC's Mexico correspondent, Will Grant, says it is perhaps the most polemic political issue in Mexico at present. . Mr López Obrador, who was elected in July 2018 after two previous failed attempts, has long been critical of the INE, whose staff oversee elections.. Last month, he accusing the independent body of cheating, and said its staff turned a blind eye to \"the stuffing of ballot boxes, falsification of [election] records and vote buying\". . In his first attempt at becoming president, in 2006, he lost to his conservative rival Felipe Calderón by less than one percentage point.  For months, Mr López Obrador refused to recognise the result, which he denounced as fraudulent. . He also challenged the result of the 2012 election, when he lost to Enrique Peña Nieto.. Since his win in 2018, Mr López Obrador has been pushing for a reform of the INE, which he says will save taxpayers $150m (£125m) a year by drastically reducing the agency's staff.. ",

        "content": "Watch: On board with Ukraine's attack helicopter pilots. For helicopter pilots in war-time Ukraine, there is little margin for error. . Just ask Roman. . He has flown countless combat missions for Ukraine's Sikorsky Brigade and been decorated for valour. He tells us his age - 34 - but not his last name.  . \"The closer to the target, the lower we fly. It's one or two metres above ground,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's not enough just to strike the target. You have to come back safe and bring your crew and helicopter back safely for the next mission.\"  . Over the past year some of his fellow pilots have not made it back.. We were given rare access to Ukraine's war in the skies at an air strip on a patch of open ground. We can't say where it is - if Russia could identify the location, it would be a major target. . We watch Roman take off for his latest sortie on Ukraine's eastern front with our camera in the cockpit. His helicopter is followed by two others; their blades slice the air beneath a muddy grey sky.  . Below them a Ukrainian trench zigzags across the landscape, and a village lays deserted. . They speed across a frozen lake as if skating on ice. Half an hour later they return, having unleashed 80 missiles.    . Roman comes in to land circling low enough over our heads for us to see him wave from the window. He's renowned among fellow airmen in his brigade for executing difficult manoeuvres - a Ukrainian top gun in an ageing Soviet aircraft.  . His Mi-8 helicopter is about as old as he is, and lacks heavy armour, or modern warning systems about incoming missiles.  Every mission could be his last.. \"Of course, there is some risk,\" he says after touching down. \"I just don't think about this. If it happens, it will not be my problem, it will be a problem for my relatives\". It sounds like a joke, but his expression is concealed by his balaclava.. He will not disclose his target, but chances are it was . .. \"It was just an ordinary mission. You concentrate 100% on your task,\" he says. \"You think of your guys waiting for you on the ground. They are really striving if they call for aviation.\" . What he doesn't think about is the Russian troops on the receiving end.   . \"If they came here with war,\" he tells me, \"we are just protecting our country. We are not aggressors.  We are the victim. And if to win this war we should kill Russian soldiers, we are ready to kill them all.\". As soon as the helicopters land, maintenance crews converge, refuelling and rearming the aircraft to be ready for the next flight.. The missiles are loaded by hand. One is inscribed with a crude message to Russian troops. . Within minutes Roman has co-ordinates for a new target and is wheels up again. . He says Ukraine can't win this war with the Soviet equipment it's got. . A spokesman for his brigade spells it out.  . \"We need new helicopters with navigation equipment, high precision weapons and ammunition,\" he tells us. \"We need everything.\". Add this to the fighter jets already requested by President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it's a long list for what may be a long war. . When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded last year, Roman was part of a Ukrainian peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now this former peacekeeper sees a danger of endless conflict with Russia.. \"Just look back at our history,\" he says. \"We have always had problems with our neighbour. When we win this one if they don't change, they will come back to attack us again, in years or in decades.\". ",

Migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran were on board.. A baby was among the dead, Italian officials said.. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who visited the scene, said as many as 30 people may still be missing. . Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . The exact number of people who were on the boat, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is not clear. . Rescue workers told the AFP news agency that the vessel had been carrying \"more than 200 people\", which would mean more than 60 people unaccounted for. . Many of the migrants were fleeing very difficult conditions, Italy's president said.. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif referenced reports that more than two dozen Pakistanis were among the dead, and called the news \"deeply concerning and worrisome\". He instructed Pakistan's diplomats to \"ascertain facts as early as possible\".. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, told Rai News. . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived. . According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

Following widespread delays and attacks on some polling stations on Saturday, voting was postponed until Sunday in parts of the country.. Voting continued through the night in some areas.. Turnout appears to be high, especially among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters.. This makes it the biggest democratic exercise in Africa.. The election has seen an unprecedented challenge to the two-party system that has dominated Nigeria for 24 years.. Peter Obi from the previously little known Labour Party, Mr Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are all seen as potential winners. There are 15 other presidential candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. Saturday's voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, as well as scattered reports of ballot-box snatching and attacks by armed men, especially in southern areas, where Mr Obi has strong backing. . Dr Nkem Okoli was just about to vote in the Lekki district of the biggest city Lagos when masked men attacked the polling station.. \"There was pandemonium. There were bottles flying everywhere,\" she told the BBC. \"They broke [the ballot box]. They stole the phones of the officials. Now we can't vote.\". In some areas, voting did not begin until around 18:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after polls were due to close.. First-time voter Susan Ekpoh told the BBC that she spent 13 hours at her polling station in the capital, Abuja, only leaving at midnight.. She said when it got dark, election officials said they needed light to see what they were doing, so she and others . The southern Bayelsa state was among those areas where voting was delayed until Sunday - it is not clear how many parts of the country saw voting postponed.. Harrison Rosaline said she waited for five hours to vote on Saturday in Bayelsa's capital, Yenagoa, without seeing any election officials. But she returned, with her two-week old baby, and is delighted to have finally cast her ballot.. \"I was motivated because I want a better Nigeria. I want this country to be good for everybody, including my baby,\" she told the BBC.. There is tension in parts of Rivers and Lagos states, where some political parties have asked their members to go to the centres where votes are being collated, to prevent them being manipulated.. There have also been complaints over the use of the recently introduced electronic voting system, with many voters accusing electoral officials of refusing to upload the results at the polling units as they are supposed to.. However, in those areas where voting went smoothly, results are being posted outside individual polling stations.. This video can not be played. Voters making sure the ballots cast are counted. The results from tens of thousands of polling stations around the country are being added up. An official from the electoral body in each of Nigeria's 36 states will then travel to the capital, Abuja, where the results will be announced state-by-state.. Final results are not expected before Monday at the earliest, and possibly not until Wednesday.. At a press briefing on Saturday, electoral chief Mahmood Yakubu apologised for the delays in voting.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. Whoever wins will have to deal with a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives.. Mr Obi, 61, enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the largely Christian south.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted because one of the two traditional parties is more likely to win.. The PDP's Mr Abubakar, 76, is the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Mr Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Lagos during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies..
