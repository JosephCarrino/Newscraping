        "content": "The losses are the third biggest in French corporate history and the worst for more than 20 years.. EDF's debts have spiralled to €64.5bn.. The losses are in marked contrast to EDF's UK-based business, which made an underlying profit of £1.12bn supplying electricity and gas to five million households.. In France, President Emmanuel Macron's government responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing a tariff \"shield\" for consumers, limiting energy companies to a 4% rise in 2022 followed by 15% in 2023, keeping inflation lower than in other European countries.. But it meant that EDF had to sell power to French consumers at a loss, while UK consumers paid far more for their energy. EDF has around 80% of France's electricity market.. French industry has not seen such poor results since 2002, when Vivendi Universal and France Telecom both posted losses above €20bn for the previous year.. EDF has never before reported such large losses. . \"The 2022 results were significantly affected by the decline in our electricity output, and also by exceptional regulatory measures introduced in France in difficult market conditions,\" said Chief Executive Luc Remont, who said EDF's priority was now to put the company back on track. He said core earnings would be significantly higher in 2023.. EDF's nuclear output in France fell by 30% to its lowest since 1988 as more than half of its 56 ageing nuclear power stations went offline for repairs, which had been delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. France has the biggest fleet of nuclear plants in Europe.. The outages meant that France became a net importer of electricity for the first time in decades.. EDF's financial woes have various causes, but another major factor is an obligation it has to sell a quarter of its production at a fixed price to its competitors.. The system known as Arenh (Regulated Access to Historic Nuclear Electricity) was devised in 2010 in order to satisfy the EU, which was worried about EDF - with its massive nuclear capacity - becoming a monopoly provider.. It meant the French electricity market was able to open up to competition, but EDF says it has forced the company into the absurd situation of subsidising its competitors.. In 2022 things became \"surreal\" in the words of one former CEO.  Because of the soaring cost of electricity on the European market, EDF's own generating capacity hit by technical problems, and with the government extending the low price guarantee to customers - EDF was having to buy in electricity at €100 a unit, and sell it to rivals at €46.. And many of these competitors, EDF argues, aren't real players at all but simply market traders.. Three former CEOs have described the system as \"a poison pill\" and have blamed the EU and Germany for rigging the system against France's interests.. Although the French state already controls 84% of EDF, the government has begun a process to fully nationalise the company. Major changes are likely, not least to Arenh.. President Macron has spoken of a renaissance in the nuclear industry, with plans for six new reactors to help France reach carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with EU aims.. ",

On Friday, Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that officials would further investigate the crashed balloon but would not \"jump to conclusions\".. This is the first time remnants of such a balloon have been discovered in Taiwan's offshore islands, said senior defence official Chen Yu-lin, according to local media..  in recent weeks, after the US .  in its airspace earlier this month. The US also shot down three other objects it says are unlikely to be foreign spy crafts.. The sphere found on Dongyin was about a metre in diameter and bore the name of a China-based company that, based on online searches, stocks meteorological and radio appliances.. The company Taiyuan Radio No 1 Factory Co. Ltd is based in Taiyuan, one of China's main industrial bases and capital of Shanxi province.. The sphere was also marked \"GTS13 digital atmospheric sounding instrument\" and \"meteorological instrument\", with simplified Chinese language characters, the military said in a statement.. China has used simplified Chinese characters since the 1950s, but Taiwan continues to use traditional characters.. Authorities have not released pictures of the object.. Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday that it had not detected any Chinese surveillance balloons, but it had spotted weather balloons previously. It also said it would not hesitate to shoot down any balloon it deemed a threat.. These comments came after the Financial Times reported earlier this week - citing unnamed officials - that dozens of Chinese military balloons had been spotted in Taiwan's airspace in recent years.. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. . But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.. ",

Members of the Ver.di union and Civil Service Association are demanding a 10.5% pay increase for workers. . At Leipzig Airport, a handful of international flights got away this morning but domestic flights were cancelled.. At Frankfurt Airport, a couple of passengers wheeled suitcases through what is usually the bustling departures terminal. It was, one local TV reporter noted, almost as empty as it had been during the Covid pandemic.  . The action coincided with the start of the high-profile gathering of world leaders and defence experts at the Munich Security Conference. . The arrival of prominent guests was not expected to be affected but other delegates were advised to travel by train. . Airports handling emergency aid for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria have said that those cargo flights would continue as scheduled. . But the strike - which comes two days after .  - has prompted a furious response from some German business leaders. . Representatives of small and medium business associations condemned the action as unacceptable and accused the unions of taking the whole country hostage for their own interests.. And air passengers in Germany are becoming accustomed - even resigned - to this kind of disruption. . Last summer, staff shortages led to chaotic scenes at airports as flights were delayed and cancelled and travellers queued for hours at check in and security. . A representative for Ver.di said that, unless pay and working conditions improved, those issues would continue and guarantee another turbulent summer at the country's airports.  . Lufthansa has already announced it will have to reduce its summer programme as a result of staff shortages. . Germany's unions are well organised and it's rare to see picket lines because most employees participate in strikes. But workers are expected to hold demonstrations at various airports throughout the day. . Their demands have thus far been rejected by employers who are yet to submit their own offer with talks expected to continue next week. And the leader of Ver.di, Frank Werneke, struck a threatening tone earlier.. \"The next strikes will have a different dimension,\" he said. \"Unless the employers table a good offer next week, this will be just a taste of what's to come.\".

        "content": "Mr Bao is a leading deal broker in China whose clients include top tech companies Didi and Meituan.. His firm's announcement has renewed concerns of a potential Beijing crackdown on finance and tech figures.. Shares in the investment firm plunged on Friday, after it told shareholders it had \"been unable to contact Mr Bao Fan\". The board added it was not aware of \"any information that indicates that Mr Bao's unavailability is or might be related to the business and/or operations of the group\".. When asked for further comment, China Renaissance referred the BBC to its notice to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. . The company did not specify how long Mr Bao had been missing. Chinese business newswire Caixin cited sources saying staff had not been able to contact him for two days.. The business wire also reported the firm's president, Cong Lin, had been taken by authorities last September over his previous work at the state-owned ICBC bank. . China Renaissance appears to not have commented on Mr Cong's situation. He is no longer listed as an executive on the company's site or in its most recent interim report.. The disappearance of Mr Bao - one of China's leading tech investors - has again evoked a history of Chinese executives suddenly vanishing for periods of time with no explanation.. At least half a dozen billionaires in the past few years have disappeared for periods after reported run-ins with the Communist Party, according to Forbes Magazine.. In several cases they were suspected to have been ensnared in corruption, tax or other misconduct investigations.. Notable absences include that of Fosun group founder Guo Guangchang, who has been called the Warren Buffet of China, who vanished for several days in 2015. . Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China's richest people and . In late 2020, .  for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.. Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China's tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.. His company was behind landmark deals including Tencent's strategic investment in JD.com, and mergers of ride-hailing power players Didi and Kuaidi, advert sites 58.com and Ganji, and food delivery giants Meituan and Dianping.. China Renaissance has also advised the initial public offerings of e-commerce sites JD.com and Kuashou, as well as Didi's listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.. In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had \"cross paths\" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.. ",
