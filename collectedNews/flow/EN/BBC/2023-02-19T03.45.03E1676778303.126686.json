        "content": "\"I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,\" he said.. But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to \"crush\" the nation.. The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.. \"I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,\" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.. \"Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.\" . Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.. But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.. The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to \"bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace\".. He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, saying similar efforts around the world as a \"total failure\".. Despite Mr Macron's comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine's leaders.. On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.. Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the \"terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics\", he said.. President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was \"no trust\" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also .  to strike a peace deal with Moscow.. Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.. Last June, he was .  for saying it was vital that Russia was not \"humiliated over its invasion\".. Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was humiliating itself - needed to be put in its place.. ",

        "content": "Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities \"will be held to account\". Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of \"gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation\" since its invasion.. World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. . UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. . The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. . Ms Harris told the conference that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. . \"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,\" she said. . The UN defines crimes against humanity as a \"widespread or systemic attack\" on a particular civilian population.. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. . \"In the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity,\" Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, told the conference. . She cited \"barbaric and inhumane\" atrocities during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found .  shortly after the invasion and the . \"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,\" Ms Harris said.. This video can not be played. Evidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha. Crimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).. But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.. Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.. The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had \"waged a genocidal war\" because it did not think Ukrainians \"deserve to exist as a sovereign nation\".. Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.. This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It's a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. . Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. . But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. . Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. . It's opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. . There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia's invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "UK PM Rishi Sunak: \"Now is the moment to double down on our military support (for Ukraine)\". Mr Sunak told the Munich Security Conference that allies must give the country \"advanced, Nato-standard capabilities\".. He said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. Throughout the conference, Ukraine's allies have reiterated the case for defending the country. . The three-day gathering to discuss global security, taking place in Germany ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion, provided a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives. . Ukraine's allies tried to demonstrate their resolve and tried to convince the Russian government that they will not give up or give in, even if the cost in \"blood and treasure\" increases in coming months.. Most of those who attended the conference - from heads of state and ministers to diplomats and spies - were from Europe or the US, including . and nearly 30 European heads of government. No Russian officials were invited. . Mr Sunak had said he wanted to \"make sure other countries follow our lead\" in providing battle tanks, and training soldiers and aviators on Nato-standard aircrafts.. In his speech in Germany, he said: \"Ukraine needs more artillery, armoured vehicles and air defences, so now is the time to double down on our military support.. \"When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter. Even now he is betting we will lose our nerve.. \"But we proved him wrong then, and we will prove him wrong now.\". Calling for a new Nato charter to provide assurances of long-term support, Mr Sunak said allies \"must demonstrate that we'll remain by their side, willing and able to help them defend their country again and again\".. He went on to say that, as well as having a military strategy \"to gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield\", allies also needed \"to rebuild the international order on which our collective security depends\".. Mr Sunak said international law needed to be upheld in order to hold Russia to account. He also called for \"a new framework\" for Ukraine's long-term security, and said the international community's response had not been strong enough against Russia's aggression.. Before his speech, Mr Sunak met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and both agreed on the need to sustain \"the record level of international support for Ukraine\", a Downing Street spokeswoman said. . Mr Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also agreed on \"the importance of giving Ukraine the military momentum they need to secure victory against tyranny\" in a meeting on the conference sidelines, said No 10.. The unspoken question in Munich was what will happen if the participants meet this time next year and the war is still going on.. Of particular concern was whether the political and economic costs of the war could prove too much to bear, as the Russian leadership assumes, or the western alliance will stand firm behind Ukraine.. The uncertainty around these issues is another reason why allies want to step up support now, to ensure Ukraine can see off any Russian offensive and launch a counter-attack on its own. President Volodymyr Zelensky is not the only one urging speed.. Last week, the Ukrainian leader visited the UK, as well as Paris and Brussels, where he appealed for European leaders to supply his country with modern fighter jets.. The UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard jets and Mr Sunak has said \"nothing is off the table\". . But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said . . . He told the BBC it could take months to train pilots and the UK was instead focused on using alternative provision of air cover to Ukraine. . Some Nato member countries are also worried that giving jets to Ukraine would be viewed as escalating the war, risking direct confrontation between the Western military alliance and Russia. . Since Russia invaded on 24 February last year, the UK has spent £2.3bn on military assistance, making the country the second biggest donor behind the US. The government has said it plans to match this spending again this year.. Military equipment provided by the UK so far includes tanks, air defence systems and artillery. . However, Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated by the time Western weapons have taken to arrive. Deliveries of battle tanks - promised last month by countries including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. During Mr Sunak's meeting with Ms Von der Leyen, the pair also had what Downing Street described as a \"positive discussion\" about fixing issues with . . . They agreed there had been \"very good progress to find solutions\" but that \"intensive work in the coming days is still needed\" to get a deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements over the line, according to No 10. . It comes after sources suggested that a deal could be reached between the UK and the European Union . , after more than a year of negotiations.. .. Use this form to ask your question: .

        "content": "But now an investigation .  has revealed more details.. According to the investigation, M'Barki ran reports on a variety of subjects - luxury yachts in Monaco, a Sudanese opposition leader, allegations of corruption in Qatar - that had all one thing in common: they were planted by an Israel-based outfit specialising in 'news for hire'.. M'Barki has denied being paid to run the stories, but he admits to bypassing BFM's editorial checks.  . He says he was offered the reports by an intermediary and exercised his own professional judgment in selecting to use them.. But the investigators say they have evidence that the origin of the stories lies in the shadowy Team Jorge, an operation based in Tel Aviv and run by a former Israeli special forces officer whose real name is Tal Hanan.. According to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories, Team Jorge is one of several players in a growing world of disinformation mercenaries - private sector experts in intelligence who for a price will use the internet to damage an enemy's reputation or influence an election.. To get access to Team Jorge, three journalists from the Forbidden Stories consortium posed as potential clients seeking to shape opinion in French-speaking Africa on behalf of a major multinational. . After lengthy negotiation they finally arranged a face-to-face meeting and got what amounted to a sales pitch.. Hanan claimed to have intervened in more than 30 elections and to have access to email and social media accounts of prominent African figures.. Central to the Team Jorge offer was a platform called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (AIMS), which generates tens of thousands of fake identities with accounts on Facebook and Telegram. These accounts then spread the content of a campaign.. The investigators identified around 20 different international campaigns which they believed Team Jorge had organised. . Among the material being circulated on social media, they especially noticed two television news reports in French that purportedly ran on BFM.. After checking with BFM's management, they had confirmation: the reports were shown late at night on the channel, but without the knowledge of the editorial team. . At that point, on January 11, M'Barki was called in and suspended.. The first of the reports was on the EU's Russia sanctions, and their impact on the luxury yacht business in Monaco. . It was claimed that 10,000 jobs were at risk and that the industry had appealed to Prince Albert to intervene on their behalf. None of that has been proved.. The second report, broadcast in mid-December, was about a leafleting campaign in Paris accusing a former state prosecutor in Qatar of corruption.. When originally shown in the early hours of the morning, the reports would have gone almost unobserved.  . But that changed when they were picked up by social media and Team Jorge's massed avatars. Suddenly they were viral.. By seemingly planting the reports onto mainstream French television, the organisers would have immeasurably boosted the credibility of what would otherwise have been unsubstantiated gossip.  . It also would mean Team Jorge had evidence for future clients of its access to western media.. M'Barki's late night show also ran items on a Sudanese general who was considering running for the presidency, and a trade show in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. . In this second piece, the name of the territory was replaced by the politically-charged term Moroccan Sahara.. The area has been the subject of .  between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.. The people or organisations that ultimately commissioned the suspected campaigns remain a mystery, according to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories.  . Some may have been commissioned by governments, but most - like the yacht story - were probably ordered by private interests, the investigation concluded.. A worrying sign, the investigators say, of the growing \"Uberisation\" of the fake news business.. ",
