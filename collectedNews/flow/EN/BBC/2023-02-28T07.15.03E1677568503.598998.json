        "content": "\"The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions\", Mr Zelensky stated.. The Ukrainian leader's remarks came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China against arming Russia during a visit to Kyiv on Monday.. Some of the fiercest fighting to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a year ago has taken place in Bakhmut, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, part of which is under the control of Russia and its separatist allies.. Recently efforts by Russian forces to capture the industrial city have intensified, with its troops gaining ground.. The separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, said \"practically all roads\" into the city were \"under [Russian] fire control\".. Speaking about the situation in his nightly address, President Zelensky said managing to gain a foothold in Bakhmut and ensuring its defence were being heavily compromised by Russia's renewed onslaught.. He was \"grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding\" the area.. President Zelensky also called once again for modern combat aircraft to be sent so that \"the entire territory of our country\" can be defended from \"Russian terror\".. On her surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, Janet Yellen announced the latest transfer of $1.25bn (£1bn) in economic and budget aid to Ukraine.. Ms Yellen reiterated US President Joe Biden's message - made during .  - that Washington would stand with Ukraine for as long as it took to win the war.. , Ms Yellen added that while Russia's economy had not yet buckled under the vast sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers, she expected it to grow weaker over time.. She also stated that Russia's ability to replenish military equipment destroyed in attacks on Ukraine was being \"gradually jeopardized\", adding that any move from China to supply such weaponry to Russia would lead to \"severe\" consequences.. \"We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,\" she said. . \"And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.\". Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said . . Beijing strongly denied the claim.. A meeting between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week looked to many to be an indication of China's close ties with Russia..

        "content": "This is the first national election where an electronic device has been used to accredit voters.. The election commission has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. The PDP representative at the election centre in Abuja described the process as fraudulent, and accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec, while the Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC, whose candidate Bola Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. With about a third of the 36 states officially declared, Mr Tinubu has 44% of votes cast, ahead of Mr Abubakar on 33%, and Mr Obi on 18%. However, many of the results yet to come are from the north and south-east, seen as strongholds of the PDP and Labour Party respectively, so the final outcome remains unpredictable.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 but this time, Mr Obi from the previously little known Labour Party is expected to mount a strong challenge to the two-party system. He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. Mr Obi has caused a major upset by winning in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, narrowly defeating Mr Tinubu in his heartland.. Mr Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and hopes to use his record there as the basis of his presidential bid.. The ruling party candidate has accepted defeat in Lagos and said that as a democrat, he was bound to accept the outcome of any election.. \"People have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice,\" he said in a statement released by his campaign team.. He also appealed for calm from his supporters after his loss, following reports of violence in parts of Lagos against traders from the Igbo community, like Mr Obi.. Mr Obi's victory in Lagos, though a major breakthrough for a third-party candidate, is not necessarily a huge surprise. The city is home to many young, educated people, as well as a large Igbo population - all groups widely seen as backing his campaign.. He has also won in his heartland eastern Enugu state.. Inec had assured Nigerians that the electronic voting system, known as Bvas, would enable it to transmit election results direct from polling stations to improve transparency.. However, there were complaints on Saturday from many voters that electoral officials refused to upload the results at the polling stations as they are supposed to.. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results.. Inec chairman Mr Yakubu has apologised for the inability of the commission to upload most of the results as promised, saying that a surge in traffic caused glitches.. ",

        "content": "Mr Murdoch's comments were revealed in a legal filing as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by ballot tech company Dominion Voting Systems.. Fox News denies defamation - saying the hosts' words were taken out of context. . \"Some of our commentators were endorsing it,\" Mr Murdoch said in a sworn deposition filed on Monday. . Asked about certain on-air claims that echoed Mr Trump's, he said: \"I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight.\". Regarding the Republican former president's allegations of widespread voter fraud, Mr Murdoch said he was doubtful.. Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6bn (£1.3bn), arguing the conservative outlet broadcast false and malicious rumours about voter fraud that harmed its business.. Fox News has argued that the comments are protected under the constitutional right to free speech, and that it was only reporting on Mr Trump's allegations, not supporting them. . In a statement provided to BBC News on Monday, Fox said Dominion's lawsuit \"mischaracterizes the facts by cherry-picking soundbites, omitting key context, and mischaracterizing the record\".. In order to prove defamation, lawyers for Dominion would have to successfully argue that Fox presented false information, and did so knowing that it was untrue. . A jury trial is expected to begin in Delaware in April. . ",
