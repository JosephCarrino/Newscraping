        "content": "Watch: \"At first I thought it was a star\". A senior State Department official said conditions were not right at this time for what would have been the first high level US-China meeting there in years.. A Chinese apology was noted, the official said, but described the balloon as a clear violation of sovereignty and international law.. The visit was to come amid fraying tensions between the US and China. America's top US diplomat was set to visit Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. . But there was consternation on Thursday when US defence officials announced they were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United States.. A senior state department official said that the balloon would have \"narrowed the agenda\" of any meetings with Chinese officials \"in a way that would have been unhelpful and unconstructive\". . While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, \"traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic\" and did \"not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground\", its presence sparked outrage.. Former US President Donald Trump was among those calling for the US military to shoot it down.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. A statement from China's Foreign Ministry said that it regretted the incident and would work with the US to resolve the issue.. However, the state department official said that while the US acknowledged China's claim about the balloon's purpose, it stood by the assessment that it was being used for surveillance. . Another trip by Mr Blinken to China would be planned \"at the earliest opportunity\"  another senior state department official said, adding that Washington planned to maintain \"open lines of communication\" about the incident. . The official added that the State Department had informed close US allies about the violation of US airspace.  . In a statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the country's foreign ministry - said that it had summoned China's ambassador over the incident and will  \"vigorously express\" its position to Chinese officials.. Mr Blinken had been expected to visit China on 5 and 6 February. . A US official quoted by the Associated Press said that the decision to abruptly halt the trip was made by Mr Blinken and President Joe Biden. . Mr Biden did not take questions about the balloon following remarks about the US economy on Friday morning. . According to US officials, the balloon flew over Alaska and Canada before appearing in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive military missile sites. . By Friday morning, the balloon was moving east \"over the centre of the continental US\" at an altitude of about 60,000 feet (18,200m) according to Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. . General Ryder added that US officials are monitoring the object and reviewing \"options\". He said the balloon - which he described as \"manoeuvrable\" - poses no military or physical threat to people on the ground. . Although fighter planes were alerted, the US decided not to shoot the object down due to the dangers of falling debris, officials said. . Several Republican lawmakers - as well as former President Donald Trump - have criticised the decision and urged the US to down the balloon. . \"Shoot down the balloon,\" Mr Trump said in a short message on his Truth Social social media platform. . On Twitter, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the balloon incident was \"a destabilizing action that must be addressed\". . While US officials have not commented on the size and details of the suspected spy balloon, Chinese officials have previously publicly expressed interest in the potential military and intelligence-gathering potential of balloons. . \"Technological advances have opened a new door for the use of balloons,\" an article in the military-run Liberation Army Daily said last year. . In 2022, Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected Chinese balloons over its territory. . ",

        "content": "Rabanne gained global fame for his eccentric clothing designs. . Puig's fashion president, José Manuel Albesa, hailed Rabanne's work, which he said \"made transgression magnetic\".. \"Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women to clamour for dresses made of plastic and metal,\" Mr Albesa said. \"That radical, rebellious spirit set him apart: There is only one Rabanne.\" . Marc Puig, chairman and chief executive officer of Puig, called Rabanne a \"major personality in fashion\" and paid tribute to his \"daring, revolutionary and provocative vision, conveyed through a unique aesthetic\". . Rabanne was born into a military family in Spain's Basque region, near the city of San Sebastian. His father was a colonel in the Republican military, who was executed by Gen Francisco Franco's nationalist forces in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. . His mother - who had worked as a seamstress for the designer Cristobal Balenciaga - moved the family to Paris in 1939 after the Nationalist forces seized Madrid and won the war. . After growing up in the French capital, Rabanne became an architecture student at l'École Nationale des Beaux-Arts, where he earned money drawing fashion sketches. . After a short period working in the construction industry with a concrete manufacturer, he launched his fashion career designing jewellery for Givenchy, Dior and Balenciaga. . Then in 1966, he launched his own eponymous fashion house - Paco Rabanne - which saw him attain international acclaim. . His designs attracted both praise and controversy, and his debut collection, entitled 12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials, enraged the French fashion press after models were decked out in sharp metals and other unlikely materials. . \"I have always had the impression of being a time accelerator,\" he said of his designs in 2016. \"Of going as far as is reasonable for one's time and not indulge in the morbid pleasure of the known things, which I view as decay.\". In 1968, he signed a deal with the Catalonia-based Puig family, who were heavyweights in the fashion and fragrance industry. The deal marked his entrance into the perfume industry, which would eventually become synonymous with his name. . His debut fragrance, Calandre, is still available today, while Lady Million - known for its colourful gold bottles - maintains its grip over the market. . His innovations extended to every aspect of his business. He was one of the first fragrance designers to launch one of his products online in the mid-1990s. . But he was also known for his provocative outbursts. At various stages he claimed to have had multiple lives, to have been some 78,000 years old, to have seen God and been visited by aliens. . And in 1999, he courted controversy after predicting in his book - Fire From Heaven - that Paris would be destroyed later that year when the Russian space station Mir crashed down to Earth. He said that he had foreseen the disaster from his reading of the 16th-Century French astrologer Nostradamus.. In 1999, after decades as one of the industry's foremost innovators, Rabanne retired from fashion. Over the next 24 years, he was rarely seen in the public eye. . In a statement on Paco Rabanne's official Instagram, the brand hailed him as a \"visionary\" and said he was \"among the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th Century\". . \"His legacy will remain a constant source of inspiration,\" it added. .

        "content": "He also warned of further deterioration due to declining international support for the Palestinian Authority (PA).. \"The UN cannot take over this responsibility, we cannot govern Palestine,\" he said.   . In the last month, more than 35 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been killed, following a year of spiralling violence involving near-nightly Israeli military search and arrest raids and a spate of Palestinian attacks.. It comes with the most radically nationalist government in Israel's history now in power, which has declared the principle of \"exclusive\" Jewish rights to all the land. . Meanwhile, a crisis-gripped PA, which governs to a limited extent parts of the West Bank, has been losing control of the cities of Jenin and Nablus to a new generation of armed militants.. Many observers fear a final demise of prospects for a so-called two-state solution - the long standing international formula for peace. . Mr Wennesland is the UN's special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process, a post created during the breakthrough Oslo agreements of the 1990s. It now sees him frequently shuttling between Israeli, Palestinian and regional officials, trying to de-escalate crises and violent flare-ups, while hopes of a longer-term peace are moribund. . Mr Wennesland accepted there were \"difficult\" diplomatic conditions, given the \"political situation… on the Israeli side\" and the \"complicated situation\" with the Palestinian leadership. . But the envoy dismissed the suggestion that the peace process was dead. . \"Whatever government we have in Israel, whatever authority we have in Ramallah, this is the point of departure where this discussion needs to take place,\" he said.. \"We are very well aware of the agreements made in the formation of the Israeli government. I mean, diplomacy cannot stop there.\" . \"The engagement we have seen over the last days and weeks is very good. It's high time and maybe it's even a little bit late. We should have started before.\". International efforts towards a long-term solution have been stalled for nearly a decade. The Trump administration put forward a plan, now abandoned, which would have seen Palestinians given municipal control of pockets of the West Bank along with the Gaza Strip, with Israel given full security control. . The fallout from the plan's announcement sparked violence on the ground and saw the Palestinians cut off nearly all ties with the US. . Meanwhile, human rights groups increasingly call on the international community to acknowledge a \"one-state\" reality for Palestinians living under Israel's military occupation, now into its 56th year. . Mr Wennesland's interview with the BBC follows this week's visit to the region by . .. The UN envoy said there was now \"active diplomacy\" involving the Americans, the UN and Israeli and Palestinian officials.. Asked whether this would lead to fewer Israeli military raids or a restoration of PA control in parts of the West Bank, he said: \"The American side is in very specific discussions with [the Israelis]. . \"There are plans that can be rolled out. So these paradigms may change. And I said there needs to be a space for the Palestinian security forces to operate. . \"The key factor here is that the parties are not nursing their unilateral decisions… if we are going to keep the situation under control,\" he said.. He called on Israel to \"firmly deal\" with the issue of expansion of Israeli settlements and settler violence in the West Bank. He also said that Palestinian security forces needed to be able to regain control in the cities of Jenin and Nablus. . He urged a full resumption of so-called security co-ordination between Israel and the PA, which President Mahmoud Abbas last week announced he was cancelling.  . \"There are contacts, but we just had a discussion with the Palestinians on this yesterday. It is not happening in the way it has happened before. They have formally stopped it. It needs to get going again,\" he said. . The envoy said stability was also threatened by the worsening situation of the Palestinian Authority, saying some governments who helped fund it had \"checked out\". . \"There is hardly any money coming in from donors to the PA and that needs to change. . \"If you cannot pay salaries to public employees, if you cannot deliver health services, if you cannot buy medicine, if you cannot get the schools [funded], then we are in a very dire situation,\" he said, adding that UN funding was already about $1bn (£830m) alone in Gaza, which is controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. . \"We have significant programmes in the West Bank as well. But the UN cannot take over this responsibility. We cannot govern Palestine. We have no option or alternative to having a functional PA.\". ",

The frigid blast could bring \"once-in-a-generation\" wind chills that cause frostbite in less than 10 minutes, the National Weather Service has warned.. Residents from Manitoba to Maine are being urged to limit their time outdoors through Friday and Saturday.. At least 11 people have died in the bad weather in the US south since Monday. .
