        "content": "The White House also announced that the prison sentences of 75 others - most of whom were serving time on low-level drug offences - have been shortened.. The US constitution grants presidents the authority to forgive convictions or shorten sentences.. Tuesday's grants of clemency are the first of the Biden administration.. \"America is a nation of laws and second chances, redemption, and rehabilitation,\" the president said.. \"Helping those who served their time return to their families and become contributing members of their communities is one of the most effective ways to reduce recidivism [repeat offending] and decrease crime.\". The three people to be pardoned are Mr Bolden, from Chicago, Illinois; Betty Jo Bogans, 51, from Houston, Texas; and, Dexter Eugene Jackson, 52, from Athens, Georgia.. Bolden was appointed to President John F Kennedy's Secret Service detail in 1961, aged 26.. That made the former highway patrolman the first black man to guard a US president.. According to him, Mr Kennedy once introduced him as \"the Jackie Robinson of the Secret Service\" - a reference to the first African American to play professional baseball.. In 1964, Mr Bolden was fired from the Secret Service after being charged with trying to sell a government file in exchange for a $50,000 bribe.. He denied the allegations, asserting he was being framed for attempting to expose misconduct within the agency.. Among his accusations were that Secret Service agents drank heavily on the job, missed shifts, and used their official vehicles to transport women or visit bars. He also said he had faced racial abuse from co-workers.. He raised money for his legal defence through a series of piano recitals in Chicago.. Following a hung jury in his first trial, he was convicted at his second and sentenced to 15 years - even though some witnesses said they had been pressured into lying by prosecutors.. Mr Bolden served 39 months in federal prison, with a two-and-a-half year probation.. Ms Bogan and Mr Jackson served time in federal prison for drug possession and distribution charges respectively.. Mr Biden wrote that all three \"have demonstrated their commitment to rehabilitation and are striving every day to give back and contribute to their communities\".. A pardon does not mean the person is declared innocent, but does remove restrictions imposed by the conviction.. Many of .  on Tuesday \"would have received a lower sentence if they were charged with the same offence today\" due to recent criminal justice reforms, Mr Biden said.. Several were already under home confinement because of the Covid-19 pandemic.. Also on Tuesday, the White House announced a series of new measures aimed at helping former prisoners successfully re-enter society.. They include a $145m (£114m) federal programme for job training and employment support, as well as expanded access to housing, health care and capital, including by removing criminal history from federal small business grant applications.. With more than two million people behind bars, the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, although the numbers have dropped in recent years.. According to data from the World Prison Brief, the country has 639 inmates for every 100,000 people. The UK, by comparison, has 131.. Mr Biden's pardons and commutations, which coincide with the end of national Second Chance Month, came on the recommendation of a pardon attorney at his Department of Justice.. That marks a return to regular order from former president Donald Trump, who often solicited clemency requests from aides and friends.. In the final hours of his presidency in 2020, Mr Trump issued over 140 pardons and commutations, including to his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, and rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black..

The group has targeted Chinese nationals on a number of occasions, as has the Pakistani Taliban. . China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in resource-rich Balochistan province.. China's embassy in Pakistan confirmed that three of the country's citizens had been killed in Tuesday's blast. Pakistan's government condemned what it called a \"cowardly terrorist attack\".. The dead included the director of the Confucius Institute, a Chinese government-run body which offers language and cultural programmes overseas, and two other faculty members in Karachi.. CCTV footage showed a woman standing outside the gate of the institute as the van arrives, followed by a powerful explosion.. The BLA released a photo of a woman in fatigues raising two fingers in salute who it said had carried out the attack, and named her as Shariah Baloch alias Bramsh. . Local media reported that the bomber had been a student at the university.. Balochistan, rich in natural resources but Pakistan's poorest province, is home to a long-running insurgency..

        "content": "Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza also released crime scene photos and witness interviews, including Mr Baldwin's. . But police said a decision on whether to file criminal charges will depend on the outcome of future forensic work. . Halyna Hutchins, 42, was shot by Mr Baldwin while he rehearsed with what he believed to be a safe gun.. The actor, who was also a producer on the film, previously said he did not pull the trigger and had no idea how a live bullet came to be on the set near Santa Fe in the US state of New Mexico. . In videos released on Monday, police and medics can be seen racing to the scene, and bodycam footage shows first responders battling to save Hutchins. . In other clips, Mr Baldwin is seen dressed as a cowboy and practising with what appears to be the gun that killed the cinematographer. . In a statement accompanying the release of the footage, Sheriff Mendoza said the investigation into the shooting \"remains open and ongoing\". . He said several components of the investigation remain outstanding, including firearms forensics, fingerprint analysis, a report from the medical examiner and analysis of Mr Baldwin's phone data. . \"Once these investigative components are provided to the sheriff's office we will be able to complete the investigation to forward it to the Santa Fe District Attorney for review,\" Sheriff Mendoza said. . According to the New York Times, a spokesperson for the Sante Fe sheriff's office said authorities had decided to release the files after multiple requests from the media and because investigators wanted to show what information remained outstanding before the case could be passed on to prosecutors. . Authorities have refused to rule out filing criminal charges over the incident and in October .  that \"everything at this point, including criminal charges, is on the table\".. The release comes a week after producers of the film were .  and charged the maximum fine of $136,793 (£105,000). . An investigation conducted by the New Mexico Environment Department found that the makers of the film showed \"plain indifference to recognised hazards associated with use of firearms on set\". . It added that the film's management \"knew that firearm safety procedures were not being followed on set and demonstrated plain indifference to employee safety by failing to review work practices and take corrective action\"..

Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. . But during a visit to Sweden earlier this month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said \"everything had changed\" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be \"prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia\". . Her comments coincided with the .  Finland's membership of Nato could result in \"increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia\". . Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Monday that the two countries' leaders could meet in the week of 16 May to announce the bid during a state visit to Sweden by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. . Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman .  with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead.. And there have been some reports that Russia had started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that.. But Swedish outlet Aftonbladet reported that the US and UK have agreed to provide security support during the application process, citing government officials. . US defence sources told the outlet that Sweden and Finland would be treated as de-facto members of the security alliance for the duration of the application process. . The UK and US support would reportedly include an increased number of troops in the Nordic nations, further intelligence co-operation, assistance in combatting cyber threats and an increased presence of Nato warships in the Baltic sea.. Last week Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said a wide-ranging security review being carried out by Stockholm will be completed by 13 May, rather than 31 May as initially planned. . She noted that with Finland's analysis now complete \"there is now a lot of pressure\" to urgently publish the report, and her party, the Social Democrats, are expected to drop their traditional opposition to joining the bloc. . Russia sees Nato as a threat to its security, and before the war in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the bloc removed its forces from Eastern European member states. . However, Russia's invasion has had the opposite effect, with Nato bolstering its forces in Eastern Europe and traditionally neutral countries now on the verge of joining the bloc. . Public sentiment in both Sweden and Finland towards Nato membership has changed dramatically since Russia launched its invasion over two months ago. . In Finland, opinion polls show that public support for joining bloc has climbed from 28% in February to 68% last month.. Meanwhile, 57% of Swedes now favour NATO membership, up from 51% in March..

        "content": "\"Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible,\" Boris Johnson's spokesman said.. The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he must protect users.. \"Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding,\" Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet.. The European Union has said its new online rules will \"overhaul\" the digital market, including how tech giants operate.. Once they come into force, there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example.. Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech. . \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" he said . The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation.. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". . But .  Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as \"the singular solution I trust\".. He said the firm had been \"owned\" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the \"correct first step\".. Twitter \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", he said, but added he did not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\".. But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\". Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.. The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer. . Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain, according to the Reuters news agency.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. . Mr Musk said that he hopes even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". . However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". . \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers.. Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". . \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added.. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expected most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". . \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said.  . On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", regardless of whoever owns or runs Twitter.. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\"..
