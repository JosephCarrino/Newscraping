        "content": "It flew about 1,000km (620 miles) landing in waters west of Japan.. It is Pyongyang's fourth missile launch in a week and comes as the US and South Korea hold joint navy drills.. The other missiles launched - last Thursday, on Saturday and on Monday - had been short-range ballistic missiles.. North Korea's ramped-up missile activity will most likely be top of the agenda when South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol meets Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo later on Thursday - the first such visit in 12 years.. Since Monday, the US and South Korea have been carrying out drills around the Korean peninsula- the allies' largest in five years. North Korea has repeatedly said it sees such exercises as provocation.. Thursday's missile was fired at 07:10 (22:10 GMT) from Pyongyang on the east coast of North Korea, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. . Japan's defence ministry confirmed it as an ICBM type and said it flew higher than 6,000km for about 70 minutes. It landed at about 08:20 outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, the ministry said. . Japan officials have not reported any damage from the missile. . Following Thursday's launch, Mr Yoon ordered his country's military to continue with the joint US exercises as planned.. Pyongyang would pay for its \"reckless provocations\", he said. . North Korea last fired an ICBM less than a month ago - an action that sparked a UN emergency meeting and condemnation from G7 countries.. ICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range. Experts have said that such missiles launched from North Korea could potentially reach mainland United States. . Pyongyang is also believed to have developed ICBMs that can carry multiple warheads. . The escalation in North Korean aggression over the past year is one of the central topics to be discussed at the Tokyo meeting on Thursday.. Many hope the meeting - which has been hailed as a \"milestone\" in the rapprochement of South Korea and Japan - will result in closer security ties and military cooperation between the two countries.. Both countries said they would convene their national security councils following Thursday's missile launch.. In 2022, North Korea launched more than 90 missiles - .  - despite being subject to a raft of sanctions from the UN, the US, the EU and its neighbouring countries.. North Korea has become more assertive in its nuclear strategy under Kim Jong-un, who has overseen much of its recent development of its weapons programme, and four of the six nuclear tests so far..

        "content": "He was subjected to serious physical abuse during his ordeal, including having his teeth forcibly removed, police said.. Mr Vuong is being treated in hospital and further arrests are expected.. The kidnapping began in the early hours of last Thursday when a group of men broke into his home in western Sydney at 05.20 local time armed with a sledgehammer and a gun, said New South Wales Police.. He was forced into a vehicle and driven away before being \"repeatedly assaulted and tortured over a six-day period\", officers said.. The group were \"part of a criminal enterprise to extort a large sum of money\", said Detective Supt Joe Doueihi.. Acting on intelligence after extensive inquiries, on Tuesday evening armed police raided a run-down house in the suburb of Belmore and discovered Mr Vuong alive but badly injured.. \"He'd been bound, tied up, had his face covered and sustained numerous injuries and had his teeth forcibly removed\", Det Supt Doueihi said.. He was treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken to hospital, where he is now in a stable condition, he added.. A 19-year-old man was arrested at the property, and five others were detained at other locations in the city, police said.. The suspects have been named as Lolo Liavaa and Viliami Siasau, 19, Valali Tonga, Sunia Siasau and John Totau Fahamokioa, all 20, and Kiteau Tatafu, 21.. They have been charged with a range of what police described as \"serious violent offences\", including aggravated breaking and entering, grievous bodily harm, and possession of an unauthorised firearm.. All except John Totau Fahamokioa have been remanded in custody, and will appear in court in May. . Investigations are continuing, police said, with further arrests expected.. ",

In a statement, the IAEA said it would conduct further activities \"to clarify the circumstances of the removal of the nuclear material and its current location\".. It is unclear when the uranium went missing. Inspectors had reportedly wanted to visit the location last year, but the trip had to be postponed because of fighting between different Libyan militias.. The IAEA said that the site where the uranium was stored was not in government-controlled territory.. Since Libya's former dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, the country has been divided into competing political and military factions. . It is now split between an interim government in the capital Tripoli and another one in the east.. ",

        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Later on Wednesday, the Lahore High Court ordered police to postpone the arrest of Mr Khan until Thursday, pending the result of a hearing on the legitimacy of the arrest warrant.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. On Wednesday, the streets outside Mr Khan's home were littered with debris and smouldering barricades.. His supporters gathered at one of the roads - a major highway in Lahore - and chanted his name.. Hours earlier, officers in riot gear had fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to disperse hundreds of supporters at the compound. Some in the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. \"I have never witnessed such brutality, that's what shocks me,\" Waqar Khan, a PTI supporter told the BBC.. Recalling Tuesday's clashes, one woman, Tazeen, said: \"Are we not humans? What kind of a country is this? People around me could not breathe,\" one woman, Tazeen, said.. Mr Khan has said he did not appear in court because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . He earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. ",
