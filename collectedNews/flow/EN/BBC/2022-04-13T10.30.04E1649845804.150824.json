        "content": "US scientists say the world should be on the lookout for new mutations. . Lab work, described in the journal . , suggests the virus could easily shift, creating new variants.. Recent infection studies suggest those variants may prove effective at transmitting the virus, even in countries which have built up immunity from previous outbreaks of Zika, say the team from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. . Experts said the findings, although theoretical, were interesting - and a reminder that viruses other than Covid could pose a threat. . Zika is spread by bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes. The insects are found throughout the Americas - except for Canada and Chile, where it is too cold for them to survive - and across Asia. . While for most people Zika is a mild illness, with no lasting effects, it can have catastrophic consequences for babies in the womb.. If a mother contracts the virus during pregnancy, it can harm the developing baby, causing microcephaly (unusually small head) and damaged brain tissue.. The researchers recreated what happens when Zika passes back and forth between mosquitoes and humans, using cells and living mice in their experiments. . When Zika passed between mosquito cells and mice in the laboratory, small genetic changes occurred.. This meant it was relatively easy for Zika to mutate in a way that allowed the virus to thrive and spread, even in animals that had some previous immunity from a similar mosquito-borne infection called dengue.. Lead investigator Prof Sujan Shresta said: \"The Zika variant that we identified had evolved to the point where the cross-protective immunity afforded by prior dengue infection was no longer effective in mice. . \"Unfortunately for us, if this variant becomes prevalent, we may have the same issues in real life.\". Prof Jonathan Ball, an expert in viruses at the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: \"We've heard so much lately about the rapid evolution and emergence of coronavirus variants, but this is a timely reminder that shapeshifting is a common feature shared by so many viruses.. \"This work shows just how rapidly a single letter change in the genome sequence of a virus can arise, and the stark impact it can have on the disease capability of a virus. But viruses that share these changes haven't often been seen in outbreaks and, as the authors point out, these intriguing insights require more thorough investigation.\". Dr Clare Taylor, from the Society for Applied Microbiology, said: \"Although these findings were seen in laboratory experiments and therefore have limitations, it does show that there is potential for variants of concern to arise during the normal Zika transmission cycle and reminds us that monitoring is important to follow viruses as they evolve.\". She said it might be possible to predict which variants could cause significant issues in the future and intervene early.. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said past infection with Zika might still offer some protection against new variants - as has been seen with Covid. .

In contrast to the early days of the war he has more recently kept a lower profile. . He was visiting a space facility in eastern Russia with Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, one of his closest allies, to mark the 61st anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space.. The Russian leader claimed he had been left with no choice but to launch the invasion in a bid to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.. The Kremlin claims that Ukraine has committed genocide against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support this,. \"On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,\" the 69-year old insisted.. \"It's clear that we didn't have a choice. It was the right decision,\" he said, adding that Russia would  \"rhythmically and calmly\" continue the invasion.. Moscow has shifted its focus to eastern Ukraine, moving troops away from the north after encountering fierce resistance in the initial weeks of what it called its \"special operation\".. The UN says 10 million people have fled their homes since the invasion began.. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted last week that the country had suffered \"significant losses of troops\" since the conflict began.. Neither Russia nor Ukraine's estimates of Russian losses can be independently verified - and analysts have cautioned that Russia may be downplaying its casualty rate, while Ukraine could be inflating it to boost morale. Western leaders believe that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed.. The Russian economy has also been rocked by a package of severe sanctions imposed by Western nations.. However, on Tuesday, Mr Putin said Russia did not \"intend to be isolated\", arguing that it was \"impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially such a vast country as Russia\".. Mr Lukashenko also dismissed the impact of sanctions, asking Mr Putin: \"Why on earth are we getting so worried about these sanctions?\".

        "content": "But Ms Heard's team argued Mr Depp brought her to court simply to \"destroy her\".. Mr Depp, 58, has denied any abuse and has sued his ex-wife for $50m (Â£38m).. Ms Heard has in turn, sued him, with a $100m counterclaim.. Hordes of fans have already gathered outside the Virginia court for the trial, expected to last up to seven weeks.. At issue in the trial is Ms Heard's 2018 opinion piece in the Washington Post, describing herself as a \"public figure representing domestic abuse\". Mr Depp says the article - which does not mention him by name - is defamatory and derailed his career.. Beginning a day of opening arguments, Camille Vasquez, a lawyer for Mr Depp, told jurors Ms Heard had been the aggressor throughout the relationship. . Ms Heard concocted a role for herself as victim, Ms Vasquez said, once Mr Depp had asked her for a divorce in attempt to \"avoid humiliation\". . \"She is obsessed with her public image,\" she said. \"She has been living and breathing this role for years now and she is preparing to give the performance of her life.\" . Lawyers for Ms Heard instead claimed the actress had endured emotional, verbal and physical harassment at the hands of Mr Depp.. Mr Depp wants to \"haunt her, to wreck her career\", attorney Ben Rottenborn said. . Christi Dembrowski, Mr Depp's older sister, was first on the witness stand. Responding to questions from Mr Depp's lawyer, Ms Dembrowski described a volatile childhood, shaped by their mother's abuse. . \"Mom would, she would scream, she would yell. She would hit [Dad], call him names,\" Ms Dembrowski said. Mr Depp never fought back, she said. . Ms Dembrowski described her famous sibling as a gentle and loving brother, son and father to his two children. . According to Ms Dembrowski, her brother's demeanour changed when he became involved with Ms Heard. \"He seemed sadder,\" she said. . Ms Heard would often insult Mr Depp, Ms Dembrowski said, recalling an instance when Dior wanted to hire Mr Depp for an advertisement campaign. . \"She [Ms Heard] said, 'Dior, why would Dior want to do business with you? You don't have style... She called him an old fat man,\" Ms Dembrowski said. . Mr Depp's sister told jurors she was \"devastated\" by the news that Mr Depp would marry Ms Heard, and fearful that her brother's relationship was mirroring that of their parents.  . \"If I'm honest, I debated going [to the wedding],\" she said. \"I wanted to make sure that I showed up anyway, because I wanted to make sure, honestly, that my little brother knew I was going to be there no matter what.\". Ms Dembrowski is the first of an estimated 120 witnesses who will be called to testify in Virginia in the coming weeks, helping to sketch competing accounts of Mr Depp and Ms Heard's relationship. . On Sunday, ahead of the trial, Ms Heard released a statement to Instagram, writing that she has \"always maintained a love for Johnny\". . \"It brings me great pain to have to live out the details of our past life together in front of the world,\" she said. . \"Words matter!\". The words were delivered with a flourish, the beginning of a case about how Johnny Depp had been wounded, emotionally and materially by the words of Amber Heard.  Benjamin Chew, leading Johnny Depp's legal team, laid out what we are about to witness, a case that will try to portray Amber Heard as a liar, a \"troubled\" and \"manipulative\" woman who was, they say, the real abuser.. The opening statement was delivered with all the slickness of a Hollywood movie, you almost felt there was going to be a round of applause at the end but, inside the court, all was calm. . Johnny Depp sat silently, carefully watching the lawyers' presentations to the jury of 11. Amber Heard, impassive, attentive, occasionally appearing to take notes.. Watching was a crowd made up largely of Depp fans. Before court proceedings began they were warned to keep phones hidden, not to take pictures, there would be no shouting of 'we love you, Johnny.' But as it began there was not a murmur or a sign of movement. Confidence was high that this would vindicate their idol. . This is going to be, they feel, the full story with evidence from forensic experts, a counsellor, the police and friends. Johnny Depp may have lost his case in London - this they feel will be different.. Amber Heard's legal team then presented the challenge.  Yes, she had accused him of abuse but that was not what her article in the Washington Post was about.  She did not name Johnny Depp, she did not write the headline and in America there is a special constitutional protection for words written in the newspapers.  . Most lawyers would agree that bringing a successful libel action in America is much harder than in the UK and in the case in Britain, the judge came down firmly on the side of Amber Heard's version of events.. Today, however, was just an overture. Jurors were warned that what was to come would be graphic, neither side said they wanted to reveal the details of their turbulent private life and celebrity friends but that is now where we are..

In the interview with France Inter Radio, she said: \"I do not want French people to suffer the consequences of sanctions\" on oil and gas.. France, like many other European countries, imports much of its natural gas through pipelines from Russia, using it for residential and commercial energy. . But Ms Le Pen has been criticised by rivals over her past support for Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. . She previously appeared to support Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, and . .. In 2014, when Crimea was annexed by Russia, . . . Ms Le Pen justified her previous remarks by saying the annexation of Crimea was a different situation to the current invasion of Ukraine, and painted her support for Mr Putin as reflective of her wider ambition for a \"multi-polar\" world, Reuters reports.. Despite softening her stance on leaving the European Union and other nationalist issues in recent years, she is still widely opposed by most of France's political establishment.. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy, for example, publicly announced on Tuesday that he would vote for his party's rival Emmanuel Macron, and encouraged others to do the same.. Mr Macron \"has the necessary experience faced with a grave international crisis\", the former president wrote, \"and his commitment to Europe is clear and unambiguous\". . But in a sign of the changing political landscape, Mr Sarkozy's Republicans party candidate - once a dominant force in French politics - attracted less than 5% of the vote in Sunday's first round. Another former titan, the Socialists, received less than 2%.. Far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, who came third in the first round with 22% of the vote, warned his supporters not to give a single vote to Ms Le Pen. However,  he pointedly did not back Mr Macron instead. . Polling suggests the final battle between Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen could be extremely tight - with projections pointing to as close as a 51%-49% victory for Mr Macron.. Mr Macron is coming under pressure over his proposed pension reforms, which include raising the retirement age to 65.. On Monday, after Ms Le Pen's strong electoral performance, the incumbent president suggested there was room to change his proposed timelines - something Ms Le Pen painted as an empty promise to try to win over left-leaning voters.. The presidential campaign still has nearly two weeks to go, with the run-off elections scheduled for 24 April. . This video can not be played. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters.

        "content": "Ukrainian troops have said they are running out of ammunition, and are believed to have been pushed back into two isolated pockets adjoining the coastline. . The city's fate is likely to be critical for the next phase of the war. In Russian hands it would provide control of a clear swathe of territory connecting Moscow's two fronts in the south and east. It would release large numbers of forces to redeploy, and provide President Vladimir Putin with a moment of strategic \"victory\" after a lethally shambolic first stage to his invasion.. It would mark a huge loss, if by now an expected one, for Ukraine's leadership which has described Mariupol as \"the heart of this war today\".. Russian troops started their encirclement of Mariupol in early March. The siege has killed thousands of civilians and unleashed an appalling struggle for survival for trapped residents who remain.. Thousands of people have escaped further north, risking a deadly journey through the front line. Here, in Zaporizhzhia, . In recent days Russian forces are thought to have pushed in further by dividing the remaining holdout of Mariupol's defenders, according to think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). . It's believed Ukraine's forces have been forced back to the port area and the Azovstal plant, a massive iron and steel works from where they had launched counter-attacks for weeks. . Videos have emerged of fighters apparently from the 36th marine brigade vowing not to surrender their positions. . \"We are holding on to every bit of the city wherever possible,\" says one in a video posted to social media channels on Tuesday.. \"But the reality is the city is encircled and blocked and there was no re-supply of ammunition or food,\" he adds. Part of the footage shows him alongside several other marines in a room that looks like a basement shelter. One of the men has crutches leaning against his chair.. A post on Monday on the brigade's Facebook page described the situation as \"the last battleâ¦ It is death for some of us, and captivity for the rest,\" it said, adding they had been \"pushed back\" and \"surrounded\" by Russian troops. . Ukrainian analysts differed over whether the post could be relied on as genuine, with some claiming the page had been hacked. But more than 36 hours later the post remained on the site. . The siege and a resulting collapse in communications in Mariupol mean it is difficult to independently verify reports about changes on the ground. . There is little doubt Ukrainian forces have been desperate for new supplies of weapons, ammunition, food and water.. Ukraine's military reportedly managed over the weeks to resupply troops with kit including night and thermal vision goggles, portable battery charging packs and even anti-tank munitions; but it became increasingly hard. . \"Ultimately, the city was surrounded so soon into the invasion that there was never a chance to build up supplies,\" says Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).. \"They've already held out far, far longer than any external analysis would have predicted possible. So it's difficult to say how much longer they can go on,\" he says, adding that they have \"achieved extraordinary results with very little\".. Ukrainian attempts to rotate forces or evacuate the wounded also became much more high risk as Russia tightened its siege. . The Russian defence ministry claimed two weeks ago it had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter 5km (three miles) from the Sea of Azov shore. It was thought to have been coming out of the city. . On Tuesday, it claimed up to 100 Ukrainian troops had tried to fight their way out of the steel works plant - but said half were killed by Russian artillery and airstrikes, and more than 40 surrendered. . In his video address to the nation late on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms. The future of us all, each of our cities, each of our villages.. \"And I am grateful to everyone who understands this. Who does not stop resisting even when it seems that the result is very far. Because the darkest time is always before dawn.. \"I want to separately address those heroes who are having a very hard time. Those who defend Mariupol.

Volunteers of the \"Right Sector\". The 555th military hospital and National Police employees.\". As well as the marines, the defence of Mariupol also consists of the Azov battalion, an ultranationalist militia formed in 2014 which Kyiv says has been reformed and is now part of Ukraine's National Guard.. They are only a tiny part of Ukraine's overall forces, but their presence has been a key focus of Moscow's propaganda war: it refers to the invasion as a \"special military operation\" claiming it is to \"demilitarise\" and \"denazify\" Ukraine.. Meanwhile, .  They are a reminder of how the conflict could quickly trigger a further dangerous escalation.. The full capture of the city could see significant numbers of Russian troops, so far used to contain and prevent resupply in Mariupol, reconstituted and moved elsewhere, particularly in other parts of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow is gearing up for a major offensive. . It could also see Moscow consolidate its progress north of Mariupol, which is one of the reasons the Ukrainians were finding it so hard to relieve the city, according to Mr Bronk.. The forces could also be used to bolster Russian-occupied Kherson, where Ukrainian troops have been attempting to retake ground with some success. . President Zelensky continued his metaphor that Mariupol is the heart of the war. \"If it stops beating then we will beâ¦ weaker,\" he said.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters.

Here's an extract: \"It's easy to guess how the recently widowed resident of Stavropol must have felt talking to journalists from a country that is an accessory to the death of her husband.\". This attempt to link Britain to the deaths of Russian soldiers in Ukraine shows how Western journalists in Russia are viewed, increasingly, as the enemy.. And how the authorities here are searching for scapegoats for the horrors unfolding in Ukraine.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters.

        "content": "Police said they were looking for Frank R James, 62, in connection with the attack as he had rented a U-Haul van that may be linked to the shooting. . The key to the van, rented in Philadelphia, was found at the scene.. \"We are looking to determine if he has any connection to the train,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said. . The New York Police Department (NYPD) asked \"anyone with information on his whereabouts\" to call a hotline.. Mr James has not been named as a suspect in the attack. Being identified as a person of interest means police believe he may have information concerning the crime.. The New York Times reports that Mr James, who has addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia, appears to have posted dozens of videos on social media in recent years, in which he expresses bigoted views. More recently he had also criticised New York City Mayor Eric Adams.. In a briefing late on Tuesday, police gave more details of the incident which saw a male attacker detonate two smoke grenades and open fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station.. The attack unfolded shortly before 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT) on Tuesday, and police said the man had a Glock 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.. \"He then fired that weapon at least 33 times, striking 10 people,\" police chief Mr Essig said. Seven men and three women were shot.. Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station.. Another 13 people \"suffered injuries related to smoke inhalation, falling down or a panic attack\", the police chief said.. All of the victims are expected to survive.. \"The male then fled the scene, and detectives are actively trying to determine his whereabouts,\" Ms Essig said.. Investigators found the Glock handgun, three extended magazines, a hatchet and a range of potential incendiary devices at the scene. . A $50,000 (Â£38,450) reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the suspect.. Police say the gunman was roughly 5ft 5in tall and 170lb (77kg). He was said to be wearing a construction vest, grey hooded sweatshirt, and a gas mask.. The attacker's motive was not immediately known. . New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said earlier on Tuesday that the shooting was not initially being treated as an act of terrorism. . Witnesses have described hearing people shouting for medical assistance and fleeing in panic. Brooklyn resident Yayha Ibrahim said he saw people running from the 36th Street station.. \"I saw a lady, she was shot right in her leg and she was screaming for help,\" he told Reuters news agency. Rescue workers \"did a good job of coming quick and fast, and the ambulance came in and they took her\", he added.. \"My subway door opened into calamity. It was smoke and blood and people screaming,\" eyewitness Sam Carcamo told the Associated Press. He added that a billow of smoke poured out of the train once its doors opened.. Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system.. \"At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,\" Mayor Adams later said.. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to \"all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers.\". US cities have seen a rise in gun violence over the past two years.. \"This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said after the attack. \"We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives.\". The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate.
