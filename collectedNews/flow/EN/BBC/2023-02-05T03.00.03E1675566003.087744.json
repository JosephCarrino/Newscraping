        "content": "Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The Department of Defense confirmed its fighter jets brought down the balloon over US territorial waters.. China's foreign ministry later expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US's use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft\".. Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion.. An F-22 jet fighter engaged the high-altitude balloon with one missile - an AIM-9X Sidewinder - and it went down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT), a defence official told reporters.. Defence officials told US media the debris landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. The military is now trying to recover debris which is spread over seven miles (11km). Two naval ships, including one with a heavy crane for recovery, are in the area.. US President Joe Biden had been under pressure to shoot the balloon down since defence officials first announced they were tracking it on Thursday.. After the balloon was shot down, Mr Biden said: \"They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it.\". In a statement a few hours later, the Chinese foreign ministry said: \"The Chinese side has repeatedly informed the US side after verification that the airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident.\" . The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend's trip to China over the \"irresponsible act\". . The Chinese authorities have denied it is a spying aircraft, and instead said it was a weather ship blown astray. . Reacting to the incident, Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The Chinese Communist Party government's actions that violate international law and violate the airspace and sovereignty of other countries should not be tolerated in a civilised international community.\". China considers self-ruled Taiwan a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve this.. But Taiwan sees itself as independent, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.. President Biden first approved the plan to down the balloon on Wednesday, but the Pentagon said it had decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at undue risk.. Groundwork for the operation was laid when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast on Saturday afternoon because of a \"national security effort\". . The coast guard also advised mariners to leave the area due to military operations \"that present a significant hazard\". . An eyewitness on the coast, Hayley Walsh, told BBC News she saw three fighter jets circling before the missile was fired, then \"we heard a huge boom, the house shook\".. This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. One senior military official told CNN the recovery of debris should be \"fairly easy\" and could take \"relatively short time\". The official added that \"capable Navy divers\" could be deployed to assist in the operation.. Defence officials also revealed on Saturday the balloon had first entered US airspace on 28 January, before moving to Canadian airspace three days later, and re-entering the US on 31 January. The object was spotted in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.. Relations between China and the US have been exacerbated by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of US sovereignty.. Mr Blinken - America's top diplomat - told Beijing it was \"an irresponsible act\" ahead of his now-cancelled trip on 5-6 February - it would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.. But China sought to play down the cancellation of his visit, saying in a statement on Saturday that neither side had formally announced a plan for a trip. . China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype\" and accused \"some politicians and media in the United States\" of using the incident \"as a pretext to attack and smear China.\". On Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. China has so far made no public comments on the reported second balloon.. ",

Insp Paul Robinson, from Western Australia Police, said it was possible the girl had jumped in the water to swim with dolphins seen nearby.. He described the incident as \"very, very traumatic\" and the family of the girl was \"absolutely devastated by the news\".. People have been urged to take \"additional caution\" and to abide by any beach closures.. Fisheries experts say it is unusual to find sharks in that part of the river, Mr Robinson said. . This is believed to be the first fatal shark attack in the Swan River since a 13-year-old boy was killed in January 1923.. Australia typically records about 20 shark attacks each year, with most in New South Wales and Western Australia. . There were two fatal shark attacks in 2021, and seven in 2020..

        "content": "It closed temporarily after at least 59 people complained of food poisoning, having eaten tortilla there last week. Six have been hospitalised, according to the Madrid region's health department. . Casa Dani says it is co-operating with the local health authorities to ensure its kitchens are salmonella-free and can open again soon. . It has won a number of prizes, including the 2019 Spanish potato tortilla championship, and featured in the Netflix foodie series Somebody Feed Phil. It serves around 100,000 tortillas each year. . The case has put under scrutiny how restaurants prepare this dish and the regulations governing the cooking of eggs.. For the last three decades, government guidelines have meant that eggs served to the public either have to be pasteurised or, if fresh, cooked through at a temperature of at least 75C. . In December 2022, a government decree slightly loosened those rules, stating that fresh eggs should be cooked through at \"70C or more for two seconds\" or \"at a temperature of 63C for 20 seconds\". . These temperatures are important: egg white sets at around 62-65C and egg yolk at 65-70C. . \"We put a thermometer into the tortilla, and we leave it cooking at 70 degrees for about two minutes and that kills all the bacteria,\" says Alfredo García, owner of Sylkar restaurant in Madrid, which specialises in the dish. \"At 70 degrees it's still runny.\". María del Toro, of the La Rioja Centre for Biomedical Research (CIBIR), told La COPE radio station that \"we all like [a runny tortilla] but it has more risk, especially for children, pregnant women and elderly people\". . The regional government of Madrid has also offered its own advice on the matter, warning that the summer is particularly propitious for salmonella in tortillas. . \"This happens when fresh eggs are used, the centre of the tortilla does not set and the cooked tortilla is left at room temperature for more than two hours before being consumed,\" the local government says on its website. . These guidelines advise against cleaning eggs before putting them in the fridge and against breaking eggs on the plate used for preparing them, to avoid contamination. . They also advise using pasteurised eggs, as opposed to fresh eggs, if making a runny tortilla. . However, 90% of customers in Sylkar restaurant prefer a runny tortilla with fresh eggs, Mr García says - although he admits that the Casa Dani case has pushed many diners to request that it be more cooked than normal in recent days. . But he points out that preferences regarding the solidity or liquidity of tortilla are also influenced by geography. . \"South of Madrid, people prefer them much more set,\" he says. \"In Andalusia, tortillas are like bricks. In northern Spain, tortillas tend to be much less set, much more liquid.\" . The tortilla has long been a battleground for differing tastes over another issue: whether or not to cook it with onion. . \"If you're one of those who uses onion, switch off now,\" warned Dani García, owner of Casa Dani, in a recent cooking video. . But the veteran TV chef Karlos Arguiñano takes a different view. . \"Tortilla without onion is champion of Europe,\" he said recently. \"But tortilla with onion is champion of the world.\"  . ",

        "content": "The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said his \"heart breaks with sorrow\" over continued violence there.. South Sudan has been wracked by civil war since becoming independent in 2011.. Despite a peace deal in 2018, violence driven by ethnic tensions has continued - more than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict.. At least 20 people were killed in a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit.. On the first full day of his visit, Pope Francis met hundreds of South Sudan's religious leaders at the Cathedral of Saint Therese in the capital Juba. . During his address, he urged them not to remain neutral, and instead speak up against \"the injustice and the abuses of power that oppress\".. \"If we want to be pastors who intercede, we cannot remain neutral before the pain caused by acts of injustice and violence. To violate the fundamental rights of any woman or man is an offence against Christ.\". Elsewhere in Juba on Saturday, Archbishop Justin Welby said: \"My heart breaks, I can hardly speak, with sorrow for South Sudan.\". \"I beg that at every level, from the president to the smallest child, that people find the mercy of God and are transformed, and that there is peace and good government. That no-one steals money. That no-one kills their neighbour for cattle,\" .  at the All Saints Anglican Cathedral.. It is Pope Francis' first papal visit to the country. . In 2019, a year after a peace deal failed to stem political and ethnic unrest, Pope Francis shocked many by kissing the feet of South Sudan's bitter political rivals, President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, when they met at the Vatican - asking them to respect the terms of the ceasefire.. But the violence has continued - and Pope Francis, Justin Welby and Church of Scotland Moderator Iain Greenshields have been hearing from some of the two million people displaced by the conflict as part of their peace mission. They heard testimonies from displaced children at a meeting in Juba on Saturday, many of whom had been on the run from violence for most of their lives.. According to Reuters, the Pope was told by a nun at the Cathedral of Saint Therese how two of her fellow sisters were killed in an ambush in Juba in 2021.. The three Christian leaders also led thousands of people in a joint prayer on Saturday evening at the mausoleum of John Garang, South Sudan's founding father. . On Sunday, the Pope will celebrate Mass outdoors, which is expected to draw large crowds.. ",

Mr Bagshaw's family said the pair were attempting to help an elderly woman when their cars were hit by a shell.. Soledar had been the focus of intense fighting and last month Russia's military claimed to have captured the Ukrainian salt-mine town after a long battle. The government in Kyiv disputed the claim.. Despite the continued fighting in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's chief of staff, said 116 Ukrainian soldiers had been released on Saturday.. He said released prisoners included defenders of Mariupol, partisans from Kherson and snipers from Bakhmut, as well as two personnel from special operations.. Russia's defence ministry said 63 servicemen had been returned as part of a \"complex mediation process\".. It said it included people of a \"sensitive category\" thanks to the mediation of the United Arab Emirates, though it did not specify what those people did. .

However, recent polling suggests most Japanese support gay marriage.. A number of same-sex couples have also filed lawsuits across Japan in recent years arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage violates the country's constitution.. Prior to Mr Arai's dismissal, Mr Kishida had talked about issues surrounding same-sex marriage in parliament.. He stated that it needed to be carefully considered because of its potential impact on traditional family structures.. Mr Arai reacted to the remarks afterwards, telling reporters that he \"wouldn't like it if [LGBT couples] lived next door\" and \"doesn't even want to look at them.\".
