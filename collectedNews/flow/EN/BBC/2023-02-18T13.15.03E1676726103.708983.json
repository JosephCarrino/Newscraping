The victims were killed at several locations, including a store and two homes, in Arkabutla, a community of fewer than 300 people.. Police have charged a 52-year-old local man with first-degree murder and held him at the county jail.. No motive for his attack has yet been identified.. The suspect is believed to have acted alone, said Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves.. The rampage began when the gunman entered a petrol station convenience store at around 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) and shot a man to whom he had no apparent connection, Sheriff Brad Lance said.. He then went to a nearby home where he fatally shot his ex-wife and, . , struck but did not shoot her fiance.. Investigators say the gunman then drove to a home next to his own residence and fatally shot a man who may have been his stepfather, as well as an unnamed woman, . .. He then shot two people, one inside a car and one on the road, not far from his own home. The final two victims appear to have been construction workers on a job at the site, according to Sheriff Lance.. Deputies spotted the suspect inside a vehicle matching witness descriptions and were able to apprehend him near his home after a brief car chase.. \"We don't have a lot of violent crime here. This is shocking,\" said Sheriff Lance. \"I never dreamt that we would deal with something like that here.\". He said the suspect had a shotgun and two handguns in his possession.. A primary and secondary school in nearby Coldwater were placed on lockdown during the incident, which unfolded 45 miles (72km) south of Memphis, in neighbouring Tennessee. . Ethan Cash, a 19-year-old local resident, told WREG-TV that he had seen the gun-toting suspect.. Mr Cash said he also checked the pulse of the victim who died inside his vehicle and drew his own pistol on an injured man nearby who turned out to be the victim's brother.. Friday's incident marks the 73rd mass shooting since the year began, according to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) non-profit research database. . GVA defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed.. ",

Mr Grozev said he only found out that he and his son and been disinvited when he received a message by someone from CNN a few days ago. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they had tickets to the event, but the invite was withdrawn based on advice from UK police.. The ban was down to \"concerns about public safety and security,\" he was told, but was given no more information on what those risks were.. Mr Grozev added, however, that in recent weeks he has received \"numerous alerts from different law enforcement agencies around Europe that there is credible evidence that my life is in danger\".. The Metropolitan Police said .  that threats by foreign states to journalists in the UK are \"a reality that we are absolutely concerned with\"..

        "content": "Wagner has recruited heavily in Russian prisons, and Mr Kirby said most casualties were untrained convicts.. Despite the casualties, Wagner has made gains around the city of Bakhmut.. Some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place around the eastern city, with Wagner mercenaries heavily involved in Russian efforts to capture it.. Ukrainian troops say Wagner fighters had been sent into attacks in large numbers over open ground, and a Ukrainian army spokesperson said Moscow had failed to evacuate wounded and dead soldiers - leading to \"places where their bodies are just piled up\".. Capturing Bakhmut could allow Russia to make advances to bigger cities further west, like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.. However, Mr Kirby - the US National Security Council spokesman - suggested further advances could prove difficult given the gains made in Bakhmut had taken months to achieve and come at a \"devastating cost that is not sustainable\".. He also questioned the military significance of the city. . \"It is possible that they may end up being successful in Bakhmut, but it will prove of no real worth to them because it is of no real strategic value,\" Mr Kirby told reporters.. Elsewhere, UK intelligence officials have estimated that Russian regular forces and Wagner troops may have suffered between 175,000-200,000 casualties - including 40,000-60,000 deaths.. The high number of deaths was \"almost certainly\" due to \"extremely rudimentary medical provision\", the UK's defence ministry said.. The Wagner Group was much smaller before the war, with just 5,000 fighters, most of whom were experienced former soldiers.. It started recruiting tens of thousands of fighters last year - largely from prisons, according to the US - as Russia had trouble finding troops for its invasion of Ukraine. Half of those convicts have probably been wounded or killed, UK officials say.. But last week, Mr Prigozhin, the group's founder, announced it would stop recruiting in prisons. The move followed longstanding tensions between Wagner and the Russian military.. \"The number of Wagner units will decrease, and we will also not be able to carry out the scope of tasks that we would like to,\" he said.. Mr Prigozhin has blamed Moscow's \"monstrous bureaucracy\" for slowing down progress in Ukraine, and accused the Russian army of unfairly taking credit for previous Wagner successes.. Wagner is believed to have started operations in 2014 in the annexed Crimean Peninsula and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.. ",
