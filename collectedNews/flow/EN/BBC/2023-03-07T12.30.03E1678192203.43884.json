        "content": "In the video, the Ukrainian soldier is seen smoking a cigarette in a trench. He says \"glory to Ukraine\" before being shot with automatic weapons.. The soldier has not been officially named, but the BBC has spoken to a family who say they recognised him.. A woman, who said she was the soldier's sister, said: \"My brother would certainly be capable of standing up to the Russians like that. . \"He never hid the truth in his life and certainly wouldn't do so in front of the enemy.\". The soldier served in the 30th Brigade of Ukraine's armed forces, the BBC has confirmed.. In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the prisoner of war (POW) is shot dead. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made. It first emerged on social media on Monday. Russia has not commented.. Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes since President Vladimir Putin launched a full scale-invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russia denies the allegations.. In his video address, President Zelensky said \"the occupiers\" killed \"a warrior who bravely said to their faces: 'Glory to Ukraine!'\". \"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\". Mr Zelensky was referring to a battle cry in Ukraine's military that has become popular among millions of Ukrainians.. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the footage was \"another proof this was is genocidal\", calling for an \"immediate investigation\" by the International Criminal Court.. Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets accused Russian troops of committing war crimes by violating the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of POWs.. And Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said a criminal investigation had already been opened.. Ukraine has previously accused Russian troops of torturing, raping and killing Ukrainian prisoners of war.. Last July, a video emerged that showed a captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. The Russian soldier filmed carrying out the attack in the town of Severodonetsk was identified as a member of a unit belonging to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.. In November, Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of executing a group of Russian prisoners.. It followed a video from the front line in eastern Ukraine showing the apparent surrender of a number of soldiers, in an incident that ended in their deaths.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "Unicef estimates that more than one billion women and adolescent girls worldwide are malnourished.. It says recent crises including war and Covid have made it increasingly hard for them to get the food they need.. Unicef has urged the international community to make food security a priority, including supporting failing nutrition programmes. . It stressed the impact the malnutrition is having on children's health..  found that the one billion undernourished women and adolescent girls were \"underweight and of short stature\" as a result, according to data analysis of women in most countries in the world.. It also found that they suffered from a deficiency in essential micronutrients as well as from anaemia.. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa \"remain the epicentre of the nutrition crisis among adolescent girls and women\", the report said.. It found that 68% of women and adolescent girls there were underweight, and 60% of those suffered from anaemia.. \"Inadequate nutrition during girls' and women's lives can lead to weakened immunity, poor cognitive development, and an increased risk of life-threatening complications - including during pregnancy and childbirth,\" Unicef said.. Malnutrition could also have \"dangerous and irreversible consequences for their children's survival, growth, learning, and future earning capacity\", it added.. \"Globally, 51 million children under two years are stunted. We estimate that about half of these children become stunted during pregnancy and the first six months of life, when a child is fully dependent on the mother for nutrition,\" it said.. Unicef estimates that between 2020 and 2022, the number of pregnant or breastfeeding women suffering from acute malnutrition increased from 5.5 to 6.9 million in the 12 countries deemed to be in food crisis.. These are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Chad and Yemen.. \"Without urgent action from the international community, the consequences could last for generations to come,\" said Unicef chief executive Catherine Russell.. \"To prevent undernutrition in children, we must also address malnutrition in adolescent girls and women,\" she added.. Unicef called for mandatory legal measures to \"expand large-scale food fortification of routinely consumed foods such as flour, cooking oil and salt\" to help reduce micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in girls and women..

        "content": "Mr Qin, China's former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday.. The .  has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties. . \"It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,\" Mr Qin said. . The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew.. The US called for establishing \"guardrails\", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added. . He was referring to US President Joe Biden's comments last month that the US would \"compete fully with China but [is] not looking conflict\". . Mr Qin said: \"If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?\" . He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with \"the presumption of guilt\". . Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a \"clear violation of US sovereignty\". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was . . . Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump's administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China's militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid.. Mr Qin's comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping's unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday.. Mr Xi said \"Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China and that this brought \"severe challenges\" to the country.. On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an \"invisible hand\" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume.. However, he asked: \"Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?\". The Ukraine crisis has reached a \"critical juncture\", he said.. \"Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control.\". Mr Qin, 56, was named China's foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country's history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year.. A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Japan forces H3 rocket to self-destruct after engine failure. Its space agency had to send a self-destruct command to the H3 rocket when its second-stage engine failed minutes after lift-off.. Observers say it is a significant setback for Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).. The government called the test failure \"extremely regrettable\".. The H3 rocket is the first medium-lift rocket designed by Japan in three decades. . It has been presented as a cheaper alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 for launching commercial and government satellites into Earth's orbit.. On Tuesday, engineers had aimed to send the 57m (187ft) rocket into space with a monitoring satellite on board. The ALOS-3 system is capable of detecting North Korean missile launches.. But Jaxa said soon after launch, engineers were forced to send a self-destruct prompt to the H3 after it experienced \"reduced velocity\" in the second stage of its launch. . Tuesday's launch came after an aborted launch in February, when the rocket failed to get off the launch pad due to faulty rocket boosters. . \"Unlike the previous cancellation and postponement, this time it was a complete failure,\" Hirotaka Watanabe, a space policy professor at Osaka University told Reuters.. \"This will have a serious impact on Japan's future space policy, space business and technological competitiveness,\" he added.. Japan's science minister Keiko Nagaoka said authorities would investigate the cause of the engine failure. . She apologised for \"failing to meet the expectations of the public and related parties\" and described the development as \"extremely regrettable\". . Japan had presented the H3 as a viable commercial alternative to the Falcon 9 rocket because the H3 ran on a lower-cost engine with 3D-printed parts. . Had the mission succeeded, JAXA said it had planned to launch the H3 around six times a year for the next two decades.. Japan is deepening cooperation with the US in space and has committed to carrying cargo to the planned .  - which NASA plans to deploy to the moon's orbit.. Tokyo's broader space programme also involves sending people to the moon again, including Japanese astronauts.. ",
