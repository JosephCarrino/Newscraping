        "content": "\"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said.. China's plan calls for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty.. However, the 12-point document does not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and it also condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", in what is seen as a veiled criticism of Ukraine's allies in the West. . The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit with Mr Xi.. Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. \"We share Beijing's views,\" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said .  - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.. Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?. \"I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,\" he added.. China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC's World Affairs Editor John Simpson. . The Chinese proposals follow Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.. After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China's state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to \"deepen political trust\" and \"strengthen strategic coordination\" with Moscow.. Western officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing \"doesn't have much credibility\" because it had \"not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine\".. President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine's north, east and south.. But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.. The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. At a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory \"will inevitably await us\" if allies \"respect their promises and deadlines\".. Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. . The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.. The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after .  during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia's invasion. . \"We didn't work well for many years, we didn't pay attention, I think it's a big mistake,\" he said.. Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.. \"What I saw. It was horrible,\" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.. The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.. The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.. The White House's fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. . A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.. Moldova is Europe's poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. It comes days after US President .  and held talks with Mr Zelensky.. On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions technology that has a civilian and military dual use.. ",

        "content": "In a lawsuit filed on Thursday, the states claimed the limits on the drug are not supported by evidence.. Medication abortion is the most common method of the procedure in the US.. Now accounting for more than half of all abortions in the country, it has become the focus of growing political attacks since the US Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion last summer.. In November, a coalition of conservative anti-abortion activists filed its own lawsuit, challenging the drug's approval.. The combination of mifepristone and another drug, misoprostol, is considered safe and highly effective in terminating pregnancies within the first 10 weeks.. But while misoprostol is freely available, the FDA tightly controls who can prescribe and dispense mifepristone.. That has created \"burdensome restrictions\" on a drug that is the \"gold standard\" for abortions and has a high safety profile, the Democratic suit argues.. Filed in federal court, it represents the states of Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Vermont.. \"The availability of medication abortion has never been more important,\" wrote the plaintiffs, noting that approval of the drug was \"based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the scientific evidence\".. But restrictions on the drug have made it \"harder for doctors to prescribe, harder for pharmacies to fill, harder for patients to access, and more burdensome... to dispense\", they said.. Late last year, abortion opponents argued in their own suit that the drug's stringent regulation is evidence that it is dangerous to women and young girls.. The Alliance Defending Freedom legal advocacy group alleged that the FDA had overstepped its authority, approving the drug \"without basis\" and spending the next two decades \"removing what few protections were initially in place\".. Its suit calls on the court to order the FDA to withdraw mifepristone from the market entirely.. ",

        "content": "Mr Igwe, an opposition PDP member of the House of Representatives, was also caught with a list of people to give the money to, police say.. In previous elections, politicians have been accused of rigging polls through vote buying.. Nigeria has recently issued new banknotes, partly in order to make it harder for politicians to amass large sums of money in order to bribe voters.. However, not enough of the new notes are in circulation, leading to widespread anger and frustration. People have been queuing for hours outside banks in order to get cash, often without success, while some have attacked banks.. Some 40% of Nigerians do not have bank accounts and so rely on cash to buy food, and for other everyday uses.. , police in Rivers State, where Mr Igwe was arrested, urged \"all contestants and political parties to comply strictly with provisions of the Electoral Act and other relevant laws\".. Mr Igwe, who represents part of the southern city of Port Harcout, has not yet commented on the matter.. The elections are predicted to be the most competitive since the end of military rule in 1999, with three candidates - Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Bola Tinubu of the governing APC - all seen as potential winners.. The head of the country's electoral commission, Inec, has told the BBC's Peter Okwoche that the authorities are prepared for Saturday's vote.. \"Reports around the country indicate that materials are being delivered to the local governments as planned,\" Mahmood Yakubu said.. \"We're exactly where we wanted to be in terms of preparation,\" Mr Yakubu added, saying security agencies had \"assured\" Inec that the vote would go ahead smoothly.. This video can not be played. \"We are ready,\" says Inec chairman Mahmood Yakubu. There had been concerns that it might not be possible to hold the election in parts of the country, which is facing an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, a nationwide kidnapping-for-ransom crisis and a separatist insurgency in the south-east.. A senatorial candidate for the opposition Labour Party, Oyibo Chukwu, was shot dead on Wednesday in the south-eastern Enugu State while he was returning from the campaign trail. The parliamentary election in Enugu East has been postponed following his killing.. Police have blamed the separatist group Ipob for the killings. The group has not yet commented. . The authorities have ordered the closure of all land borders for Saturday's vote starting from midnight for 24 hours, to stop foreign nationals from trying to vote.. On Thursday Inec revealed that a total of 87.2 million voter cards had been collected. More than 93 million people had registered to vote, which means that some six million people had not managed to collect their cards and so would not be able to cast their ballots.. There have been reports of people saying they were unable to collect their cards. There was one case of voter cards . , only to be discovered by a hunter.. ",

        "content": "He is one of at least four journalists being investigated for reporting or commenting on the earthquake.. Press freedom groups say dozens more have been detained, harassed or prevented from reporting.. At least 50,000 people were killed when earthquakes hit both Turkey and Syria. . Turkey's authorities have not commented on the detentions.. On the night of the earthquake, Mr Koçer - who is Kurdish and contributes to pro-opposition news sites such as Bianet and Duvar - was smoking on his balcony in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, when his two dogs suddenly started barking. . He later remembered how they had barked just like that in 2020, seconds before a smaller earthquake hit eastern Turkey.. \"I felt I was shaking. I felt the house shaking, I felt the TV shaking,\" says Mr Koçer. He hid under a dinner table with the dogs and then rushed outside.. Mr Koçer left Diyarbakir and drove to the city of Gaziantep. He was shocked by scenes of destruction and victims enduing freezing temperatures in towns near the very epicentre of the quake.. At least 3,000 of the earthquake's victims died in Gaziantep. . \"When holding the microphone, behind the camera or in front of the camera, I could not hold back my tears,\" Mr Koçer recalls.. Mr Koçer was touched by the influx of volunteers and rescue teams coming from Western Turkey, and he shared their stories on Twitter. Some of the survivors told him they received no aid for days. Similar complaints were cited across pro-opposition media outlets. . Visiting the earthquake-affected areas, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the people he would rebuild their cities. But he also warned that those spreading \"fake news\" and \"causing social chaos\" would be prosecuted, calling them \"provocateurs\".. Mr Koçer says that while he was reporting from the region hit by the earthquake, Diyarbakir police left a note at his apartment, instructing him to visit the police station and give a statement.. At the station, he was told that he was being investigated under a recently introduced disinformation law. He said the police questioned him about his reporting from the earthquake epicentre and accused him of spreading false information. . Turkey's new law was adopted in October. It criminalised the public spreading of disinformation and gave the state much broader powers to control news sites and social media. . The Venice Commission, a legal watchdog of the Council of Europe, said the law would interfere with freedom of expression. . Opposition parties call it a \"censorship law\".. Mr Koçer insists that he was meticulous in his work and interviewed all sides, from survivors to the police, the gendarmerie and rescue workers. \"I did not share information without thorough research and analysis,\" he says.. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called the investigation against Mr Koçer \"absurd\" and urged the authorities to drop it. . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an advocacy group, at least three more journalists are facing criminal charges.. Merdan Yanardağ and Enver Aysever are prominent Istanbul-based political commentators with large social media followings. Both have criticised the government's rescue efforts. They're both under investigation along with Mehmet Güleş, who, like Mr Koçer, is based in Diyarbakir. He was detained on suspicion of \"inciting hatred\" for interviewing a volunteer critical of the government's rescue effort and later released, according to RSF.. The number of other journalists under investigation is unclear. On Tuesday, the police said they detained 134 people over \"provocative posts\" and arrested 25 of them, but their identities have not been disclosed. Some of those detained may well have been spreading falsehoods, including one that Afghan migrants had been scavenging in ruined neighbourhoods.. But critics say the clampdown has gone far beyond those spreading harmful disinformation. . \"The government is trying to suppress information coming from the quake zone,\" says cyber rights expert Yaman Akdeniz who teaches at the Istanbul Bilgi University. . The arrests came after Turkey's presidential communications director warned against \"lethal disinformation\" jeopardising the rescue efforts. The directorate also rolled out a smartphone app called \"Disinformation Reporting Service\" encouraging people to report manipulative posts about the quake. . \"Any time [Turkish] officials and the government are being criticised, they don't like it,\" says Arzu Geybulla, a journalist in Istanbul covering digital authoritarianism and censorship.. \"But this time they are perhaps more vocal.\". The BBC contacted Turkey's presidential directorate for communications asking about the journalists investigated and the calls by advocacy groups to drop investigations, but has had no response. . ",
