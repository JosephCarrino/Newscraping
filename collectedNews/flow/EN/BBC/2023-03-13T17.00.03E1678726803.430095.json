        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. More broadly across the whole Donetsk region, seven residents were injured altogether on Monday, Mr Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the enemy had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line, with an increase in the number of attacks. Mr Haidai added that Russian troops were also continuing to bring more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. There were also widespread reports of shelling across much of the Donbas region.. ",

        "content": "But the $8bn (Â£6.6bn) proposal faced a torrent of online activism in recent weeks, particularly among youth activists on TikTok.. Opponents argue it should be halted over its climate and wildlife impacts.. Located on Alaska's remote North Slope, it is the largest oil project in the region for decades.. It is slated to produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.. According to US Bureau of Land Management estimates, that means it will generate up to 278 million metric tonnes of CO2e over its 30-year lifetime - the equivalent of adding two million cars to US roads every year.. CO2e is a unit used to express the climate impact of all greenhouse gases together, as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide.. Environmental activists have argued the project's approval is inconsistent with President Biden's pledges to lead on climate action.. More than one million letters of protest have been written to the White House, and a Change.org petition calling for Willow to be halted drew more than three million signatures.. But all three lawmakers who represent Alaska in Congress, including one Democrat, pushed for the project's approval, touting it as a much-needed investment in the region's communities.. They also argued it would help boost domestic energy production and lessen the country's reliance on foreign oil.. So why has a president who has embraced strong action on climate change just approved a project dubbed a \"carbon bomb\"?. It's because Willow is all about politics and the law - and not the environment. . While running as a candidate back in 2020, Joe Biden promised that there would be \"no more drilling on federal lands, period\". That promise was broken last year when the administration announced plans to sell drilling leases, under pressure from the courts. . The White House will likely say that the role of the courts has also influenced the Willow decision.. Oil company ConocoPhillips have held the lease since 1999 and would have had a strong case to appeal if their plans had been turned down. . The Biden administration is obviously aware that, from a purely climate perspective, the project can't really be justified. So, as a sop to opponents, they've tried to balance the approval with new bans on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean. . Most environmentalists aren't buying that trade off.. Willow is also deeply political.. With a presidential election in 18 months, Mr Biden is keen to be seen as a centrist, concerned about gas supply and prices for US citizens.. But, in giving the green light to drilling, he now risks the support of many young people who voted for him in large numbers in 2020. . ",

        "content": "WATCH: The must-see moments from this year's Oscars. The dazzling multiverse adventure won seven awards including best picture, director and original screenplay.. Accepting her statuette, Yeoh said: \"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities.. \"And ladies, don't let anybody tell you that you are ever past your prime.\". Yeoh's co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis triumphed in the supporting actor and actress categories. In the history of the Oscars, no other film has ever won best picture, best director and three acting prizes.. In Everything Everywhere All at Once, Yeoh plays a Chinese-American laundrette owner who is mired in a tax audit, stuck in a crumbling marriage and struggling to connect with her daughter Joy.. But when she discovers different versions of herself in the multiverse, she must tap into their skills in order to save the world.. \"This is proof that dreams do come true,\" Yeoh said in her speech. \"I have to dedicate this to all the moms in the world because they are the superheroes, and without them, none of us would be here tonight.\". The 60-year-old enjoyed a late surge in momentum in this year's Oscars race, ultimately overtaking the early frontrunner Cate Blanchett.. Yeoh is only the second woman of colour to win best leading actress, following Halle Berry for Monster's Ball more than two decades ago.. Best leading actress has historically been far less diverse than the supporting actress category, where Ariana DeBose, Yuh-jung Youn, Regina King, Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong'o and Octavia Spencer have won in the past decade.. Elsewhere, Brendan Fraser capped his extraordinary comeback after years away from the Hollywood spotlight by winning best actor for his performance in The Whale.. Thanking the film's director, the 54-year-old said: \"I'm grateful to Darren Aronofsky for throwing me a creative lifeline.\". \"I just wanted to say thank you for this acknowledgement,\" he said.. Addressing his fellow nominees, he said: \"You laid your whale-sized hearts so we could see into your souls, like no-one else could do, and it is my honour to be named alongside you in this category.\". Fraser was a huge film star at the turn of the millennium, starring in films such as George of the Jungle and The Mummy.. But he spent years out of the spotlight as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, mostly taking on smaller roles. . That changed when he was cast in The Whale as an overweight professor trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter.. Fraser transformed his appearance for the film, which also won best make-up and hairstyling.. This video can not be played. WATCH: Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis make emotional speeches. Much like Fraser, best supporting actor winner Quan has enjoyed a comeback narrative this awards season. The actor catapulted back into the spotlight thanks to his role in Everything Everywhere All at Once.. He told the audience: \"Dreams are something you have to believe in - I almost gave up on mine.\". The 51-year-old took an extended break from acting after rising to fame as a child star in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.. In an emotional speech, the Vietnamese-American actor said: \"They say stories like this only happen in the movies - I cannot believe it is happening to me. This is the American dream.. \"My journey started on a boat, I spent a year in a refugee camp, and somehow I ended up here, on Hollywood's biggest stage... Thank you so much for welcoming me back.\". Curtis won the first Oscar of her 45-year acting career by scoring best supporting actress - one of the tightest categories of the night.. \"I know it looks like I'm standing up here by myself but I am not, I am hundreds of people,\" Curtis said in her acceptance speech. \"The entire group of artists who made this movie - we just won an Oscar.\". Everything Everywhere also won best editing, best original screenplay and best directing for Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert - jointly known as Daniels.. Accepting best picture, Kwan said \"I realised growing up that one of the things we can do for each other is shelter each other from the chaos of this crazy world that we live in. Thank you to the storytellers who did that for me.\". All Quiet on the Western Front, Netflix's German-language World War One epic, finished the night in second place with four awards - best international feature, original score, production design and cinematography.. Its success at the Oscars follows a string of technical wins at the Baftas, but the film failed to replicate its British victory in the top category.. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio was named best animated feature. The Mexican filmmaker said: \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre and animation is ready to be taken to the next step.\". Wakanda Forever's Ruth E Carter repeated the best costume design victory she scored with the original Black Panther. She dedicated the prize to her mother, who died aged 101 last week.. There was a British win for The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse. The adaptation of the illustrated Charlie Mackesy book, which aired on BBC One over Christmas, won best animated short. . The award for best documentary feature went to Navalny, about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the events related to his 2020 poisoning.. In his speech, director Daniel Roher dedicated the award to Navalny, who has been imprisoned for two years, saying: \"Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to the world.\". Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, added: \"Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free, stay strong my love.\". There was a win in the best sound category for Top Gun: Maverick - one of the biggest box office hits of the past year - . Elsewhere at the ceremony, a dressed-down Lady Gaga sang a stripped-back rendition of Hold My Hand (from Top Gun: Maverick) while Rihanna sang Lift Me Up (from Wakanda Forever).. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony was hosted by US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel, who opened with a monologue which reflected on the past 12 months in the film industry.. \"They say Hollywood is running out of ideas. I mean, poor Steven Spielberg had to make a movie about Steven Spielberg,\" he joked, referring to the director's autobiographical best picture nominee The Fabelmans.. He also made jokes about .  - commenting that the character was \"the first superhero to be defeated by the accounting department\".. The US comic described Avatar: The Way of Water as \"another opportunity for James Cameron to do what he loves doing more than anything else - drowning Kate Winslet\" (the actress also appeared in Cameron's Titanic).. \"It was a big year for diversity and inclusion,\" Kimmel continued, \"we have nominees from every corner of Dublin.\" The Banshees of Inisherin had four acting nominations, including Colin Farrell and Kerry Condon.. \"Five Irish actors are nominated tonight which means the odds of another fight on stage just went way up.\". Finally, Kimmel referenced the event that overshadowed last year's ceremony: . \"If anyone here commits an act of violence during the show, you will be awarded best actor,\" Kimmel said, to much laughter, \"and permitted to give a 19-minute speech\"..
