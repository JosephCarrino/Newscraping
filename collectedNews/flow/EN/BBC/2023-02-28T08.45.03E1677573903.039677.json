        "content": "\"The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions\", Mr Zelensky stated.. The Ukrainian leader's remarks came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China against arming Russia during a visit to Kyiv on Monday.. Some of the fiercest fighting to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a year ago has taken place in Bakhmut, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, part of which is under the control of Russia and its separatist allies.. Recently efforts by Russian forces to capture the industrial city have intensified, with its troops gaining ground.. The separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, said \"practically all roads\" into the city were \"under [Russian] fire control\".. And the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the situation around Bakhmut was \"extremely tense\". . \"Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defences of our troops and surround the city,\" Gen Syrskyi said.. Speaking about the situation in his nightly address, President Zelensky said managing to gain a foothold in Bakhmut and ensuring its defence were being heavily compromised by Russia's renewed onslaught.. He was \"grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding\" the area.. President Zelensky also called once again for modern combat aircraft to be sent so that \"the entire territory of our country\" can be defended from \"Russian terror\".. On her surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, Janet Yellen announced the latest transfer of $1.25bn (£1bn) in economic and budget aid to Ukraine.. Ms Yellen reiterated US President Joe Biden's message - made during .  - that Washington would stand with Ukraine for as long as it took to win the war.. , Ms Yellen added that while Russia's economy had not yet buckled under the vast sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers, she expected it to grow weaker over time.. She also stated that Russia's ability to replenish military equipment destroyed in attacks on Ukraine was being \"gradually jeopardized\", adding that any move from China to supply such weaponry to Russia would lead to \"severe\" consequences.. \"We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,\" she said. . \"And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.\". Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said . . Beijing strongly denied the claim.. A meeting between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week looked to many to be an indication of China's close ties with Russia.. And Mr Putin's staunch ally, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, is scheduled to begin a three day tour of China on Tuesday. During the visit he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping. .

        "content": "China's foreign ministry hit back that the global outbreak's origin \"was about science and should not be politicised\".. Washington-Beijing ties have been under strain since the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon this month.. Ambassador Nicholas Burns told a US Chamber of Commerce event on Monday that China needs to \"be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis\".. US media reported on Sunday that a report from the US Department of Energy had concluded in a classified intelligence report with \"low confidence\" that the virus was accidentally leaked by a laboratory. . The energy department had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.. Other US agencies have drawn differing conclusions, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings. The FBI in 2021 concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that the virus leaked from a lab. . Other studies suggest it made the leap from animals to humans at Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market.. An .  released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday there was still no firm finding either way.. \"There has not been a definitive conclusion and consensus in the US government on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" he told reporters when asked about the energy department's reported determination.. A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry on Monday again rejected the lab leak theory.. Mao Ning called on US investigators to \"stop smearing China and stop politicising origins-tracing\".. After it was reported that the US energy department had settled on the lab leak theory, Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted \"being proven right doesn't matter\". . \"What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn't happen again.\". Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton told CNN he was \"not entirely surprised\" by the energy department's reported conclusion. . \"The Chinese have mishandled Covid at every step of the way, [and] are trying to sweep it under the rug,\" he said..

The shooting happened after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian villages .  with dozens of cars and houses burned.. That attack came after two settlers, from a nearby village, were shot dead by a Palestinian on Sunday.. The Israeli-American man killed near Jericho was taken by paramedics to a hospital in Jerusalem, but was later pronounced dead. . US Ambassador Tom Nides .  \"Sadly, I can confirm that a US citizen was killed in one of the terror attacks in the West Bank tonight. I pray for his family.\". The Israeli Defence Forces said attackers opened fire on Israeli vehicles on three occasions, and later set their own vehicles on fire.. There was an exchange of fire with police before the attackers fled, the IDF tweeted.. There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any Palestinian groups. . Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip but is less prominent in the West Bank, said the attack was a natural response to Israeli attacks.. \"The crimes conducted by the occupation and the herds of settlers will not be met but with stabbing, shooting and car ramming,\" a spokesman said in a statement.. The violence came after Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a . Videos posted hours after the summit ended on Sunday showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara on Sunday night. . This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\".. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis.. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don't take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement.. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles south of Nablus.. The brothers were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times.. No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions' Den.. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in .  in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005.. Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians.. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 14 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer..

In a statement provided to BBC News on Monday, Fox said Dominion's lawsuit \"mischaracterizes the facts by cherry-picking soundbites, omitting key context, and mischaracterizing the record\"..
