        "content": "The earthquake, untroubled by international borders, has brought havoc to both countries. But the international relief effort has been thwarted by checkpoints. In southern Turkey, thousands of rescue workers with heavy lifting gear, paramedics and sniffer dogs have jammed the streets, and are still working to find survivors. In this part of opposition-held north-west Syria, none of this is going on. . I had just crossed the border from four days in the city of Antakya, Turkey, where the aid response is a cacophony - ambulance sirens blare all night long, dozens of earth movers roar and rip apart concrete 24 hours a day. Among the olive groves in the village of Bsania, in Syria's Idlib province, there's mostly silence.. The homes in this border area were newly built. Now more than 100 have gone, turned to aggregate and a ghostly white dust which gusts across the farmland. As I climb over the chalky remains of the village, I spot a gap in the ruin. Inside, a pink-tiled bathroom sits perfectly preserved. . The earthquake swallowed Abu Ala's home, and claimed the lives of two of his children. . \"The bedroom is there, that's my house,\" he says, pointing to pile of rubble. \"My wife, daughter and I were sleeping here - Wala', the 15-year-old girl, was at the edge of the room towards the balcony. A bulldozer was able to find her, [so] I took her and buried her.\" . In the dark, he and his wife clung to olive trees as aftershocks rocked the hillside. . The Syrian Civil Defence Force - also known as the White Helmets - which operates in opposition-held areas, did what they could with pickaxes and crowbars. The rescuers, who receive funding from the British government, lack modern rescue equipment.. Abu Ala' breaks down when he describes the search for his missing 13-year-old son, Ala'. \"We kept digging until evening the next day. May God give strength to those men. They went through hell to dig my boy up.\" . He buried the boy next to his sister. . Bsania wasn't much, but it was home. Rows of modern apartment buildings, with balconies facing out across the Syrian countryside into Turkey. Abu Ala' describes it as a thriving community. \"We had nice neighbours, nice people. [They] are dead now.\". A deeply religious man, he is now bereft. \"What am I going to do?\" he asks. \"There are no tents, no aid, nothing. We've received nothing but God's mercy until now. And I'm here left to roam the streets.\" . As we leave, he asks me if I have a tent. But we have nothing to give him. . I meet up with the White Helmets, expecting to find them looking for survivors. But it is too late. Ismail al Abdullah, is weary from effort, and what he describes as the world's disregard for the Syrian people. He says the international community has blood on its hands. . \"We stopped looking for survivors after more than 120 hours passed,\" he says. \"We tried our best to save our people, but we couldn't. No-one listened to us. . \"From the first hour we called for urgent action, for urgent help. No-one responded. They were just saying, 'We are with you', nothing else. We said, we need equipment. No-one responded.\" . Apart from a few Spanish doctors, no international aid teams have reached this part of Syria. It is an enclave of resistance from Bashar al-Assad's rule. Under Turkish protection, it is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group that was once affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has cut those links, but almost all governments have no relations with them. For our entire time in Syria, armed men, who didn't want to be filmed, accompanied us and stood at a distance. . More than a decade into Syria's stalled civil war, the 1.7m people who live in this area continue to oppose President Assad's rule. They live in makeshift camps and newly built shelters. Most have been displaced more than once, so life here was already very hard before the earthquake. . The international help that reaches this part of Syria is tiny. Many of the earthquake victims were taken to the Bab al-Hawa hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. They treated 350 patients in the immediate aftermath, general surgeon Dr Farouk al Omar tells me, all with only one ultrasound. . When I ask him about international aid, he shakes his head, and laughs. \"We cannot talk more about this topic. We spoke about that a lot. And nothing happened. Even in a normal situation, we don't have enough medical staff. And just imagine what it's like in this catastrophe after earthquake,\" he says. . At the end of the corridor, a tiny baby lies in an incubator. Mohammad Ghayyath Rajab's skull is bruised and bandaged, and his small chest rises and falls thanks to a respirator. Doctors can't be sure, but they think he's around three months old. Both of his parents were killed in the earthquake, and a neighbour found him crying alone in the dark in the rubble of his home. . The Syrian people have been forsaken many times, and tell me they have grown used to being disregarded. But still there is anger that more help is not forthcoming. . In the town of Harem, Fadel Ghadab lost his aunt and cousin. . \"How is it possible that the UN has sent a mere 14 trucks worth of aid?\" he asks. \"We've received nothing here. People are in the streets.\" . More aid has made it into Syria, but not much and it is too little, too late. . In the absence of international rescue teams in Harem, children remove rubble. A man and two boys use a car-jack to prize apart the collapsed remains of a building, carefully salvaging animal feed onto a blanket. Life isn't cheaper in Syria, but it is more precarious.. The day is ending and I have to leave. I cross the border back into Turkey and soon get stuck in a traffic jam or ambulances, construction equipment - the gridlock of a national and international aid response. . My phone pings with a message from a Turkish rescuer telling me his team found a woman alive after 132 hours buried under her home. Behind me in Syria, as darkness falls, there is only silence. . ",

        "content": "Meanwhile, unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places. . The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 33,000.. More arrests are expected - but the action will be seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. . Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.. With elections looming, .  after spending 20 years in power.. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone, he appeared to blame fate. \"Such things have always happened,\" he said. \"It's part of destiny's plan.\". On the sixth day after the quake hit, the situation is growing more desperate. . On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province. Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.. \"There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,\" Austrian Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said. \"The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.\". The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. On Sunday, the number dead in Turkey rose to more than 29,000.. Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. . Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening.. The border crossing between Turkey and Armenia reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "We stop at a small place we learn is called Ördekdede and stumble into a Turkish community where their dead now outnumber the living.. This is a grim new reality for so many dots of the map across the huge corridor of this region where the ground shook most violently.. The last people we expect to find among the survivors in this secluded spot - huddling around a fire, sipping tea - are two Londoners.. Mehmet and Fatma Meter are from Finsbury Park, north London.. \"This earthquake has destroyed everything,\" says Fatma, as she wipes tears with her scarf. . \"We arrived in Turkey before the earthquake for my brother's funeral,\" Mehmet explains. . \"But now we've had to bury seven of our family.\" . They take us on a journey to document where each precious life was lost.  . So we pick our way through their decimated community, which is now a grotesque jumble of broken bricks, twisted metal and dusty rubble.. Fatma leads us along the path before stopping, pointing to a corner of the wreckage where she says the first of three relatives perished.. \"We tried to save them. The voice was coming from there, so [we] rushed to help. Ali was shouting from under the rubble, 'save me, save me'. . \"We saved Ali. But Shemse, Kamel, Ayshe, there was no answer, nothing.\". Kamel and Semse were man and wife, their daughter Ayshe just 16. Their 20-year-old old son, Alican, is the only survivor from the house and is now in hospital with a broken leg.. \"Just one day before we ate dinner together,\" Fatma says.. \"One day later all of these people die. How can I believe it?\". Fatma shakes her head as she relives how she helped to carry the bodies from the debris and took them away for the burial.. Among the many heaps of bricks now crowned with a twisted piece of corrugated iron are the remains of Mehmet's father's house.. It's hard to imagine anyone getting out alive.. But 87-year-old Abdi Meter did.. \"His chair fell against a wall and opened up a way for him to escape. I can't believe he did it.\". It is a few steps up the road where Mehmet stops in his tracks and reveals the picture in his mind that is haunting him.. The image of his young nephew Umut Efe's body.. \"A sofa was pushing him up towards the sky. And then I saw his face looking me in the eyes. He had passed two days ago and his colour had changed. He was nearly five.\". The memory is too raw and he waves his hand in front of his face before turning away sobbing.. If there is any possible small mercy in this scene of ruination, it's that the earthquake struck in winter when fewer homes in the village were occupied. . During the summer, it's a different story as members of the Turkish diaspora in France, Germany as well as the UK return to see relatives and enjoy a nourishing dose of nostalgia from their childhoods.. Just along the road we find Siho Yukselir, a lorry driver who has spent the last 30 years calling London home, living in Golders Green.. As he contemplates the wreckage of his own family's house, he conveys the disbelief and anger that's characterised so many people we've met over the past few days.. \"I'm very very shocked. I can't stop crying. I was born in this village\" he tells us.. \"I lost everything. No insurance, no nothing and the government's not helping. You have to do it yourself again.\". For now, in the depths of grief and exhaustion, rebuilding this shattered community feels like an overwhelming, maybe impossible, task.. Before we leave Ördekdede, we ask Fatima and Mehmet when they will fly back to the UK. . Fatima pauses.. \"How can I do it? I don't know. How can I go back to London?\". With Turkey in this desperate state, she cannot leave her homeland.. ",

Northland declared a state of emergency then too over fears of unprecedented rain, but those concerns proved to be unfounded.. This time, however, gale force winds and heavy rain has been reported, leaving thousands of people without power. They have been warned that it may take days for power to be restored. . \"This is a serious event for New Zealand,\" meteorologist Georgina Griffiths told Radio New Zealand. . People who knew their homes were flood-prone were advised to evacuate ahead of the storm's arrival. . Declaring a state of emergency gives local authorities greater power to respond to dangerous situations and allows them to restrict travel and provide aid.. Further south in the country's largest city, Auckland, authorities issued a red weather alert - meaning severe gales, flooding and land slips are possible. . Schools have once again been advised to move learning online, trains have been cancelled and emergency shelters have been set up in preparation for the storm. . Air New Zealand, the country's national carrier, has announced it would cancel multiple long-haul international fights, Tasman and Pacific Island flights, and domestic services in and out of Auckland planned for Monday, when the worst of the bad weather is expected. . Thousands of homes suffered damage in January's record-breaking rainfall, which caused severe flooding and landslides, and four people died.. Residents are on high alert as they have been warned that the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure from the recent deluge could mean parts of the city will flood again more easily.. They have been using sandbags to try and people protect their houses and long queues have been forming at supermarkets after the authorities advised people to have enough supplies to last at least three days in case the situation deteriorated. . \"The water was knee-deep,\" one man who was filling up sandbags and a public facility told Television New Zealand. \"You never know what`s going to happen in the next two days.\". \"We had the creak behind us burst its banks, and it was pretty much against our back fence,\" said another. . New Zealand's prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has asked people to take the severe weather warnings seriously and to make sure they are prepared. . \"Central and local government have been working very closely to prepare for this event and also to make sure the early lessons that can be captured from our response a week or two back can be incorporated into this one.\". Thousands of people are already reported to be without power on the Coromandel Peninsula - where major roads connecting the mainly rural communities have been closed or are under warnings. . Residents in vulnerable areas there and in Tairāwhiti have also been urged to seriously consider evacuating..

Storm Gabrielle hits New Zealand. The tiny Australian territory of Norfolk Island, which lies north of New Zealand, had a lucky escape after the storm's most destructive winds bypassed it. . Norfolk Island's emergency controller, George Plant, told ABC News there were some emergency calls but that an initial assessment suggests the damage was \"manageable\". . \"We're feeling very fortunate as a community that we didn't cop the full brunt of what Gabrielle had to offer,\" resident Hannah Taylor said. . \"If she had moved a few a little bit south, we would have seen a lot more damage.\".

The increase comes as Ukrainian officials say that Russia has launched a \"big offensive\".. However, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC), Oleksiy Danilov, also said Russia is experiencing \"big problems\" with the campaign. . \"Our troops are repulsing [the offensive] very strongly,\" Mr Danilov said. \"The offensive they planned is already taking place, gradually, but it's not the offensive they imagined.\". Last week, Ukraine's outgoing defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said they were anticipating a new Russian offensive .  - the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. . Some of the fiercest fighting has been around Bakhmut in the east of the country.. On Sunday, the head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said the group had seized a settlement near the devastated city.. Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Telegram: \"Today, the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by assault detachments of the Wagner PMC.\" . Mr Prigozhin also gave his group credit for the offensive on Bakhmut, downplaying the Russian army's role: \"Within a radius of 50 km, plus or minus, there are only Wagner PMC fighters,\" he wrote. .

        "content": "While he didn't say specifically that the two latest objects were Chinese, Mr Schumer told ABC on Sunday that Beijing was likely using a \"crew of balloons\" that had \"probably been all over the world\".. Responding to queries about Mr Schumer's remarks, a spokesperson for the US Department of Defense said the latest two objects \"did not closely resemble\" the original balloon and were much smaller, Reuters reported.. Three objects have been shot down over North America in the past week. . Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that the latest object was shot down on Saturday over the Yukon in north-west Canada.. Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track the object, which Mr Trudeau said had \"violated Canadian airspace\". It was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Trudeau said recovery teams were on the ground trying to find the object and that there was still \"much to know\".. Separately, on Friday, the American military shot down an object the size of a small car off Alaska.. It happened just under a week after the US . .. Mr Schumer, who said he had been briefed by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, implied that suspected surveillance balloons had been in operation for years and that Congress should examine why it took so long for the US to find out about them.. \"The bottom line is, until a few months ago we didn't know of these balloons - our intelligence and our military didn't know,\" he said. . Asked whether China would have to shut down any surveillance programme using balloons, Mr Schumer said Beijing had been \"humiliated\".. \"I think the Chinese were caught lying, and it's a real step back for them… they look really bad,\" he said.. \"They're not just doing the United States, this is a crew of balloons... they've probably been all over the world,\" he added.. China has yet to respond to Mr Schumer's comments but has denied the first suspected surveillance balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. Referring to the efforts to take out the latest object on Saturday, the White House, which was in communication with Canada, said in a statement that the object had been tracked and monitored for 24 hours. . \"Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,\" it said. . \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\". Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.. Meanwhile, continuing efforts to find and recover Friday's object near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse are being hampered by poor weather.. The US military said in a statement that \"Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety\".. Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the first Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. The US said the balloon - shown in the video below - was part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that had flown over five continents.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.. Chinese officials have accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\".. In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the situation, maintaining that the balloon was not \"a major breach\".. ",
