        "content": "Last December he appeared to predict Russia would attack Ukraine.. He claimed to have had eight Covid-19 vaccinations. He contracted coronavirus and died weeks after being admitted to hospital with pneumonia.. His death was finally confirmed by parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on Wednesday, after two reports earlier this year had been discounted. . Zhirinovsky was, he said, always in the thick of things: \"A man who deeply understood how the world works and foresaw a lot.\". Zhirinovsky's brand of clownish ultranationalism kept Russians shocked and entertained during more than 30 years of his political career. . In the early 1990s he claimed he dreamt of the day \"when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean\". In one of his final appearances before MPs, he said Russia would invade Ukraine and predicted almost to the day when it would happen.. \"At 04:00 on 22 February you'll feel [our new policy]. I'd like 2022 to be peaceful. But I love the truth, for 70 years I've said the truth. It won't be peaceful. It will be a year when Russia once again becomes great.\". His career was laced with similar threats to other countries, from the Baltics and Germany to Japan and the Middle East. He achieved international notoriety when he threw juice in the face of a political rival, Boris Nemtsov, during a TV debate.. Before he entered politics, he ran a Soviet state-approved Jewish cultural organisation. His Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was the country's first official post-communist political party and was widely viewed first as a Soviet stooge. Russians and the West were shocked when his party won Russia's first democratic elections in 1993.. Political commentator Konstantin Eggert labelled him \"the Kremlin's pocket nationalist and scandal-monger\". With hindsight, said Eggert, his success in 1993 was a precursor of the \"barbaric revanchism\" that had led to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. Zhirinovsky told the BBC in 2018 that Ukraine was Russian territory: \"It's our territory; it's our people. It's part of our country.\". His career had declined in recent years - even though his party is widely viewed favourably by the Kremlin. . He secured a mere 5.6% of the vote in a 2018 presidential election that was marred by irregularities and by a ban on Russia's leading opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who is now in jail.. When a respected Russian journalist accused Zhirinovsky in 2018 of groping him 12 years earlier, the politician's son condemned the remarks as slander..

        "content": "Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, had claimed the \"Oh I\" hook in Sheeran's track was \"strikingly similar\" to an \"Oh why\" refrain in his own track.. After the ruling, Sheeran said such \"baseless\" claims \"are way too common\".. In a video on social media, he said there was now a culture \"where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim\".. He added: \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music.. \"Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year and there's only 12 notes that are available.\". Shape of You was the UK's best-selling song of 2017 in the UK and is Spotify's most-streamed ever.. Judge Antony Zacaroli ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song.. He acknowledged there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\" in Shape of You and Oh Why, but said \"such similarities are only a starting point for a possible infringement\" of copyright.. After studying the musical elements, he said there were \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs, which \"provide compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".. He added that there was only a \"speculative foundation\" for the defence's case that Sheeran had heard Chokri's song before writing Shape of You. \"I find, as a matter of fact, that he had not heard it,\" he said.. Sheeran wrote his chart-topping track with two collaborators, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, who all denied having previously heard Oh Why.. The case dates back to 2018, when the trio asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed the copyright of Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. That led to an 11-day trial in London last month.. This ruling will come as a huge relief to Ed Sheeran, who took the unusual step of pre-emptively suing Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue in 2018 in an attempt to clear his name. . He was stung by the accusation that he'd deliberately copied another writer's work without giving them credit. On the witness stand, the star was often terse and abrupt as he explained how, in several other instances, he shared royalties with writers who inspired him. Even on Shape of You, he protested, some of the profits went to the writers of TLC's No Scrubs.. He later sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good and Blackstreet's No Diggity on the stand in an attempt to prove the melody he was accused of stealing was commonplace in pop music.. Chokri was more emotional. He said he felt \"robbed\" by an artist he respected, and that he wished the trial had never come to court. However, he remained adamant that Sheeran had heard and copied his song.. In the end, the judge disagreed. In order for copyright infringement to be proved, Chokri needed to prove that Sheeran had listened to his song - otherwise the similarities would just be coincidence. But Mr Justice Zacaroli said Chokri's team had failed to establish that Oh Why had ever graced Sheeran's speakers. . As a star who has faced his fair share of copyright claims, Sheeran will presumably hope this verdict makes future litigants think twice. . The Shape of You songwriters took legal action in 2018 after the track's royalties were frozen when Chokri and O'Donoghue asked the Performing Rights Society (PRS) to add them to the hit's credits as co-writers.. Shape of You earns Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon about Â£5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments having being frozen due to the dispute.. In his ruling, Mr Justice Zacaroli said Sheeran and his collaborators were justified in thinking the request from Chokri and O'Donoghue to be named as co-writers \"was a tactic designed to extract a settlement\".. After the initial legal action, Chokri and O'Donoghue launched a counter-claim alleging copyright infringement.. In a joint statement after the judgement, Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon said their mental health and creativity had suffered as a result of the case, as well as their wallets.. \"There was a lot of talk throughout this case about cost,\" they said. \"But there is more than just a financial cost. There is a cost on creativity. When we are tangled up in law suits, we are not making music or playing shows.. \"There is a cost on our mental health. The stress this causes on all sides is immense. It affects so many aspects of our everyday lives and the lives of our families and friends. We are not corporations. We are not entities. We are human beings.\". Giving evidence last month, Sheeran denied that he \"borrows\" ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement, insisting he was always \"completely fair\" in crediting people who contribute to his work.. Andrew Sutcliffe QC, representing Chokri and O'Donoghue, labelled Sheeran a \"magpie\", claiming he \"habitually copies\" other artists and that it was \"extremely likely\" he had previously heard Oh Why.. In closing arguments last month, Mr Sutcliffe said there was an \"indisputable similarity between the works\". But Sheeran's lawyer said the case against him was \"so strained as to be logically unintelligible\".. Forensic musicologists were called by both sides to argue the case, . . One said the songs were \"distinctly different\" but the other argued they contained \"significant similarities\".. Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, said .  for the star and his collaborators, while Chokri described the High Court case as \"the worst few weeks of my life\"..

        "content": "Mr Nazir was a partner at a law firm working in Singapore, where his family moved more than a decade ago. . His firm said he was a \"dear friend and colleague\".. Watson Farley & Williams said they would be \"remembering and honouring\" him.. The alarm was raised on Monday afternoon by the family's 15-year-old daughter after the landslide killed her father and younger brother, leaving her mother and older brother critically injured.. The teenage girl was said to be \"extremely distressed\" and is being kept in hospital under observation.. The two bodies were recovered from the mountains, near the popular walking spot of Wentworth Falls, about 60 miles (96km) from Sydney, at about 09:30 local time on Tuesday.. Tour guide Graham Chapman said landslides are common in the Blue Mountains and have been made more likely by recent heavy rain.. \"This beautiful family from England were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's so sad,\" he said.. \"Maybe another 50 metres either side or a delay during the day, this wouldn't have happened.\". Torrential rain has returned to the Blue Mountains. Thick bands of low cloud have moved in, obscuring buildings and bushland.  . As the rain beats down near Wentworth Falls, car headlights occasionally emerge from the mist. But this popular tourist destination is mostly quiet: walking tracks and some roads have been closed. . Months of heavy downpours are likely to have been a key factor in the tragedy involving the family of five from Britain. . They came on a day of rare sunshine in a year that's been dominated in much of eastern Australia by storms and floods. . In this World Heritage area, the ground is sodden and signs warn of the dangers of rockfalls and landslips. The earth and the famous sandstone cliffs have become saturated, and still it rains. . Landslides here are not uncommon - but rarely, if ever, have they devastated the lives of an entire family. . The family had set out on the hike on Monday in bright, sunny weather but the Blue Mountains had previously been lashed by weeks of heavy rain.. Mr Chapman said: \"I've seen so many landslides I couldn't tell you how many. But the thing is with landslides here in the mountains, you don't actually get to hear about them a lot because it's so remote.. \"Here in the mountains, it can change in the blink of an eye and sadly for the English family, that's exactly what happened the other day.\". He said he had cried when he heard the news of their deaths, adding: \"We've only just opened up our international borders, and to know that that family has come to our country and that this has happened on our soil, man, it's just heart breaking.\". The family are understood to be members of the Zoroastrian religion, . .. Zubin Appoo, president of the Australian Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales, said the accident was \"beyond tragic\". \"Everyone is shocked and so many in our community are reaching out to offer support in any way they can.\". Mr Appoo said tributes to the family were \"flooding in\", adding that the religion had a small and tight-knit global community.. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident was \"tragic\" and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open.. The Department of Environment and Heritage in the state said the area was closed to the public until further notice and a \"comprehensive review\" would be undertaken.. It said it had a \"world-class\" programme in place to assess the risks of incidents such as landslides but \"it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks\".. The walking trail had been inspected days before the landslide as part of a routine assessment, the department said.. The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell.

Tamya Cox-Toure, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said in a statement the bill serves as an \"alarming reminder that the days of access to safe and legal abortion may be numbered, and we must continue to fight to guarantee all people have access to the essential health care they need, including abortion\". . Republican dominated legislatures have been passing a series of restrictive abortion measures in recent years, designed to set up a showdown in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. . The court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law which could see conservative justices overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion under federal law in 1973. .

But on Wednesday, Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando told lawmakers: \"As a responsible Government, we state President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will not resign from his post under any circumstances.\". On Tuesday night, Mr Rajapaksa lifted controversial state of emergency measures following further protests, the departure of several government lawmakers and the resignation of his finance minister.. The president had invoked the law - which allows the arrest of suspects without warrants - on 1 April after protests outside his house..

Public frustration over the crisis has seen peaceful demonstrations held since January.. But the situation has escalated in the last fortnight, with many more people taking to the streets as power cuts stretched to 13 hours and petrol stations ran out of fuel.. \"People can't afford their daily rice, their dhal, their basic necessities.

While most protests are peaceful, there have also been violent flare-ups - with attacks on politicians' homes and clashes between protesters and police.. This video can not be played. On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Council expressed its concerns about the emergency measures in a statement issued before they were lifted.. The UN noted the reports of police violence and said it was worried the restrictions aimed at \"preventing or discouraging people from legitimately expressing their grievances through public protests\"..
