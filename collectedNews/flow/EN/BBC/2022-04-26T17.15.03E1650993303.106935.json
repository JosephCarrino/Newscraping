        "content": "In March, North Korea tested its largest-known ICBM for the first time since 2017.. It sparked wide condemnation from the international community.. The US also imposed several sanctions on the country after the test. ICBMs, designed for nuclear arms delivery, extend North Korea's strike range as far as the US mainland. . The parade also featured submarine-launched ballistic missiles in addition to hypersonic missiles. . However, Mr Kim has been undeterred by the condemnation so far. . \"We will continue to take steps to strengthen and develop our nation's nuclear capabilities at the fastest pace,\" he said, adding that their nuclear forces \"must be ready\" to be exercised anytime, according to a report by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).. North Korea's nuclear weapons were fundamentally a deterrence tool against war but could be used for other means, he said, echoing previous rhetoric that the country would strike back if attacked.. Kim Jong-un wants North Korea to be accepted as a legitimate nuclear state. He also wants the crippling sanctions on his country to be lifted. But he knows neither are likely to happen. . Diplomacy with the US has stalled. President Biden has said he will only look at lifting sanctions if North Korea agrees to give up its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un has responded by forging ahead with his nuclear programme, testing an array of increasingly sophisticated weapons. . North Korea has always claimed the reason it has nuclear weapons is to prevent a war. But recently it has started to talk about using these weapons in battle. This was the suggestion in Mr Kim's speech, when he vowed that any military seeking confrontation with North Korea would \"cease to exist\". . But this show of force is as much about bolstering his popularity as it is his security. North Korea is not just isolated from the international community. It sealed itself off from the world during the pandemic, and its economy is in a bad way. Weapons are one area where Mr Kim can show his people he is making progress.. Parade pictures released by state media show that the Hwasong-17 was among the weapons displayed at the parade.  North Korea claimed to have test fired the massive ICBM . South Korean experts have questioned the success of the test launch.. Typically, Pyongyang showcases its new weapons at its military parades which often feature long processions of tanks, artillery and soldiers.. Monday's military parade was closely watched as North Korea has tested several missiles this year, heightening tensions on the peninsula.. In addition, satellite images have showed North Korea firing up activity at its nuclear testing facility in Punggye-ri in March, stoking fears the country would resume testing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.. The recent election of South Korea's new president Yoon Suk-yeol, who has voiced a harsher line on North Korea's actions, has frayed relations.. South Korean defence minister Suh Wook earlier this month said the South had the capacity to strike the North's missile launch points - sparking a furious reaction from Pyongyang.. In 2018 Kim Jong-un put in place a moratorium on long-range ballistic missile and nuclear tests, following talks with then US President Donald Trump.. But in 2020, Mr Kim announced he was no longer bound by this promise.. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has repeatedly said it is willing to resume talks without preconditions, but has so far shown little interest in engaging North Korea, which has demanded an end to sanctions.. Mr Biden has instead prioritised relations with South Korea and Japan, and thrown his support behind efforts by the South's outgoing president Moon Jae-in to smooth relations between the two countries. .

        "content": "Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza also released crime scene photos and witness interviews, including Mr Baldwin's. . But police said a decision on whether to file criminal charges will depend on the outcome of future forensic work. . Halyna Hutchins, 42, was shot by Mr Baldwin while he rehearsed with what he believed to be a safe gun.. The actor, who was also a producer on the film, previously said he did not pull the trigger and had no idea how a live bullet came to be on the set near Santa Fe in the US state of New Mexico. . In videos released on Monday, police and medics can be seen racing to the scene, and bodycam footage shows first responders battling to save Hutchins. . In other clips, Mr Baldwin is seen dressed as a cowboy and practising with what appears to be the gun that killed the cinematographer. . In a statement accompanying the release of the footage, Sheriff Mendoza said the investigation into the shooting \"remains open and ongoing\". . He said several components of the investigation remain outstanding, including firearms forensics, fingerprint analysis, a report from the medical examiner and analysis of Mr Baldwin's phone data. . \"Once these investigative components are provided to the sheriff's office we will be able to complete the investigation to forward it to the Santa Fe District Attorney for review,\" Sheriff Mendoza said. . According to the New York Times, a spokesperson for the Sante Fe sheriff's office said authorities had decided to release the files after multiple requests from the media and because investigators wanted to show what information remained outstanding before the case could be passed on to prosecutors. . Authorities have refused to rule out filing criminal charges over the incident and in October .  that \"everything at this point, including criminal charges, is on the table\".. The release comes a week after producers of the film were .  and charged the maximum fine of $136,793 (Â£105,000). . An investigation conducted by the New Mexico Environment Department found that the makers of the film showed \"plain indifference to recognised hazards associated with use of firearms on set\". . It added that the film's management \"knew that firearm safety procedures were not being followed on set and demonstrated plain indifference to employee safety by failing to review work practices and take corrective action\"..

        "content": "The comments came as Nordic media reported the countries could launch a simultaneous bid to join the security bloc next month.. Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. . But during a visit to Sweden earlier this month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said \"everything had changed\" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be \"prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia\". . Her comments coincided with the .  Finland's membership of Nato could result in \"increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia\". . Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Monday that the two countries' leaders could meet in the week of 16 May to announce the bid during a state visit to Sweden by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. . Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman .  with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead.. And there have been some reports that Russia had started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that.. But Swedish outlet Aftonbladet reported that the US and UK have agreed to provide security support during the application process, citing government officials. . US defence sources told the outlet that Sweden and Finland would be treated as de-facto members of the security alliance for the duration of the application process. . The UK and US support would reportedly include an increased number of troops in the Nordic nations, further intelligence co-operation, assistance in combatting cyber threats and an increased presence of Nato warships in the Baltic sea.. Last week Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said a wide-ranging security review being carried out by Stockholm will be completed by 13 May, rather than 31 May as initially planned. . She noted that with Finland's analysis now complete \"there is now a lot of pressure\" to urgently publish the report, and her party, the Social Democrats, are expected to drop their traditional opposition to joining the bloc. . Russia sees Nato as a threat to its security, and before the war in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the bloc removed its forces from Eastern European member states. . However, Russia's invasion has had the opposite effect, with Nato bolstering its forces in Eastern Europe and traditionally neutral countries now on the verge of joining the bloc. . Public sentiment in both Sweden and Finland towards Nato membership has changed dramatically since Russia launched its invasion over two months ago. . In Finland, opinion polls show that public support for joining bloc has climbed from 28% in February to 68% last month.. Meanwhile, 57% of Swedes now favour NATO membership, up from 51% in March..

        "content": "\"Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible,\" Boris Johnson's spokesman said.. The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he  must protect users.. \"Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding,\" Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet.. The European Union has said the new rules will \"overhaul\" the digital market, including how tech giants operate.. Once it comes into force, it means that there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example.. Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech. . \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" he said . The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation.. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". . But. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as \"the singular solution I trust\".. He said the firm had  \"owned\" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the \"correct first step\".. Twitter \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", he said, but added he did not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\".. But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\". Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.. The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (Â£34.5bn) offer. . Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain, according to the Reuters news agency.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. . Mr Musk said that he hopes that even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". . However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". . \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers.. Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". . \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added.. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expected most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". . \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said.  . On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", regardless of whoever owns or runs Twitter.. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\".. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as \"an encouraging day for freedom of speech\". . This video can not be played.
