        "content": "The officials say it could have been created to redistribute the pyramid's weight around the entrance or another as yet undiscovered chamber.. It was first detected in 2016 using an imaging technique called muography.. , which are by-products of cosmic rays that are only partially absorbed by stone. . The non-invasive technique detected an empty space behind the northern face of the Great Pyramid, about 7m above the main entrance, in an area where there is a stone chevron structure.. Further tests were carried out with radar and ultrasound before a 6mm-wide (0.24in) endoscope was fed through a tiny joint in-between the stones that make up the chevrons.. The footage from the camera was unveiled at a news conference beside the pyramid on Thursday. It showed an empty corridor with walls made out of roughly-hewn stone blocks and a vaulted stone ceiling.. \"We're going to continue our scanning so we will see what we can do... to figure out what we can find out beneath it, or just by the end of this corridor,\" said Mostafa Waziri, head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.. The Great Pyramid, which is 146m high, was built on the Giza plateau during the fourth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops, who reigned from around 2609BC to 2584BC.. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there is no consensus about how it was built.. Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass said the corridor represented a \"major discovery\" that would \"enter houses and homes of people all over the world for the first time\".. He also said that it might help reveal whether the burial chamber of King Khufu still existed inside the pyramid.. He speculated that there might be \"something important\" in the space below the corridor, then added: \"I'm sure in a few months from now we can see if what I'm saying is correct or not.\". . It is estimated to be 30m long and several metres in height and is located directly above the Grand Gallery.. ",

        "content": "Three of them have been sighted in a rainforest in the island's north-east, but in an unexpected habitat.. The ground-dwelling birds were in thick vegetation near a rocky river - perhaps a good spot to find grubs and insects.. \"If dusky tetraka always prefer areas close to rivers, this might help to explain why the species has been overlooked for so long,\" says ornithologist John Mittermeier who managed to take a photo of the rare bird.. He is the director of the lost birds programme at the American Bird Conservancy, which led this latest expedition in Madagascar.. The sighting of the dusky tetraka comes little over a year since .  - a collaboration between Re:wild, American Bird Conservancy (ABC) and BirdLife International, with data support from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and its eBird platform.. Although the birds' rainforest home is officially protected, the bird-watching expedition found that much of the forest had been converted into vanilla-producing farms, curtailing the dusky tetraka's natural habitat. .

        "content": "Meanwhile, a government minister said austerity during Greece's economic crisis in the 2000s contributed to a lack of investment in the railways.. Rail workers held a one-day strike on Thursday following the disaster, blaming government neglect. . The walkout follows protests in Athens, Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa, near the site of the disaster.. Rescue workers are still going through burned and buckled carriages there, searching for victims.. This was the \"most difficult moment\", rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters news agency, because \"instead of saving lives, we have to recover bodies\".. The incident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. A passenger train carrying 350 people collided with a freight train after both ended up on the same track - causing the front carriages to burst into flames.. The railway workers' strike began at 0600 local time (0400 GMT), affecting national rail services and the subway in Athens. . Many in Greece see the crash as an accident waiting to happen, and the union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. During a visit to a hospital where relatives of the missing had gathered, Zoe Rapti, Greece's Deputy Minister of Health, told the BBC that investing in the rail network had been made more difficult by the Greek debt crisis around 2010, which led to drastic austerity measures in exchange for a financial rescue by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. . \"Of course, things should have been done during these years but, as you remember, Greece faced a big economic crisis for more than 10 years, which means that many things went back,\" she said. . She said a \"wide investigation\" would take place, which she promised would provide answers. . Government spokesman Giannis Oikonomous also said \"chronic delays\" in implementing rail projects were rooted in \"distortions\" in the country's public sector going back decades. . A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court on Thursday. He has admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident, his lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said outside the courthouse.. \"He is literally devastated. Since the first moment, he has assumed responsibility proportionate to him,\" Mr Pantzartzidis said, hinting that the station master, who has not been publicly named, was not the only one to blame. . The country's transport minister has resigned over the incident, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system that was not fit for the 21st Century.. Meanwhile, the government has promised an independent investigation that it promises will deliver justice.. But Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's suggestion that \"tragic human error\" was to blame has caused anger. . On Wednesday, rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the headquarters of the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters, who threw stones and lit fires in the streets. . At a silent vigil in Larissa to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had been long coming.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. This video can not be played. Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. Many of the passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage - which burst into flames - had reached 1,300C (2,370F), making it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\".. Local media have reported that more than 10 people are still missing, as Greece observes three days of national mourning.. Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday.. One of those, a woman called Katerina searching for her missing brother, a passenger on the train, shouted \"Murderers!\" outside the hospital in Larissa, directing her anger towards the government and the rail company, Reuters reports.. Kostas Malizos, a recently retired surgeon and Emeritus Professor at Greece's University of Thessaly, has returned to work to perform surgery on injured passengers.. \"It's a disaster, it's catastrophic,\" he said. \"Families are crying tonight. Unfortunately, the majority of the lost people are young students. They left home, happy after the long weekend, to go for their studies or to see their relatives and never reached them.\".

        "content": "Russia's foreign minister accused the West of \"blackmail and threats\". . India had wanted to focus on other issues affecting developing nations, but it said the differences over Ukraine \"could not be reconciled\".. \"We tried, but the gap between the countries was too much,\" India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said. . The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. The group's foreign ministers - including Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Antony Blinken of the US and China's Qin Gang - were meeting in Delhi under India's presidency. It was the first face-to-face meeting of the top US and Russian diplomats since the war began, just over a year ago.. Mr Blinken met Mr Lavrov for about 10 minutes on the sidelines and told him the West would stand by Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", a senior state department official said. Mr Blinken also pressed Russia to rejoin the New Start nuclear arms control treaty that it recently withdrew from and abide by the terms.. Russian officials denied any negotiations had taken place. Earlier, Russia also accused the West of \"burying\" a deal to allow some Ukrainian grain exports - but the US countered by saying Moscow was hampering Ukrainian exports.. Meanwhile Russian officials said Moscow and Beijing had agreed to oppose what they called Western blackmail and threats - but this hasn't been confirmed by China. . \"We speak about manners. Well, our Western counterparts have gotten really bad with these,\" Mr Lavrov said after Thursday's talks. \"They are not thinking of diplomacy any more; they now only deal in blackmail and threatening everyone else.\". Indian PM Narendra Modi had opened the session, warning that global divisions were putting sustainable development at risk.. \"Many developing countries are struggling with unsustainable debts while trying to ensure food and energy security,\" he said.. \"They are also most affected by global warming caused by richer countries.\". It was a rare address by Mr Modi in English - a sign of how seriously he wanted his message to be taken. He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions. . Thursday's schedule included sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency. . Before the talks a former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make delegates overlook their differences on the war. Strained relations between the US and China, which has refused to oppose Russia's invasion, were also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.. In the end Foreign Minister Jaishankar had to present what's called a chair's summary after Thursday's talks, meaning participants had been unable to reach a joint statement. Russia and China were the only states which refused to agree to condemn the war.. But India did succeed in its main objective of raising a voice for the Global South and Mr Jaishankar said that \"on the bulk of issues we were able to get an outcome document\".. There are still several months left for diplomacy before G20 leaders meet in September and Delhi will hope it its presidency doesn't end on a disappointing note.. Experts say Delhi also had the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together. . India has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. It has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of its population.  . But it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.. ",
