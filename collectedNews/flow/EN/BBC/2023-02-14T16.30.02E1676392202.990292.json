        "content": "The BBC said that it was \"fully co-operating\" with authorities.. \"We hope to have this situation resolved as soon as possible,\" a short statement added.. Although the documentary was broadcast on television only in the UK, India's government has attempted to block people sharing . online, calling it \"hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage\" with a \"colonial mind-set\". . Last month, police in Delhi detained students as they . The documentary focused on the prime minister's role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state. . The general secretary of the opposition Congress party, KC Venugopal, said Tuesday's search \"reeks of desperation and shows that the Modi government is scared of criticism\". . \"We condemn these intimidation tactics in the harshest terms. This undemocratic and dictatorial attitude cannot go on any longer,\" he tweeted.. But Gaurav Bhatia, a spokesman from Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), described the BBC as the \"most corrupt organisation in the world\". . \"India is a country which gives an opportunity to every organisation,\" he said, \"as long as you don't spew venom.\". He added the searches were lawful and the timing had nothing to do with the government.. The Editors Guild of India - a non-profit group which promotes press freedom - said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the searches. . They are a \"continuation of a trend of using government agencies to intimidate and harass press organisations that are critical of government policies or the ruling establishment\", it said.. Amnesty International India's Board accused authorities of \"trying to harass and intimidate the BBC over its critical coverage of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\".. It said the \"overbroad powers of the Income Tax Department are repeatedly being weaponised to silence dissent\".. The documentary highlights a previously unpublished report, obtained by the BBC from the UK Foreign Office, which raises questions about Mr Modi's actions during . The rioting began the day after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire, killing dozens. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in the subsequent violence.. The Foreign Office report claims that Mr Modi was \"directly responsible\" for the \"climate of impunity\" that enabled the violence. . In 2005, the US denied Mr Modi a visa under a law that bars the entry of foreign officials seen to be responsible for \"severe violations of religious freedom\".. Mr Modi has long rejected accusations against him, and has not apologised for the riots. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel also said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.. The BBC said last month that the Indian government was offered a right to reply to the documentary but it declined.. The broadcaster said the film was \"rigorously researched\" and \"a wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions, including responses from people in the BJP\".. This video can not be played. From January: Students arrested before screening of BBC Modi documentary . The targeting of organisations seen as critical of the government is not uncommon in India. . In 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt its India operations, with the group accusing the government of pursuing a \"witch-hunt\" against human rights organisations.. Oxfam was also searched last year along with other local non-government organisations.. The Editors Guild of India said tax authorities raided four other media outlets in 2021, after they carried negative coverage of the government. .

        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spokeswoman. Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\", said US Northern Command.. The FBI is examining the items, which the US says were used to spy on sensitive military sites. . The US has shot down three more objects since the first one on 4 February.. \"Large sections of the structure\" were also recovered on Monday off the coast of South Carolina, military officials say.. About 30-40ft (9-12m) of the balloon's antennas are among the items found, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.. US officials said the high-altitude balloon originated in China and was used for surveillance, but China said it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown astray. . Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border.. In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-16 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources. . The second missile hit the target. Each Sidewinder missile costs over $400,000 (£330,000).. Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the first balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target. . White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down \"out of an abundance of caution\".. They did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\", he said.. The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses. . The second object, over Alaska, was described as the size of a \"small car\". The third object, over the Yukon, was \"cylindrical\". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be \"octagonal\" with strings attached. . A Pentagon memo later reported in US media said the flying object shot down over Yukon appeared to be a \"small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it\". . Defence officials also wrote in the memo that the object shot down in Michigan \"subsequently slowly descended\" into the water after impact.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. The recovery of the balloon shot down on 4 February was delayed amid foul weather.  . Efforts are under way to collect debris from where the other objects were blown out of the sky.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles), including \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sean McGillis said there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote locations. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost said all three of the most recent objects to be shot down appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discovered debris should contact the police directly.. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday. .

        "content": "She and her family asked the BBC not to reveal her precise location; their worry is that there may be repercussions even thousands of miles away from Iran.. Women in Iran are required to wear headscarves in public, even when abroad. But a few are choosing not to, in support of the women and girls spearheading the protests inside the country, following the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September. One of them, the climber Elnaz Rekabi, was forced to recant and it is unclear what her situation is, now that she is back in Iran.. Sara Khadem said there was a slow evolution of her decision to play in the tournament in Kazakhstan in December last year without her headscarf. The contestants only wore them in front of the cameras, and she felt that was hypocritical. Given the sacrifices being made by the women and girls on the streets of Iran, some of them risking their lives, it was the least she could do, she said. . Had she considered joining the demonstrators herself? \"Yes of course,\" she replied. But her young son, Sam, held her back. She said: \"I have responsibilities to him, and I thought perhaps I could use my influence in other ways.\" . Sara Khadem has been playing chess competitively since she was about eight years old. This is not the first time she has fallen foul of the Islamic Republic's strict codes of behaviour.. In 2020, a Ukrainian plane which took off from Tehran airport was shot down by, as it turned out, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, killing 176 people. It was three days before the authorities admitted their error. Ms Khadem said on social media she was planning to leave the national team. She did not mention the flight - nevertheless, she was forced to sign a confession saying she did not mean anything political by her post.. The next time she went to the airport, her passport was confiscated. She thought her career was over.. Now that her life has changed utterly, does she have any regrets? Without hesitation she said no. \"I miss my family, but I would not say I regret the decision. I still represent Iran, and I am Iranian, and the people of Iran still see me as Iranian.\". It struck me that she does not regard herself as political, though she acknowledges that so much in Iran is political. She said, \"I'm not an activist, and I don't have any messages for people risking so much. The people who are protesting in the streets are inspiring to me and so many others.\". Her husband, Ardeshir Ahmadi, is a film director and internet show presenter, who has also had direct experience of being on the wrong side of the Islamic Republic. A documentary film about hip hop resulted in him being beaten and imprisoned for three months. The decision which led to their exile was a joint one. . She has been able to stay in Spain because of the golden visa rule, which allows anyone who buys a property valued at half a million euros (£442,000; $536,000) to gain residency. . Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez invited Sara Khadem to meet him. The day turned out to be bittersweet. . \"It was on that day that I was issued with arrest orders at home. So I had mixed feelings: I was appreciated in this country - and in my own country, where you have achieved lots of success, you get arrest papers.\" . ",

        "content": "He then kicks Mr Amro before another soldier pushes him away.. Israel's national security minister has given his full support to the soldier.. \"I never had a source assaulted in front of me until today when an Israeli soldier who stopped my interview did this,\" wrote Mr Lawrence, whose post has had more than 7.5 million views.. The journalist is also a best-selling author, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11.. The account which the Israeli military gives of events differs from that of Mr Wright.. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that the soldier was guarding a military post in Hebron and asked a Palestinian who approached it to step away.. \"In response, the Palestinian began recording and cursing the soldier. A verbal confrontation followed, which soon became a physical confrontation, during which the soldier hit the Palestinian,\" the IDF stated..  leading to the assault. . \"The soldier initiated the encounter. Amro did not curse or interfere only asked that he call the commander.\". \"Before the assault the other soldiers were afraid to intervene although I warned them it was getting out of hand,\" he went on.. Several other video clips shared on social media show parts of the encounter.  . On his Twitter account, Mr Amro said: \"I didn't touch the soldier, my hands were behind my back not to give any excuse.\". The IDF has not commented on the inconsistencies.  . Its international spokesman, Lt Col Richard Hecht said: \"The soldier did not act as expected and did not follow the IDF code of conduct. The IDF will not hesitate, despite provocations, to preserve its ethics and morals.\". The IDF said that after an initial inquiry, the soldier was jailed in a military prison and would be suspended from active combat duty. It added that his service in his current unit would be examined.. , Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right firebrand who lives in a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron, called the sentence \"a disgrace\".. \"I fully back the soldier who didn't stay silent. Soldiers need to be given support, not jail time,\" he said.. He described Mr Amro as an \"anarchist who frequently pesters IDF soldiers in Hebron\".. Tensions often run high in Hebron making it a flashpoint for violence. It is the only Palestinian city in the West Bank which has Jewish settlers living in the heart of the Old City, part of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians since 1997.. Hebron is divided into two areas called H1 and H2. Some 200,000 Palestinians live in H1, which is under full control of the Palestinian Authority (PA).  . However, Israel has security control over H2, where several hundred hardline Jewish settlers and more than 30,000 Palestinians live. The PA is only responsible for civilian matters for Palestinian residents who face tight restrictions on their movements with a series of permanent checkpoints in the area operated by Israeli forces.   . Hebron contains a contested religious site called the Tomb of the Patriarchs - or Ibrahimi Mosque - which is revered by Jews, Muslims and Christians as the burial place of Abraham (Ibrahim in Arabic), Isaac and Jacob. It is the second holiest site in Judaism and the fourth in Islam.. Mr Amro is well known in Hebron as an anti-occupation activist. He is a fluent English speaker, who often gives tours of H2 for Israeli and international journalists and NGOs.. He has been arrested by the PA too - for his social media posts allegedly criticising the authority - and repeatedly by Israel.. Late last year, an Israeli military court ruled to remove Mr Amro from his home in Hebron for a week after . On the same day, another Israeli soldier pushed an activist to the ground and punched him in the face.  . The two soldiers received short sentences in military detention with Mr Ben Gvir also defending the soldier who made taunting remarks.. ",
