        "content": "Beijing's military budget - around $225bn (£186bn) - is still dwarfed by that of the United States, which is four times greater. . But analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence. . Outgoing Premier Li Keqiang told the NPC that \"external attempts to suppress and contain China are escalating\".. \"The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board,\" he said. . It was also announced at the meeting that China would pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year.. The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.. But this year's sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions.. This week's NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi's leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.. He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, . The increase in military spending comes as Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.. US officials have also repeatedly warned that China may invade Taiwan in the coming years. China has held ever-growing displays of military force in the air and seas around Taiwan, . China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. . The NPC will also unveil the new premier, China's equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.. Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi's most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. . ",

        "content": "Video shows fire engulfing part of the camp, destroying shelters made from bamboo and tarpaulin. The blaze, which is now under control, engulfed some 2,000 shelters at Cox's Bazar camp on Sunday.. It is estimated that about 12,000 people, most of whom escaped violence in neighbouring Myanmar, have had their accommodation destroyed.. The cause of the fire is not yet clear and no casualties have been reported.. The blaze started at about 14:45 local time (08: 45 GMT) and quickly tore through the bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters, an official said.. \"Some 2,000 shelters have been burnt, leaving about 12,000 forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals shelterless,\" Mijanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee commissioner, told AFP news agency.. The blaze was brought under control within three hours but at least 35 mosques and 21 learning centres for the refugees were also destroyed, he added.. Hrusikesh Harichandan, from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the BBC there had been \"massive damage\" to the camp.. He said basic services such as water centres and testing facilities had also been affected.. \"My shelter was gutted. [My shop] was also burnt,\" Mamun Johar, a 30-year-old Rohingya man, told AFP.. \"The fire took everything from me, everything.\". Thick black clouds were seen rising above Camp 11, one of many in the border district where more than a million Rohingya refugees live. . The camps, overcrowded and squalid, are vulnerable to fires.. Between January 2021 and December 2022, there were 222 fire incidents in the Rohingya camps including 60 cases of arson, according to a Bangladesh defence ministry report released last month.. In March 2021, .  after a huge fire tore through a camp in the settlement.. The refugee camp, said to be the world's largest, houses people who fled from Myanmar following a military crackdown against the Rohingya ethnic minority.. The Rohingya are Muslims in largely Buddhist Myanmar, where they have faced persecution for generations.. The latest exodus of Rohingya escaping to Bangladesh began in August 2017, after Myanmar's military brutally retaliated when a Rohingya insurgent group launched attacks on several police posts.. ",

        "content": "Current and former employees of the company tell BBC Panorama that features intended to protect Twitter users from trolling and harassment are proving difficult to maintain, amid what they describe as a chaotic working environment in which Mr Musk is shadowed by bodyguards at all times. I've spoken to dozens, with several going on the record for the first time.. The former head of content design says everyone on her team - which created safety measures such as nudge buttons - has been sacked. She later resigned. Internal research by Twitter suggests those safety measures reduced trolling by 60%. An engineer working for Twitter told me \"nobody's taking care\" of this type of work now, likening the platform to a building that seems fine from the outside, but inside is \"on fire\".. Twitter has not replied to the BBC's request for comment. . My investigation also reveals:  . Abuse on Twitter is nothing new for me - I'm a reporter who shares my coverage of disinformation, conspiracies and hate there. But throughout most of last year I noticed it steadily lessening across all of the social media sites. And then in November I realised it had got worse on Twitter again. . It turns out, I was right. A team from the International Center for Journalists and the University of Sheffield have been tracking the hate I receive, and their data revealed the abuse targeted at me on Twitter had more than tripled since Mr Musk took over, compared with the same period in the year before.. All of the social media sites have been under pressure to tackle online hate and harmful content - but they say they're taking measures to deal with it. Measures that no longer seem to be top of the agenda at Twitter. . In San Francisco, the home of Twitter's headquarters, I set out to look for answers. What better place to get them than from an engineer - responsible for the computer code that makes Twitter work. Because he's still working there, he's asked us to conceal his identity, so we're calling him Sam. . \"For someone on the inside, it's like a building where all the pieces are on fire,\" he revealed.. \"When you look at it from the outside the façade looks fine, but I can see that nothing is working. All the plumbing is broken, all the faucets, everything.\". He says the chaos has been created by the huge disruption in staffing. At least half of Twitter's workforce have been sacked or chosen to leave since Musk bought it. Now people from other teams are having to shift their focus, he says. . \"A totally new person, without the expertise, is doing what used to be done by more than 20 people,\" says Sam. \"That leaves room for much more risk, many more possibilities of things that can go wrong.\". He says previous features still exist but those who designed and maintained them have left - he thinks they are now left unmanned. . \"There are so many things broken and there's nobody taking care of it, that you see this inconsistent behaviour,\" he tells me. . The level of disarray, in his view, is because Mr Musk doesn't trust Twitter employees. He describes him bringing in engineers from his other company - electric car manufacturer Tesla - and asking them to evaluate engineers' code over just a few days before deciding who to sack. Code like that would take \"months\" to understand, he tells me. . He believes this lack of trust is betrayed by the level of security Mr Musk surrounds himself with. . \"Wherever he goes in the office, there are at least two bodyguards - very bulky, tall, Hollywood movie-[style] bodyguards. Even when [he goes] to the restroom,\" he tells me. . He thinks for Mr Musk it's about money. He says cleaning and catering staff were all sacked - and that Mr Musk even tried to sell the office plants to employees. . Lisa Jennings Young, Twitter's former head of content design, was one of the people who specialised in introducing features designed to protect users from hate. Twitter was a hotbed for trolling long before Mr Musk took over, but she says her team had made good headway at limiting this. Internal Twitter research, seen by the BBC, appears to back this up. . \"It was not at all perfect. But we were trying, and we were making things better all the time,\" she says. It is the first time she's publicly spoken of her experience since she left after Mr Musk's takeover. . Ms Jennings Young's team worked on several new features including safety mode, which can automatically block abusive accounts. They also designed labels applied to misleading tweets, and something called the \"harmful reply nudge\". The \"nudge\" alerts users before they send a tweet in which AI technology has detected trigger words or harmful language.  . Twitter's own research, seen by the BBC, appears to show the \"nudge\" and other safety tools being effective. . \"Overall 60% of users deleted or edited their reply when given a chance through the nudge,\" she says. \"But what was more interesting, is that after we nudged people once, they composed 11% fewer harmful replies in the future.\". These safety features were being implemented around the time my abuse on Twitter seemed to reduce, according to data collated by the University of Sheffield and International Center for Journalists. It's impossible to directly correlate the two, but given what the evidence tells us about the efficacy of these measures, it's possible to draw a link. . But after Mr Musk took over the social media company in late October 2022, Lisa's entire team was laid off, and she herself chose to leave in late November. I asked Ms Jennings Young what happened to features like the harmful reply nudge.. \"There's no-one there to work on that at this time,\" she told me. She has no idea what has happened to the projects she was doing.. So we tried an experiment. . She suggested a tweet that she would have expected to trigger a nudge. \"Twitter employees are lazy losers, jump off the Golden Gate bridge and die.\" I shared it on a private profile in response to one of her tweets, but to Ms Jennings Young's surprise, no nudge was sent. Another tweet with offensive language we shared was picked up - but Lisa says the nudge should have picked up a message wishing death on a user, not just swear words. As Sam had predicted, it didn't seem to be working as it was designed to. . During this investigation, I've had messages from many people who've told me how the hate they receive on Twitter has been increasing since Mr Musk took over - sharing examples of racism, antisemitism and misogyny.. Ellie Wilson, who lives in Glasgow, was raped while at university and began posting about that experience on social media last summer. At the time, she received a supportive response on Twitter. . But when she tweeted about her attacker in January after he was sentenced, she was subject to a wave of hateful messages. She received abusive and misogynistic replies - with some even telling her she deserved to be raped. . \"[What] I find most difficult [is] the people that say that I wasn't raped or that this didn't happen and that I'm lying. It's sort of like a secondary trauma,\" Ms Wilson told me.. Her Twitter following was smaller before the takeover, but when I looked into accounts targeting her with hate this time around, I noticed the trolls' profiles had become more active since the takeover, suggesting they'd been suspended previously and recently reinstated. . Some of the accounts had even been set up around the time of Mr Musk's takeover. They appeared to be dedicated to sending out hate, without profile pictures or identifying features. Several follow and interact with content from popular accounts that have been accused of promoting misogyny and hate - reinstated on Twitter after Musk decided to restore thousands of suspended accounts, including that of controversial influencer . .. \"By allowing those people a platform, you're empowering them. And you're saying, 'This is OK, you can do that.'\" . Several of the accounts also targeted other rape survivors she's in contact with. . Andrew Tate did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.. New research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue - a UK think tank that investigates disinformation and hate - echoes what I've uncovered about the troll accounts targeting Ellie. . It shows that tens of thousands of new accounts have been created since Mr Musk took over, which then immediately followed known abusive and misogynistic profiles - 69% higher than before he was in charge.  . The research suggests these abusive networks are now growing - and that Mr Musk's takeover has created a \"permissive environment\" for the creation and use of these kinds of accounts. . Mr Musk's key priorities since the takeover - according to his tweets - are to make the social media company profitable and to champion freedom of expression. . In December 2022, he released internal documents called the \"Twitter Files\" to explain why he believed the company hadn't been fairly applying its moderation and suspension policies under the old leadership.. But those who have been on the inside, feel like Mr Musk has used this to de-prioritise protecting users from harm altogether. Even the dangerous content he's lobbied against, including Child Sexual Abuse and networks of so-called bot accounts deliberately designed to mislead, isn't being tackled as it was before, they say. . It is not just individual trolls that Twitter has previously tried to guard against, but also so-called \"influence operations\" - state-sanctioned campaigns seeking to undermine democracy and target dissidents and journalists. . Ray Serrato worked in a team that specialised in tackling these operations. He left in November because he felt there wasn't a clear vision to protect users under the new leadership. He says his team would identify suspicious activity like this \"daily\". Now his team has been \"decimated\" and exists in a \"minimised capacity\".  . \"Twitter might have been the refuge where journalists would go out and have their voice be heard and be critical of the government. But I'm not sure that's going to be the case anymore.\" . \"There are a number of key experts that are no longer in that team that would have covered special regions, or threat actors, from Russia to China,\" he tells me. . Another insider, who we're calling Rory, is also very concerned about that drain of expertise - and how it appears to be undermining a Musk priority, preventing paedophiles using Twitter to groom victims and share links to abuse. Rory was employed until very recently as part of a team tackling child sexual exploitation [CSE]. . His team would identify accounts sharing abusive content about children, escalating the worst to law enforcement. Before the takeover such content was a huge problem, he says - and he already feared they were understaffed. . \"Every day you would be able to identify that sort of material,\" he says. . But his team was cut soon after the acquisition, he says, from 20 people to around six or seven. In his view that's too few to keep on top of the workload. . Rory says - before he left - neither Mr Musk nor any other member of the new management made contact with him and his old team, who between them had years of experience in this area. . \"You can't take over a company and suddenly believe you have knowledge… to deal with [Child Sexual Exploitation] without having the experts in place,\" he says. . Twitter says it removed 400,000 accounts in one month alone to help \"make Twitter safer\". But Rory is worried there are now fewer people with the knowledge to effectively escalate concerns about this content with law enforcement.. \"You can by all means suspend hundreds of thousands of accounts in a month. But if the reporting of that content [to law enforcement] has dropped, then it doesn't really mean anything, and most of the users who had their accounts suspended would just set up a new account anyway.\"  . He adds that offending users can then just set up new accounts, at a time when suspended profiles are being welcomed back to Twitter.. I wanted to ask Elon Musk about the takeover, his vision for Twitter and how he thinks it is playing out in reality. I tried to contact him via email, tweets and even a Twitter \"poll\". This wasn't a real poll but Mr Musk has used these votes to make decisions about Twitter's future, and I was hoping it might catch his attention. More than 40,000 users voted and 89% said Mr Musk should do an interview with me. I had no response. . Twitter and Mr Musk are yet to respond to the points raised in the BBC Panorama investigation. I'm told all of Twitter's communications team have either resigned or been sacked. Twitter's policies, available online, say that \"defending and respecting the user's voice\" remains one of its \"core values\".. ",

        "content": "The agreement was reached on Saturday evening, after 38 hours of talks, at UN headquarters in New York.. The negotiations had been held up for years over disagreements on funding and fishing rights.. The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 - the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.. That agreement established an area called the high seas - international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research - but only 1.2% of these waters are protected. . Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.. In the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, . These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. . Environmental groups .  that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.. The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".. Rena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.. Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.. Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. . Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. . Dr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.. He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that's our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\". Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\".. \"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.. Countries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. . Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\". ",
