        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. At least 62 migrants are confirmed to have died, with 12 children said to be among the victims, including a baby.. The vessel, thought to have carried some 200 people, broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. . People from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran were said to be on board.. Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region. . The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remain unaccounted for.. One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Many of those on board were thought to be from Pakistan. Its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said more than two dozen Pakistanis were believed to have been among those who drowned, and has asked diplomats to verify the facts as soon as possible. . As assistance and relocation operations continue, a group of survivors of the deadly shipwreck are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones. . At a temporary reception centre in the town of Isola di Capo Rizzuto, some of them were crying without speaking, some were just staring into the void, wrapped in blankets. . \"They are heavily traumatised\" said Sergio Di Dato, from charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). \"Some children have lost their whole family. We are offering them all the support we can.\". A 16-year-old boy from Afghanistan lost his 28-year-old sister, who died on the beach next to him. He can't find the strength to tell his parents. . A 43-year-old man from Afghanistan survived with his 14-year-old son, but his wife and his three other children, who were 13, nine, and five did not make it. Another Afghan woman in tears would not move from the beach after losing her husband..  \"This is yet another tragedy happening near our shores. It reminds us all that the Mediterranean is a giant mass grave, with tens of thousands of souls in it, and it continues to widen,\" said Francesco Creazzo, spokesman for SOS Méditerranée, an NGO engaged in rescue operations in the central Mediterranean. . \"There is no end in sight; in 2013, people said 'never again' to the little white coffins of Lampedusa, in 2015, they said 'never again' in front of the lifeless body of a two-year-old Syrian child on a beach. Now the words 'never again' are not even pronounced any more. We only hear 'no more departures', but unfortunately people keep venturing on this journey and they keep dying,\"  he added. . Speaking at the UN's Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday morning, Secretary General António Guterres called on countries to do more to help refugees and migrants, and for safer travel routes and strengthened rescue operations. . \"Just yesterday [Sunday], yet another horrific shipwreck in the Mediterranean claimed the lives of scores of people seeking a better future for themselves and their children. Refugee and migrant rights are human rights,\" he said.. He added that while criminal gangs controlled migration routes, people would continue to die: \"We need safe, orderly, legal routes for migrants and refugees. And we must do everything possible to prevent the loss of life by providing search and rescue and medical care.\". Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - on Sunday expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement.. \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. The vessel, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. ",

        "content": "Dozens of cars and houses were also burnt, according to a local official.. It followed the killings of the two Israelis - brothers from a nearby settlement - along a highway.. The Israeli military said it was continuing to search for the Palestinian who shot Hillel Yaniv, 22, and Yagel Yaniv, 20, and that it had moved in extra troops. . Earlier on Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a summit in Jordan.. Videos posted hours after the summit ended showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.  . A Palestinian official who monitors settlements in the Nablus region, Ghassan Daghlas, told Palestinian Wafa news agency that 30 houses were damaged by stones or burned down, and that 15 vehicles were torched. . Settlers also set a barn and three vehicles on fire in nearby Burin, as well as a house and a water tank in Asira al-Qabaliyya, he said.. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara.. This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\".. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis.. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don't take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement.. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on the brothers, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles (2km) south of Nablus.. The two men were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times. . No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions' Den.. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in Nablus last Wednesday in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005. . Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians.. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. ",
