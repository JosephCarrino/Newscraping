        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spokeswoman. Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\", said US Northern Command.. The FBI is examining the items, which the US says were used to spy on sensitive military sites. . The US has shot down three more objects since the first one on 4 February.. \"Large sections of the structure\" were also recovered on Monday off the coast of South Carolina, military officials say.. About 30-40ft (9-12m) of the balloon's antenna array are among the items found, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.. US officials said the high-altitude balloon originated in China and was used for surveillance, but China said it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown astray.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border.. In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-22 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources. The second missile hit the target, according to reports.. Each Sidewinder missile costs over $400,000 (£330,000).. Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the original balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target. . White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down \"out of an abundance of caution\".. They did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\", he said.. The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses. . The second object, over Alaska, was described by officials as the size of a \"small car\". The third object, over the Yukon, was \"cylindrical\". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be \"octagonal\" with strings attached. . This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. The recovery of the balloon shot down on 4 February was delayed amid foul weather.  . Efforts are under way to collect debris from where the other objects were blown out of the sky.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles), including \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sean McGillis said there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote locations. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost said all three of the most recent objects to be shot down appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discovered debris should contact the police directly.. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday. . Amid the row over high-altitude aircrafts, America's top diplomat cancelled a visit to Beijing that was initially planned for last week.. ",

        "content": "with a simple message: \"I'd love for him to get some sales.\" . The book jumped to No. 1 on Amazon's Serial Killer Thrillers list. . Her dad's response was: \"I'm ready for a nap.\". The viral video, which details Mr Richards' long journey to finishing the novel, Stone Maidens, has garnered more than 40 million views.. TikTok, a short-form video hosting platform, has helped fuel sales of hundreds of books in recent years, including through the hashtag #BookTok, which readers use to discuss their favourite authors and book picks. In 2021 alone, BookTok helped authors sell 20 million printed books, according to a New York Times report.. The news of his overnight fame has overwhelmed Mr Richards, who cried while reading the comments section of the TikTok post after his daughter told him it went viral.. His daughter cried, too, thanking fans for the purchases. \"Because of them, you're number one,\" she told her dad. . \"He doesn't even know what TikTok is,\" she added. . Mr Richards' daughter said her dad - who lives with his wife in Montpelier, Vermont - was content simply to have finished the novel, which was published in 2012, and tells the story of an FBI forensic anthropologist investigating a serial killer who strangles women and dumps their bodies in the ravines of southern Indiana. . The book may have been inspired by Mr Richards' previous work. He garnered true crime expertise while serving as a senior law clerk for an Indiana judge researching and writing drafts for published opinions, including one on the appeal of a serial killer sentenced to death, according to his Amazon biography. . Fans on TikTok were quick to praise the book, as well as its author's story. . \"I've never ordered something so fast in my life,\" one user said after seeing the heart-warming video. . After \"25 years of little hope\", Mr Richards' unexpected success should serve as a reminder to never give up, his daughter said in a later TikTok video. . \"These last couple of days... I can't understand it,\" Mr Richards said in the video, toasting the boost in sales with milkshakes. \"I feel so blessed.\". But Mr Richards is not taking too long a break to celebrate. He is now working on a sequel to the book, according to his Amazon biography. . ",

        "content": "And in a post on his Telegram channel, Mr Prigozhin calls the soldier, Dmitry Yakushchenko, \"a fine fellow\".. Wagner may have faked the earlier video. It appeared to show Yakushchenko being hit fatally with a sledgehammer.. Mr Prigozhin joked about that video in reply to an inquiry from Russian news outlet Ostorozhno Media about Yakushchenko's true fate.. \"Ksenia, don't treat everything so gloomily. The kids are having fun,\" the Wagner chief wrote enigmatically. . He said the case was not a one-off drama, but more like the hit Soviet-era TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, a thriller set in World War Two. \"You know, good always triumphs over evil,\" he added.. Yakushchenko's current circumstances are unclear - and there is no confirmation that he is still alive, despite Mr Prigozhin's message on Telegram. Yakushchenko may have returned to Wagner via a prisoner exchange, but that has not been confirmed. . In the first video on Monday, released on the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone, he admitted having fled to the Ukrainian side, before being kidnapped and ending up as a prisoner of Wagner.. The apparent sledgehammer \"execution\", filmed in a cellar, was presented as the \"trial of a traitor\". . It was similar to a brutal killing shown in a . , again involving a soldier accused of defecting to the Ukrainians.. Wagner calls itself a \"private military company\" (PMC) and has thousands of troops involved in heavy fighting in Ukraine.. It began operations in 2014 in Crimea and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of . In the second video on Monday, Yakushchenko said: \"In Wagner PMC, everyone has the right to correct their mistakes. . \"When I was captured, I said all sorts of garbage and I'm still ashamed, but it was the only way to survive. Upon return from captivity, I brought lots of valuable information that saved the lives of many guys, so I was forgiven, for which I am very grateful.\". Neither video indicated where or when the filming took place, nor was that clear from the accompanying text posts.. Grey Zone named the alleged \"traitor\" as Crimea-born Dmitry Yakushchenko, 44, who defected to Ukraine four days after becoming a Wagner fighter.. The first part of the video showed him in Ukrainian captivity - the BBC has established that the clip came from Ukrainian channel Espreso.TV. . In it, Yakushchenko suggested that Crimea might return to Ukraine's control in a couple of years.. According to the text, he had been jailed earlier for murder, but had seized the chance to fight for Wagner in order to leave jail. Wagner is known to have . The video then cuts to a shot of Yakushchenko sitting in a cellar with his head taped to construction debris set against a stone wall. . Another man is standing behind him holding a sledgehammer. A caption calls the scene \"trial for treachery\".. At the point where the first hammer blow is struck, the video goes blurred and Yakushchenko falls backwards. Further blows are struck, then a caption reads \"the court session is adjourned\".. The Grey Zone post makes a sarcastic comment about Yakushchenko's apparent death, referring back to Wagner's November \"execution\" of Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was also a former prison inmate. . \"Like his colleague Yevgeny Nuzhin earlier, he caught the same disease that makes you lose consciousness in Ukrainian cities, earlier in Kyiv, now in Dnipro, and then wake up in a basement at your last court session,\" the post said.. The shadowy mercenary group has adopted a more public profile since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago - even opening a big headquarters in St Petersburg. . Yevgeny Prigozhin, for years a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been nicknamed \"Putin's chef\" for providing catering services for the Russian elite and armed forces. . But he has given Wagner credit for the offensive on Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, .  and suggesting that his forces are more competent fighters.. ",

Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain.. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. . Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. . Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use \"saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages\".. The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.. She urged Moldova's parliament to adopt laws to give the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors \"the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats\". She added that \"the Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will fail\".. This video can not be played. Maia Sandu: \"We have the right to choose what we want for our country\" (2020 interview). Moldova's main Socialist and Communist opposition bloc has strong links with Moscow. President Sandu's predecessor Igor Dodon - who ruled from 2016 to 2020 - pursued close ties with Russia.. But since the USSR's collapse in 1991, Moldova has forged a deeper partnership with Romania, an EU member.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, former Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\"..
