        "content": "\"We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,\" . Malawi was \"overwhelmed\" he added. . Relentless rain and strong winds have hampered overstretched emergency teams in the country's southern and central regions, which are worst affected, Mr Kalaya said. . Victims taken to a hospital in Blantyre had injuries caused by falling trees, landslides and flash floods, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters news agency.. \"A lot of [homes] are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads,\" she is quoted as saying. . Casualties were still arriving from affected areas, said Chipiliro Khamula, spokesperson for Malawi's department of disaster management. Officials expect the death toll to rise as some areas remain cut off.. Freddy is the strongest tropical cyclone on record and could also be the long-lasting one, according to the World Meteorological Organization. . On Sunday the storm struck Mozambique as a cyclone - for the second time in a less than a month after battering the island nation of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, causing severe destruction.. It has been difficult to determine the extent of the damage caused in Mozambique and the number of deaths as power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected areas. . The timing of the storm could exacerbate Malawi's cholera outbreak, the UN and other agencies have warned, as the country battles one of its worst public heath crises. . Experts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.. Freddy had broke records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean from north-western Australia.. ",

        "content": "But the $8bn (£6.6bn) proposal faced a torrent of online activism in recent weeks, particularly among youth activists on TikTok.. Opponents argued it should be halted over its climate and wildlife impacts.. Located on Alaska's remote North Slope, it is the largest oil development in the region for decades and could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.. According to US Bureau of Land Management estimates, that means it will generate up to 278 million metric tonnes of CO2e over its 30-year lifetime - the equivalent of adding two million cars to US roads every year.. CO2e is a unit used to express the climate impact of all greenhouse gases together, as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide.. Monday's approval comes one day after the Biden administration imposed limits on oil and gas drilling in 16 million acres of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean, a compromise of sorts with anti-Willow activists.. Environmentalists had argued Willow is inconsistent with President Biden's pledges to lead on climate action.. More than one million letters of protest were written to the White House, and a Change.org petition calling for Willow to be halted drew more than three million signatures.. \"It's the wrong move and will be a disaster for wildlife, lands, communities, and our climate,\" environmental charity Sierra Club said on Monday.. Sonny Ahk, a young Iñuipat activist from Alaska who campaigned against Willow, said the development would \"lock in Arctic oil and gas extraction for another 30 years and catalyse future oil expansion in the Arctic\".. \"While out-of-state executives take in record profits, local residents are left to contend with the detrimental impacts of being surrounded by massive drilling operations,\" he said. . But all three lawmakers who represent Alaska in Congress, including one Democrat, pushed for the project's approval, touting it as a much-needed investment in the region's communities.. They also argued it would help boost domestic energy production and lessen the country's reliance on foreign oil.. \"This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,\" added ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance on Monday.. The US energy giant, which is already Alaska's largest crude oil producer, will enhance energy security, create good union jobs and provide benefits to Alaska Native communities, he said.. So why has a president who has embraced strong action on climate change just approved a project dubbed a \"carbon bomb\"?. It's because Willow is all about politics and the law - and not the environment. . While running as a candidate back in 2020, Joe Biden promised that there would be \"no more drilling on federal lands, period\". That promise was broken last year when the administration announced plans to sell drilling leases, under pressure from the courts. . The White House will likely say that the role of the courts has also influenced the Willow decision.. Oil company ConocoPhillips have held the lease since 1999 and would have had a strong case to appeal if their plans had been turned down. . The Biden administration is obviously aware that, from a purely climate perspective, the project can't really be justified. So, as a sop to opponents, they've tried to balance the approval with new bans on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean. . Most environmentalists aren't buying that trade off.. Willow is also deeply political.. With a presidential election in 18 months, Mr Biden is keen to be seen as a centrist, concerned about gas supply and prices for US citizens.. But, in giving the green light to drilling, he now risks the support of many young people who voted for him in large numbers in 2020. . This video can not be played.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. A draft law introduced in the Russian parliament on Monday aims to push back the age bracket for compulsory military service, from the current 18-27 years to 21-30. . Reuters reported that, due to the transition period between the old legislation and the new, 2024 and 2025 would see the conscription age span 10 or 11 years rather than the usual nine - meaning more men would be eligible to fight. . Russia's previous attempt to draft thousands of new recruits into the Ukraine war met with some resistance. In September the announcement of a partial military mobilisation saw .  as men of draft age sought to flee the call-up. . The Kremlin said reports of fighting-age men fleeing had been exaggerated.. Besides the Bakhmut fighting, seven residents were injured elsewhere in Donetsk region on Monday, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line. He added that Russia was bringing more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. ",
