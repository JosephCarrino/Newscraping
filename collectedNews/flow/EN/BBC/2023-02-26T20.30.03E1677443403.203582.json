        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. The vessel reportedly broke apart while trying to land with about 150 people aboard near the coastal town of Crotone in the Calabria region.. Many bodies have been recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort. . Large numbers of people fleeing conflict and poverty make the crossing from Africa to Italy each year.. Local officials put the confirmed death toll in the latest tragedy to strike the central Mediterranean at either 58 or 59. . Earlier the coastguard said 80 people had been recovered alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . Manuela Curra, a local government official, told Reuters news agency that the boat had left the Turkish coastal city of Izmir three or four days ago.. Those onboard were mainly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran, according to Italian officials, and President Sergio Mattarella said many were fleeing \"very difficult conditions\". . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said. . The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that has been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, has told Rai News. . Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" for the incident, blaming the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

        "content": "Moscow said \"anti-Russian\" Western countries had \"destabilised\" the G20.. It comes after China this week published a plan to end the conflict that was viewed by some as pro-Russian. . India, which hosted this week's G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging \"chair's summary\" from the meeting, noting there were \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.. A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were \"agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China\". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration in November, and criticised \"in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine\".. After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, . China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia's invasion.. The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: \"[President] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?\". After the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because \"their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues\". . \"On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy\" and needed to be mentioned, he added. . The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.. Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that \"the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way\". . It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of \"clear blackmail\", urging them to \"acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world\". . But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: \"This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting.\" . Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. . On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York . . The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.. ",

        "content": "Further results will not be formally announced until 10:00 GMT on Monday.. Following widespread delays and attacks on some polling stations on Saturday, voting was postponed until Sunday in parts of the country.. Voting continued through the night in some areas.. Turnout appears to be high, especially among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters.. This makes it the biggest democratic exercise in Africa.. The election has seen an unprecedented challenge to the two-party system that has dominated Nigeria for 24 years.. Peter Obi from the previously little known Labour Party, Mr Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are all seen as potential winners. There are 15 other presidential candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. Saturday's voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, as well as scattered reports of ballot-box snatching and attacks by armed men, especially in southern areas, where Mr Obi has strong backing. . Dr Nkem Okoli was just about to vote in the Lekki district of the biggest city Lagos when masked men attacked the polling station.. \"There was pandemonium. There were bottles flying everywhere,\" she told the BBC. \"They broke [the ballot box]. They stole the phones of the officials. Now we can't vote.\". In some areas, voting did not begin until around 18:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after polls were due to close.. First-time voter Susan Ekpoh told the BBC that she spent 13 hours at her polling station in the capital, Abuja, only leaving at midnight.. She said when it got dark, election officials said they needed light to see what they were doing, so she and others . The southern Bayelsa state was among those areas where voting was delayed until Sunday - it is not clear how many parts of the country saw voting postponed.. Harrison Rosaline said she waited for five hours to vote on Saturday in Bayelsa's capital, Yenagoa, without seeing any election officials. But she returned, with her two-week old baby, and is delighted to have finally cast her ballot.. \"I was motivated because I want a better Nigeria. I want this country to be good for everybody, including my baby,\" she told the BBC.. There is tension in parts of Rivers and Lagos states, where some political parties have asked their members to go to the centres where votes are being collated, to prevent them being manipulated.. There have also been complaints over the use of the recently introduced electronic voting system, with many voters accusing electoral officials of refusing to upload the results at the polling units as they are supposed to.. However, in those areas where voting went smoothly, results are being posted outside individual polling stations.. This video can not be played. The mood at Nigeria's polls in 60 seconds. The results from tens of thousands of polling stations around the country are being added up. An official from the electoral body in each of Nigeria's 36 states will then travel to the capital, Abuja, where the results will be announced state-by-state.. Final results are not expected before Monday at the earliest, and possibly not until Wednesday.. At a press briefing on Saturday, electoral chief Mahmood Yakubu apologised for the delays in voting.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. Whoever wins will have to deal with a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives.. Mr Obi, 61, enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the largely Christian south.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted because one of the two traditional parties is more likely to win.. The PDP's Mr Abubakar, 76, is the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Mr Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Lagos during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies..
