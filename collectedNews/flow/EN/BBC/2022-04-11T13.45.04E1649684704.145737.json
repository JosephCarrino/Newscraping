        "content": "The Met Police said 38 arrests were made on Sunday and officers had now moved protesters from the bridges.. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas earlier told the BBC the group's protests could sometimes be counterproductive.. But for some people, the rallies were the only way they felt heard, she said. The government has yet to comment.. During the earlier protests, campaigners sat in the road, waving flags and placards.. They were told by police officers there was evidence they were causing \"serious disruption\" to the public, warning them to leave or face arrest.. The Met said it imposed conditions under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 to clear protesters from around Vauxhall Bridge and officers physically removed the last of the activists - with a number being taken away in police vans.. Doctors and nurses from a small group of medical workers who refused to leave Lambeth Bridge were among those arrested, Extinction Rebellion tweeted.. Earlier, one of the protesters - Kiri Ley, 21, a student from Birmingham - said the aim was to occupy the capital peacefully to try to force policy changes.. She said: \"We tried all the other methods - we've written letters, we've marched, we've spoken to our MPs, we've done literally everything we can and time and time again we see them doing completely the opposite of what the scientific evidence says and this is what is left to us, really, we do it because we know it works.\". Earlier, campaigners also spray painted red hands outside the London corporate offices of oilfield services company Schlumberger.. Ms Lucas said: \"I am sorry that it has come to this and that this is the only way that people feel they can make their voices heard.\". The activists have vowed to block areas of London \"for as long as possible\" every day for at least a week.. A protest in Oxford Circus on Saturday brought the West End to a standstill.. Ms Lucas said: \"Personally for example, if you are going to try and stop Tube trains moving around I think that is counterproductive.. \"I think that being on the streets of London has been shown to be a way of capturing people's imaginations.. \"People have joined those protests who have never protested before. They are doing it because they know we have to leave new fossil fuels in the ground.. \"The International Energy Agency says that, the latest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report says that, and yet this government and this energy strategy... is foreseeing getting out even more oil and gas from the North Sea, that is frankly immoral and the UN general secretary said that is frankly both morally and economically mad.\". The Met tweeted on Sunday evening: \"Both demonstrations within the Vauxhall Area have now concluded and the roads have reopened.. \"As a result of today's policing operation we have made 38 arrests.\" .

        "subtitle": "Nearly 2,500 barristers essential to the criminal justice system will start industrial action.",
        "content": "It stems from an unresolved row with the government over funding.. The government said the action would make existing backlogs worse.. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) has accused ministers of dragging their feet over implementing a 15% rise in rates for legal aid - as recommended by an independent review.. The CBA said 15% was the bare minimum needed to stop the system from collapsing.. Figures published last week revealed 10% of criminal barristers have quit in the past year, and that the government's measures to reduce a nationwide backlog are making slow progress.. The action, supported by about 90% of criminal barristers, will begin this morning.. The informal system at the heart of this action is the legal equivalent of coming off the subs bench in the 87th minute after another player has hobbled off. . If a barrister is stuck in a delayed case in one court, meaning they can't make their commitment in another, a colleague volunteers to read the case file - often overnight - and goes along as their substitute. . Once a judge knows both the prosecution and defence are properly represented in court, he or she can keep the case moving towards verdict. . If there's no barrister available, judges can only cancel the hearing until another day. . Within weeks, those adjournments will be competing for slots against both new cases, as well as the existing backlog. . Worst case scenario? Entire prosecutions will be put back for months as courts struggle to find a way to get them heard. . The government is pretty furious - but many criminal lawyers - particularly the young - say they are barely making a living and there's now too few of them left. The evidence for that? Some 280 trials were put off between October and December last year because of a shortage of prosecutors and defenders.. An independent review last year .  without an immediate injection of £135m into the legal aid system.. The review, launched after predictions the system could collapse, determined that ministers should find the funding to reverse a large loss of lawyers who are vital to the process. . The Ministry of Justice said it was increasing investment in criminal legal aid by £135m a year, and this included an increase in fees for criminal barristers resulting in a pay rise. . Justice minister James Cartlidge: \"The Crown Court backlog is now falling thanks to our decisive action and the hard work of legal professionals and as a result of our reforms the typical criminal barrister will earn nearly £7,000 extra per year.. \"This is a significant pay rise and I encourage the Criminal Bar Association to work with us, rather than pursue unnecessary disruption in the courts which will only serve to delay justice for victims.\". The legal aid system in England and Wales ensures that suspects who cannot afford lawyers are properly advised and represented, from their police interview through to trial.. The system is critical to keeping justice moving by saving court time and making sure defendants get a fair trial. . However, the amounts paid for this work have been both frozen and then cut over the past 25 years.. , former judge Sir Christopher Bellamy QC supported many of the concerns of lawyers - and urged ministers to find a minimum of £135m to stem an exodus of lawyers from criminal justice and to help tackle the current backlog of 59,000 cases in the Crown Court system.. \"£135m is, in my view, the minimum necessary as the first step in nursing the system of criminal legal aid back to health after years of neglect,\" he said.. \"I do not see that sum as 'an opening bid' but rather what is needed, as soon as practicable, to enable...  the whole criminal justice system to function effectively, to respond to forecast increased demand, and to reduce the backlog.\". \"There is in my view no scope for further delay.\".

        "content": "The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. . The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020.. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP). which measures activity in services, construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January.. \"The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. . \"But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon.\" . Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, a business lobby group, said: \"Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since, with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth,\" he said. \"Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict, which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption.\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he \"welcomed\" February's growth figures. He said: \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion.\". The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment \"driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars\".. It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. . Barret Kupelian, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: \"This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with, because of the semiconductor shortage. . \"Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases.\". The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was, in part, \"driven by Storm Eunice, Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed\".. The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued, with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators.    . Mr Kupelian said growth momentum \"shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic, including accommodation and food services, activities and arts, entertainment, and recreation\". . He said: \"We expect that there is still more growth to come from these sectors.\" . What did Putin do before he came to power?. Ellie Simmonds investigates a controversial new drug.

Supporters claim it will create jobs and reduce the need to import coal. . However, opponents say it will damage the UK's commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions.. The proposed mine would remove coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea for the production of steel in the UK and Europe.. Copeland mayor Mike Starkie, who has previously said local support for a new mine is strong, said the process had \"dragged on for over six years\".. He said: \"Now the planning inspector has completed his report which I hope - and expect - is a recommendation that the approval is granted immediately with no further unnecessary delay.. \"I would urge the secretary of state to approve the mine immediately - there is a clear demand for coking coal and approval will give a huge economic boost to west Cumbria.. \"It also supports both the government's levelling-up agenda and the need to become more self-reliant. There is no need to delay approval for this mine a minute longer.\". Governing is about difficult choices; confronting seemingly irreconcilable demands - and making a decision.  . So, should the government say yes to a new coal mine in Cumbria, providing a domestic source of coking coal for the steel industry?  . Around 40% of the UK's coking coal is currently imported from Russia.  . Or do promises to drive down carbon emissions make opening a new mine look ridiculous?  . There's been disagreement and dither. Plenty of both. But now, for the first time, the government faces a deadline, the 7th July. By then it has to decide what to do. . Planning inspector Stephen Normington previously said he would make his recommendation in late December or early January.. The mine was approved to operate until 2049 by Cumbria County Council in October 2020, but . .. West Cumbria Mining previously said exploratory works led it to estimate there were about 750m tonnes of \"excellent quality\" coking coal in the area..
