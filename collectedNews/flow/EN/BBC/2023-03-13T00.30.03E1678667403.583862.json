        "content": "It is the latest energy firm to report record profits, after energy prices spiked following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.. America's ExxonMobil made $55.7bn, and Britain's Shell reported $39.9bn.. Aramco also declared a dividend of $19.5bn for the October to December quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.. Most of that will go to the Saudi government, which owns nearly 95% of the shares in the company. . Brent crude oil, the benchmark oil price, now trades at around $82 a barrel - though prices .  after Russia's invasion, and June.. \"Aramco rode the wave of high energy prices in 2022,\" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"It would have been difficult for Aramco not to perform strongly in 2022.\". In a statement on Sunday, .  the company results were \"underpinned by stronger crude oil prices, higher volumes sold and improved margins for refined products\".. Aramco's president and CEO Amin Nasser said: \"Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real - including contributing to higher energy prices.\". To address those challenges, he said, the company would not only focus on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production - but also invest in new lower-carbon technologies.. Aramco - the world's second-most valuable company only behind America's Apple - is a major emitter of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.. Responding to Aramco's announcement, Amnesty International's secretary general . : \"It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161bn in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel - the single largest driver of the climate crisis.\". She added: \"It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\". Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).. The Gulf kingdom has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents, and for the widespread use of capital punishment.. In a separate development on Sunday, Iran said its oil exports had reached their highest level since the re-imposition of . Oil Minister Javad Owji said exports increased by 83 million barrels in 2022 compared with the previous 12 months. In Iran, a new year starts in March. . Analysts say the rise is due to greater shipments to Iranian allies China and Venezuela. . Tehran's export revenues took a significant hit after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal five years ago.. The US sanctions, coupled with economic mismanagement and corruption, have meant that the Iranian economy has not had any substantive .  And by some measures, it is still 4-8% smaller than it was back in 2010.. ",

        "content": "He was arrested in 2014 while crossing the border from Jordan into Saudi Arabia, accused of smuggling amphetamines.   . He was later sentenced to death, after a trial criticised by Amnesty International as \"grossly unfair\".  . His sister, Zeinab Abul Al-Khair, said he had told her from jail that he had been strung up by his feet and beaten.  . \"He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" she told me earlier this year.. His case has drawn international concern, with fears for his fate growing after Saudi Arabia last November ended an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty for drugs offences. Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed on such charges.. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had found that Mr Abu al-Khair's detention lacked legal basis.   . And in late 2022, the UN Human Rights office appealed for his release.  . It says the use of the death penalty for drug offences is incompatible with international norms and standards.. \"We urge the Saudi government to halt al-Kheir's reported imminent execution and to comply with the Working Group's opinion by quashing his death sentence, releasing him immediately and unconditionally, and by ensuring that he receives medical care, compensation and other reparations,\" said spokesperson Liz Throssell.. The announcement that Hussein Abu al-Khair had been put to death was made on the Saudi press agency and comes a year to the day since the biggest mass execution in modern Saudi history.. Campaign group Reprieve said the Saudi authorities had not warned his family that he was about to be executed - or given them the chance to say goodbye. . It has been highly critical of Saudi Arabia's allies, including the UK, for not taking a stronger stand against human rights abuses in the Kingdom. . \"Exactly a year ago, Mohammed bin Salman's regime executed 81 men in a single day, and Saudi Arabia's international partners shrugged and issued empty statements about the importance of human rights,\" said Reprieve's director, Maya Foa.  . \"Rather than condemn the Crown Prince, world leaders queued up to shake his bloodstained hands. Today's atrocity and others like it is the inevitable result. When partners signal that the Saudi regime can kill without consequences, you can be sure it will,\" she added. . Mr Abu al-Khair's case was raised in the UK parliament in late November - with a Foreign Office minister answering an Urgent Question about a surge of executions in Saudi Arabia by saying that the authorities had \"clearly\" tortured him and describing his treatment as \"abhorrent\".. The following week the minister, David Rutley, asked for his words to be struck from the parliamentary record, . Responding to news of the execution, Conservative MP David Davis said: \"The UK government knew Hussein Abu al-Khair was at imminent risk, but the foreign secretary failed to publicly call for his execution to be halted, despite his predecessors taking this kind of action in the past. . \"The UK must signal it will no longer turn a blind eye to executions like these, and speak out strongly on behalf of others who remain at risk, including child defendants like Abdullah al-Howaiti.\". The Saudi Press Agency said the Ministry of the Interior was announcing that the death penalty had been implemented against Hussein Abu al-Khair to \"confirm the keenness of the Kingdom's government to combat drugs of all kinds because of the severe harm they cause to the individual and society\"..

San Diego Lifeguard chief James Gartland called it one of the state's worst maritime smuggling tragedies.. Officials said they did not know the nationalities of the victims but they were all adults.. Emergency responders from several agencies found two overturned boats with bodies spread over an area of 400 yards (366m), and a search operation continued into Sunday morning. . It was unclear what caused the incident but Mr Gartland described the area as \"hazardous\" due to sand bars and in-shore rip currents.. Rescuers did not find any survivors, but some may have left the beach before the emergency services arrived, he suggested.. James Spitler, a sector commander for the San Diego Coast Guard, said one small boat which was carrying more passengers \"overturned in the surf,\" while the other managed to reach the shore.. He described the incident as a tragedy and said: \"This is not necessarily people trying to find a better life. This is part of a transnational criminal organisation effort to smuggle people into the United States. . \"These people are often labour trafficked and sex trafficked when they arrive.\". San Diego is close to the border between the US and Mexico and the US government has constructed a fence into the sea to the south of the city to deter migrants.. Eric Lavergne, a US Border Patrol official in San Diego, told Reuters this was one of a few hundred migrant smuggling events recorded in the area over the past five months - which is similar to the rate in recent years..
