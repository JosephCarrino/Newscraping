        "content": "Protests are expected across France, after more than a million people took part in the first day of action earlier this month.. Half of primary teachers are on strike.. The Macron government is pushing ahead with its pension age reforms in the face of opinion polls that suggest two-thirds of voters are opposed to the changes, which begin their passage through National Assembly next week.. Without a majority in parliament, the government will have to rely on the right-wing Republicans for support as much as the ruling parties' own MPs.. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon said France was at a crucial point and predicted an even greater number of protesters than on the first day of action on 19 January. Street protests are expected in all the major cities and in smaller towns too. A reported 11,000 police have been deployed to cover the demonstrations.. There was severe disruption to transport in the Paris area, with one in three high-speed trains running and only two driverless metro lines operating normally. Large crowds were reported on one of the main overground lines in the capital.. The CGT union said at least three-quarters of workers had walked out at the big TotalEnergies oil refineries and fuel depots.. One of the main teachers' unions said half of all nursery and primary school teachers would be on strike. High school pupils staged protests outside some schools and students said they would occupy Sciences Po university in Paris in support of the strikers.. \"A lot of French people feel that working is more and more painful. It's not that they don't want to work, they don't want to work in these conditions,\" Sciences Po political scientist Bruno Palier told the BBC.. The government has indicated it may move some way on the detail of the reform but has refused to give in on the main thrust of the raising the retirement age by two years to 64.. Economist Prof Philippe Aghion said the reforms were necessary because France had a structural deficit of some €13bn ($14bn; £11bn) and raising the retirement age would also help increase the rate of employment in France.. \"That will give the government credibility to make some investments that it needs to make in schooling, in the hospital system that it needs to improve, and more investment in innovation and green industrialisation,\" he told the BBC..

        "content": "Most were poached in Etosha, Namibia's biggest national park, officials say.. Rhino numbers in Africa have dropped significantly in recent decades to feed demand for rhino horn in China and Vietnam.. Poachers killed 61 black and 26 white rhinos mainly in Etosha, where 46 rhinos were found dead, Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said.. \"We note with serious concern that our flagship park, Etosha National Park, is a poaching hotspot,\" Mr Muyunda said.. International criminal gangs now use sophisticated equipment to track and tranquilise the animals before hacking off the horn, leaving them bleeding to death.. Poaching in South Africa and Botswana has led to wildlife teams sawing off the rhino horns in order to keep them alive.  . For many generations rhino horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine despite there being no proven medical benefit. . Poaching is also being fuelled by demand in Vietnam, where horns are displayed as a sign of wealth.. The most endangered is the black rhino with just over 5,000 still alive.. However, elephant poaching in Namibia has declined from a high of 101 in 2015 to four last year.. This video can not be played. Colchester Zoo welcomes birth of Southern white rhino calf. ",

        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending jets.. Ukraine has long been pushing its allies to send advanced war planes to help Kyiv take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's top military officials say there should be no taboos on such military aid - but the US and its partners fear this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.. US-made F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets - mostly MiGs - Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991.. However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, reversing its earlier stance on the issue. The UK and Germany also . Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when his government had just committed to sending Leopard 2 tanks. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macon said on Monday that \"by definition, nothing is excluded\", referring to military assistance to Ukraine. But he stressed that it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is now in Paris, where he is expected to discuss the issue with top French officials.. Poland - another key ally of Ukraine - has also not ruled out sending F-16s to Kyiv. However, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any such move would only be possible \"in complete co-ordination\" with other Nato members.. Andriy Yermak, the head of President Zelensky's office, said that Ukraine had received \"positive signals\" from Warsaw.. Moscow has repeatedly accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. .

        "content": "Canada's federal government granted the request by the west coast province to try out the three-year experiment. . It follows a similar policy in the nearby US state of Oregon, which decriminalised hard drugs in 2020. . Ahead of the pilot's launch, British Columbia and federal officials outlined the rules under the federally approved exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.. While those substances will remain illegal, adults found in possession of a combined total of less than 2.5g of the drugs will not be arrested, charged or have their substances seized. Instead, they will be offered information on available health and social services.. Federal minister of mental health and addictions Carolyn Bennett on Monday called the move \"a monumental shift in drug policy that favours fostering trusting and supportive relationships in health and social services over further criminalisation\".. Some 10,000 residents have died from drug overdoses since British Columbia declared drugs to be a public health emergency in 2016, officials said. . This video can not be played. Vancouver's unusual approach offers opioid users injection sites, antidotes and even heroin on prescription.. \"Decriminalising people who use drugs breaks down the fear and shame associated with substance use and ensures they feel safer reaching out for life-saving supports,\" said Jennifer Whiteside, the British Columbia minister for mental health and addictions.. Thousands of police officers in the province have been offered training on the rule change, including those in Vancouver, the largest city in the province. . The programme will run from 31 January 2023 until 31 January 2026, unless it is revoked by the federal government.. Some experts have questioned the 2.5g limit, saying that it is not enough to account for the habits of many addicts. . There are some exemptions to the scheme.. The sale of drugs remains illegal. It is also illegal to possess drugs on the grounds of schools, childcare facilities and airports.. Canada legalised the use of recreational cannabis for adults nationwide in 2018.. But the four drugs now allowed in small quantities remain prohibited, meaning there are no plans to sell them in stores, unlike marijuana. Trafficking them across borders also remains illegal. . ",

        "content": "The court petition disputes a 2016 amendment to Lisa Marie's will that ousted Priscilla as the estate trustee. . The document misspelled her mother's name and had a signature that appeared unusual, Ms Presley's lawyers argue. . In a filing to the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for the 77-year-old said that she only became aware of the \"purported 2016 amendment\" after Lisa Marie's death. . Replacing her as trustee would mean she was no longer overseeing her daughter's assets.. It is not clear how much that estate is worth but various lawsuits in recent years suggest Lisa Marie's finances were in turmoil, . The amendment to her will that is now in question removes her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaces them with two of her children Riley, 33, and Benjamin Keough. . Benjamin Keough died in 2020 at the age of 27. Riley Keough is an actress with credits including 2020 film The Devil All the Time and the Amazon series The Terminal List.. According to the legal challenge, Ms Presley argues that the amendment was never delivered to her during her daughter's lifetime, as specifically required by the will. . The amendment to Lisa Marie's will also \"misspells her mother's name\" and bears a signature by Lisa Marie that \"appears inconsistent with her usual and customary signature\", says the court filing seen by the BBC..

The legal action comes less than a week after the surviving family of Lisa Marie Presley attended a public memorial service for her at the family's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. . At the service, Priscilla read a poem that she said was written by one of Lisa Marie's three daughters. All three of them, including Riley, were present for the service. .
