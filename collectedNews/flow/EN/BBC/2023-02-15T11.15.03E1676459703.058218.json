        "content": "He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year.. He was captain of the Thai boys' football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. . His emaciated but grinning face caught in the light of a diver after the boys were found in the cave was one of the most memorable images from the remarkable rescue. . In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Promthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Leicestershire. \"Today my dream has come true,\" he wrote. . Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. . News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. \"May Dom's soul rest in peace,\" said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks.. Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. . \"You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it,\" wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Promthep in 2018.. \"When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together.\" . Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: \"Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream. You are one of the persons that pushes me and makes me wanting to improve myself to your level. If the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom.\". After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Promthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai on their bicycles. It was one of the team's favourite haunts.. But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave - which was Thailand's fourth biggest cave system - to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. . They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. . Promthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25.. The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue.. They were eventually brought out of the cave after being sedated with the drug ketamine.. The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year..

        "content": "Rescue helicopters there had rescued about 300 people stranded on rooftops.  . The cyclone has moved away from New Zealand but about 10,500 people were still displaced on Wednesday.. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on Wednesday evening said there were also \"several people missing for whom the police do hold grave concerns.\". Meanwhile, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake was widely felt across the country late on Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which struck off the coast of the North Island near the capital Wellington.. While the rain has ceased in most parts, many remote towns and areas remain cut off by high floodwaters and a lack of power.. New Zealand's prime minister Chris Hipkins has called Gabrielle the biggest weather event to hit the country in the past century. It's estimated to affect at least a third of the country's five million population.. The storm's damage has been most extensive in coastal communities on the far north and east coast of the North Island - with areas like Hawke's Bay, Coromandel and Northland among the worst hit.. The situation in Hawke's Bay, a popular tourist destination with some remote towns, was of particular concern to authorities, said Emergency Management Minister Kieran McAnulty.. As the cyclone hit on Monday night, residents in Hawke's Bay had been forced to swim through bedroom windows as the water level rose.. \"In some cases, flood waters were up to the second storey of homes where people were being rescued,\" a military spokesperson said. . At least three people have died in the area. One woman was killed in a landslide at her home, while another person was found dead on the shoreline, authorities said. Police said they believed the child was caught in rising water.. The body of a missing firefighter who had been caught in a landslide in west of Auckland was also found on Tuesday.. Mr McAnulty on Wednesday said it would be unsurprising if the death toll rose further.. But he hailed the \"phenomenal\" effort of rescue workers who plucked \"roughly 300 people from rooftops\" in Hawke's Bay, with 60 people rescued from one large building marooned by floodwaters.. This video can not be played. Watch: Helicopters reach flood-hit homes and assess cyclone devastation. On Wednesday, more than 140,000 people across the island were still without power, although electricity had been restored to 80,000 homes. . Residents in hard-hit areas are also being asked to conserve water and food because of fears of shortages.. New Zealand announced a national state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows it streamline its response to the disaster.. The country has only previously declared a national state of emergency on two occasions - during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.. New Zealand's climate minister has attributed to the scale of the disaster to climate change.. \"The severity of it, of course, [is] made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees,\" said James Shaw in parliament on Tuesday.. \"We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.\". Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand's North Island just two weeks after record downpours and flooding in the same region. Four people died in those floods.. ",

The flight was going normally until 71 seconds after take-off from Kahului Airport when it suddenly dropped in elevation, according to Flightradar24, an aviation website.. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates US plane crashes, will produce a report about the incident within three weeks.. Passenger Rod Williams told CNN: \"There were a number of screams on the plane. Everybody knew that something was out of the ordinary, or at least that this was not normal.\". He said it was \"sobering\" to think they were probably about five seconds away from hitting the water.. The flight's pilots filed an internal safety report after landing, a United Airlines representative told BBC News. They have a combined 25,000 hours of flying experience.. An investigation by the airline resulted in additional training for the pilots, which United said was ongoing.. \"Safety remains our highest priority,\" a company official said in a statement.. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also received a report of the incident, the federal agency says, and \"took appropriate action\". It did not elaborate.. The incident is among a number of potentially dangerous events reported by US airlines recently, including two near misses in New York and Texas this year.. The NTSB is already looking into two close calls within the last month.. On 4 February, a FedEx cargo plane aborted its landing to avoid a Southwest Airlines plane at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas.. At John F Kennedy Airport in New York in January, a Delta flight stopped short on the runway during take-off to avoid an American Airlines plane.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "US and Canadian officials have not yet located or recovered any wreckage from the three downed aircraft. . Beijing earlier accused the US of \"a trigger-happy overreaction\".. China has denied one of its balloons, which was destroyed by a US fighter jet earlier this month off South Carolina, was being used for espionage, saying it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown off course.. At Tuesday's daily news conference, Mr Kirby said it will be difficult to determine the purpose or origin of the three other objects that were destroyed over Alaska, Canada and Michigan until the debris is found and analysed.. \"We haven't seen any indication or anything that points specifically to the idea that these three objects were part of the PRC's [People's Republic of China] spying programme,\" the White House National Security Council told reporters, \"or that they were definitively involved in external intelligence collection efforts\".. A \"leading explanation\" being considered by US intelligence, he added, was that \"these could be balloons that were simply tied to commercial or research entities and therefore benign\".. But he noted that no company, organisation or government had yet laid claim to the objects.. In the most recent strike - over Lake Huron - the first Sidewinder missile fired by a US F-16 warplane missed its target, the top US general has confirmed.. \"First shot missed. Second shot hit,\" said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley during a visit to Brussels on Tuesday.. \"We go to great lengths to make sure that the airspace is clear and the backdrop is clear up to the max effective range of the missile. And in this case, the missiles land, or the missile landed, harmlessly in the water of Lake Huron.\". A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, criticised the American response.. \"Many in the US have been asking, 'what good can such costly action possibly bring to the US and its taxpayers?'\" said Wang Wenbin on Tuesday.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. Sensors from the alleged Chinese spy balloon shot down over the US on 4 February were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean on Monday, and are being analysed by the FBI.. Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\" off the coast of South Carolina, said US Northern Command.. The Chinese balloon was being tracked by US intelligence since its lift-off from a base on Hainan Island on the south coast of China earlier this month, US media report. . Shortly after take-off the balloon drifted towards the US islands of Guam and Hawaii before moving north towards Alaska, American officials told CBS News, the BBC's partner.. The unnamed officials say that its path indicates that it could have been blown off course by weather, but that it was back under the Chinese control again by the time it reached the continental US. . The entire US Senate received a classified briefing on Tuesday about the matter from military leaders.. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the chamber would launch an inquiry into why the aircraft were not detected earlier.. \"It's a good question,\" Mr Schumer told reporters. \"We need to answer it.\" . Meanwhile, Romania scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday to investigate an aerial object entering European airspace.. But the country's defence ministry said the pilots were unable to locate it and abandoned the mission after half an hour. . .. Use this form to ask your question: .

But they now allege the men were involved in an international drug shipment and are urging them to turn themselves in.. Authorities initially praised the trio when they were rescued near Eclipse Island, 17km south of Albany in WA, issuing a press release saying their case \"highlighted the importance of wearing a lifejacket and carrying an emergency beacon\".. But WA police soon found inconsistencies in the trio's story and contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who started an investigation.. Six days after the men were rescued, a black plastic-wrapped package containing parcels of cocaine was found on a beach 54km (33 miles) west of Albany.. And the next day an overturned cabin cruiser was discovered with eight similarly wrapped packages, each containing about 40kg of cocaine.. Police believe the drugs were collected from the ocean and being ferried to shore in the boat. How the drugs were initially left in the ocean is not known.. Detectives have now asked the public to help locate Mate Stipinovich, 49, and Karl Whitburn, 45, from Perth, and 36-year-old Aristides Avlontis, who is thought to be in the Northern Territory.. One of the WA men is the registered owner of the capsized boat, police say.. AFP Acting Commander Graeme Marshall said the seizure of the drugs would deal a \"significant blow\" to a \"well-resourced syndicate\".. \"The AFP estimates this seizure has saved the community more than $235m in drug-related harm, including associated crime, healthcare and loss of productivity,\" he said..
