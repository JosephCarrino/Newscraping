        "content": "It follows four attacks across Afghanistan on Thursday - all claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). . The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a key security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.. No-one has admitted carrying out Friday's attack in Kunduz, which came as worshippers gathered to pray. . A local shopkeeper told AFP news agency: \"The sight at the mosque was horrifying.\". The explosion was similar to Thursday's bomb which tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 31 people  and wounding 87. . Thursday's attack in Kunduz killed four people and wounded 18. . Admitting those attacks, IS said it was part of an ongoing global campaign to \"avenge\" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman.. Bomb attacks in Afghanistan have declined considerably since the Taliban came to power last August following the withdrawal of US and other Western forces after 20 years in the country.. IS does not control any territory in Afghanistan, but since their rivals, the Taliban, took power, they have been carrying out attacks in areas where they previously never had a presence, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Pakistan.. Sufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in the region for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.. IS militants also target the Taliban, with whom they have a fierce rivalry.. Responding to the attacks, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described the perpetrators as \"evil elements\", adding \"serious efforts are being made to arrest and punish them\".. The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Ramiz Alakbarov said the attacks this week were \"a painful reminder of the insecurity and dangers facing the Afghan people daily\". . \"The indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, which has already caused more than 100 civilian casualties this week, is unacceptable and must cease immediately,\" Mr Alakbarov said in a statement on Friday. .

        "content": "While suicides contributed to the toll, the data shows that homicides form the majority of gun-related deaths. . More than 390 million guns are owned by US civilians.. According to the research - which was published this week in the .  - the rise in gun-related deaths among Americans between the ages of one and 19 was part of an overall 33.4% increase in firearm homicides nationwide. . Homicides, the study noted, disproportionately impact young Americans. . Over the same time period, the rate of firearm suicides in the US rose by 1.1%. . The overall rate of gun deaths of all reasons - suicide, homicide, unintentional and undetermined - among children and teenagers rose by 29.5%, more than twice that of the wider population. . \"We continue to fail to protect our youth from a preventable cause of death,\" said a research letter published in the journal on Wednesday. . The rate of gun-related deaths per 100,000 residents rose among both men and women and across ethnic demographics between 2019 and 2020, with the largest increase among black Americans.  . In past years, gun-related deaths were second only to car crashes as the leading cause of death among young Americans. Car deaths, however, have fallen over time and in 2020 approximately 3,900 Americans under 19 died in vehicle crashes. . Incidents of drug overdoses and poisonings rose 83.6% between 2019 and 2020, and now are the third leading cause of death in that age group. A separate .  published earlier in April found that 954 young people died of overdoses in 2020, compared to 492 in 2019. . Gun violence in the US has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020. . \"The reasons for the increase are unclear,\" the research letter said. \"It cannot be assumed that firearm-related mortality will later revert to pre-pandemic levels\". . A separate study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults - just under 3% of the population - became first-time gun owners during the pandemic between January and April 2021. . This, in turn, exposed 11 million people to household firearms, including five million children. . This video can not be played.

        "content": "Women and children in a crowded room can be heard saying they are running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated from the southern city.. Some say they have seen no daylight for weeks, having been there from February.. The BBC has not verified the video, believed to be filmed on 21 April.. On the same day, President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks, and ordered his troops to seal it off instead. . Moscow also declared itself to be in full control of the strategic city - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says Russian troops were simply unable to seize the Azovstal steelworks.. The plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is a huge industrial site in central Mariupol. . Taking the Sea of Azov port - which has been almost erased by weeks of heavy Russian bombardment - is a key Kremlin war aim, and would release more troops to join an ongoing Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. The footage was posted online on 23 April. . The Azov regiment, which was originally a far-right group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard, says it shows its fighters delivering food and other aid to women and children in one of the Azovstal underground bunkers.. Big signs reading \"Children\" in red paint are seen on the walls leading to the room. One woman, who is not named, is heard saying more than 15 children - from babies to those aged 14 - are sheltering there.. Another unnamed woman is seen on camera telling how she has been sheltering since 25 February - the second day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. One of the children, a girl, says she left her house together with her mother and grandmother on 27 February. . \"We haven't seen the sky or the sun since. We want to get out of here very much. We want it to be safe for us, so no-one is hurt, and then live in safety.\". The girl says she wants to be able to go to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where one of her brothers has managed to escape to from Kharkiv - a heavily-bombed city in the north-east.. \"I want to get out… to be in safety. I don't want to risk getting out only to be hit by bomb fragments, for example,\" she adds.. Weaving deep through what the battalion say is the Azovstal steelwork tunnels, the video shows an underground rabbit warren, filled with families and young children. . It is difficult to verify the video, but if accurate it is a rare glimpse of life in the Azovstal plant and a final push by the Azov regiment to ensure that the situation in Mariupol is at the forefront of global attention as the Russian army seal it off. . The Russian media have portrayed their brutal campaign in Mariupol as a way to \"de-Nazify and demilitarise\" Ukraine. This video has been released to replace that image with one of fear and desperation in the eyes of children who say they've not seen the sun in one-and-a-half months, asking to be evacuated. This video is an attempt to control the narrative about what is happening on the ground. . The Azov regiment is controversial; it was originally a far-right group. This video shows them as approachable warriors, fist-bumping children and bringing them supplies, while other images on social media show Russian soldiers standing outside burning buildings and Russian tanks rolling through the city.. Earlier this week, one of the commanders of Azov told the BBC that many civilians, including children, were sheltering at the site. He also said dead Ukrainian fighters were there.. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula, to fight against Russian forces and pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Donbas region. . Some of Azov fighters originally had links to nationalist and far-right groups. The regiment was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. . The regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in Mariupol.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "He said Marine Le Pen's far right was fuelled by unhappiness and risked a society of hate and fracture.. It was proof of his weakness, she said, that he used old insults of extremism.. The opinion polls give the sitting president the edge in the second round run-off, but Ms Le Pen's far right party has never been this close to power which is why the stakes are so high.. The number one issue in this election has been the spiralling cost of living, from energy bills and food shopping to the price of filling up a car. It was identified very early on by the Le Pen team, who have promised a government of national unity to attack the high cost of living, as well as a referendum on immigration and a ban on wearing headscarves in public. . Her simple message to voters has been: \"It's Macron or France\".. Mr Macron also kept his message brief: \"This election is a form of referendum, on secularism and on Europe.\" He argues Ms Le Pen's idea of a \"Europe of nations\" would mean an end to the EU.. He invoked the UK's vote to leave the EU and the presidency of Donald Trump in a TV appeal to voters. \"There are millions of people who, a few hours before Brexit, decided what was the point in going to vote. Millions did the same in 2016 with Trump. The next day they woke up with a hangover,\" he said.. Accusing him of insulting both her and those who voted for her, Ms Le Pen said France had endured five years of chaos and could rediscover civil peace and respect. \"We won't find it with the same man and the same type of rule,\" she said.. The biggest issue for both candidates is the large number of voters who are set to cast blank ballots or not even vote at all. The polls suggest turnout could be the lowest since 1969.. \"I'm going to vote blank because it's my national duty to cast my vote, but I still want to show my unhappiness with the system,\" Edrisi, a voter in a southern suburb of Paris, told me.. The dissatisfaction with Mr Macron's brand of centrism and with mainstream politics was laid bare in the first round, when well over half the electorate backed the far right or far left. . More than one in five voters backed far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who came third, narrowly behind Marine Le Pen.. Many in France have not forgotten the .  or yellow-vest protests over fuel costs and rising prices that erupted 18 months after Mr Macron came to power. Ms Le Pen has exploited claims that he is a president for the rich.. The final polls suggest the sitting president will win between 53% and 57% of the vote, so there are big question marks over who those 7.7 million Mélenchon voters will back. According to an Ipsos poll on Friday, 48% of people who voted for Mélenchon in the first round support neither candidate in the final round. . While one in three of those far-left voters will back Mr Macron, there are a sizeable number who dislike him so much they would rather vote for the far right.. Campaigning ended at midnight French time (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and the two teams are now required by law to halt electioneering until voting ends on Sunday evening.. As the sun went down in Paris, one of the rising stars of Mr Macron's party joined party activists in handing out leaflets in a last-ditch appeal for votes.. Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie said the government was acutely aware that a disaffected public needed to be brought closer to mainstream politics: \"Maybe it will be one of the major issues of a new Macron period, if he's re-elected. Everyone in politics has to consider the way we make and enact policy. And if people don't feel their lives are getting better, then they won't see the use of politics and they won't vote.\". This video can not be played. It has been an unusual election from the start, overshadowed first by the Covid pandemic and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which meant Mr Macron only engaged with voters eight days before the first round.. Even though 12 candidates took part in that initial race, only three performed well. The two mainstream parties that traditionally ran France until the meteoric rise of Emmanuel Macron in 2017 attracted little over two million votes between them.. The campaign did eventually burst into life on Wednesday night, when the two final candidates sparred for almost three hours on live TV, with the moderators barely getting involved.. And it continued right until the final moments of Friday, with the head of Ms Le Pen's National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, promising to save public money and return it to the French people..

It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned by the Kremlin, but they were widely cited in Russian state media including the Interfax and Tass news agencies.. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were \"looking into\" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. . Meanwhile, a senior EU official told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. . Moldova has summoned Moscow's ambassador over the comments, which its foreign ministry described as \"deeply concerning\".. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west.

Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region on Friday. . \"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,\" Gen Minnekayev said. .

Ukraine's defence ministry denounced Gen Minnekayev's comments as Russian \"imperialism\". . And the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to them in his regular overnight address. \"The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries,\" he claimed..
