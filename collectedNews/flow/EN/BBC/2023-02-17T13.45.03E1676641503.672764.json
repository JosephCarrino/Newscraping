        "content": "The losses are the third biggest in French corporate history and the worst for more than 20 years.. EDF's debts have spiralled to €64.5bn.. The losses are in marked contrast to EDF's UK-based business, which made an underlying profit of £1.12bn supplying electricity and gas to five million households.. In France, President Emmanuel Macron's government responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by imposing a tariff \"shield\" for consumers, limiting energy companies to a 4% rise in 2022 followed by 15% in 2023, keeping inflation lower than in other European countries.. But it meant that EDF had to sell power to French consumers at a loss, while UK consumers paid far more for their energy. EDF has around 80% of France's electricity market.. French industry has not seen such poor results since 2002, when Vivendi Universal and France Telecom both posted losses above €20bn for the previous year.. EDF has never before reported such large losses. . \"The 2022 results were significantly affected by the decline in our electricity output, and also by exceptional regulatory measures introduced in France in difficult market conditions,\" said Chief Executive Luc Remont, who said EDF's priority was now to put the company back on track. He said core earnings would be significantly higher in 2023.. EDF's nuclear output in France fell by 30% to its lowest since 1988 as more than half of its 56 ageing nuclear power stations went offline for repairs, which had been delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. France has the biggest fleet of nuclear plants in Europe.. The outages meant that France became a net importer of electricity for the first time in decades.. EDF's financial woes have various causes, but another major factor is an obligation it has to sell a quarter of its production at a fixed price to its competitors.. The system known as Arenh (Regulated Access to Historic Nuclear Electricity) was devised in 2010 in order to satisfy the EU, which was worried about EDF - with its massive nuclear capacity - becoming a monopoly provider.. It meant the French electricity market was able to open up to competition, but EDF says it has forced the company into the absurd situation of subsidising its competitors.. In 2022 things became \"surreal\" in the words of one former CEO.  Because of the soaring cost of electricity on the European market, EDF's own generating capacity hit by technical problems, and with the government extending the low price guarantee to customers - EDF was having to buy in electricity at €100 a unit, and sell it to rivals at €46.. And many of these competitors, EDF argues, aren't real players at all but simply market traders.. Three former CEOs have described the system as \"a poison pill\" and have blamed the EU and Germany for rigging the system against France's interests.. Although the French state already controls 84% of EDF, the government has begun a process to fully nationalise the company. Major changes are likely, not least to Arenh.. President Macron has spoken of a renaissance in the nuclear industry, with plans for six new reactors to help France reach carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with EU aims.. ",

On Friday, Taiwan's Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that officials would further investigate the crashed balloon but would not \"jump to conclusions\"..

The US also shot down three other objects it says are unlikely to be foreign spy crafts.. The sphere found on Dongyin was about a metre in diameter and bore the name of a China-based company that, based on online searches, stocks meteorological and radio appliances.. The company Taiyuan Radio No 1 Factory Co. Ltd is based in Taiyuan, one of China's main industrial bases and capital of Shanxi province.. The sphere was also marked \"GTS13 digital atmospheric sounding instrument\" and \"meteorological instrument\", with simplified Chinese language characters, the military said in a statement.. China has used simplified Chinese characters since the 1950s, but Taiwan continues to use traditional characters.. Authorities have not released pictures of the object.. Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday that it had not detected any Chinese surveillance balloons, but it had spotted weather balloons previously. It also said it would not hesitate to shoot down any balloon it deemed a threat.. These comments came after the Financial Times reported earlier this week - citing unnamed officials - that dozens of Chinese military balloons had been spotted in Taiwan's airspace in recent years.. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. . But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.. ",

Members of the Ver.di union and Civil Service Association are demanding a 10.5% pay increase for workers. . At Leipzig Airport, a handful of international flights got away this morning but domestic flights were cancelled.. At Frankfurt Airport, a couple of passengers wheeled suitcases through what is usually the bustling departures terminal. It was, one local TV reporter noted, almost as empty as it had been during the Covid pandemic.  . The action coincided with the start of the high-profile gathering of world leaders and defence experts at the Munich Security Conference. . The arrival of prominent guests was not expected to be affected but other delegates were advised to travel by train. . Airports handling emergency aid for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria have said that those cargo flights would continue as scheduled. . But the strike - which comes two days after .  - has prompted a furious response from some German business leaders. . Representatives of small and medium business associations condemned the action as unacceptable and accused the unions of taking the whole country hostage for their own interests.. And air passengers in Germany are becoming accustomed - even resigned - to this kind of disruption. . Last summer, staff shortages led to chaotic scenes at airports as flights were delayed and cancelled and travellers queued for hours at check in and security. . A representative for Ver.di said that, unless pay and working conditions improved, those issues would continue and guarantee another turbulent summer at the country's airports.  . Lufthansa has already announced it will have to reduce its summer programme as a result of staff shortages. . Germany's unions are well organised and it's rare to see picket lines because most employees participate in strikes. But workers are expected to hold demonstrations at various airports throughout the day. . Their demands have thus far been rejected by employers who are yet to submit their own offer with talks expected to continue next week. And the leader of Ver.di, Frank Werneke, struck a threatening tone earlier.. \"The next strikes will have a different dimension,\" he said. \"Unless the employers table a good offer next week, this will be just a taste of what's to come.\".

        "content": "They've been here for nine days and nights but their loved ones have not been found.. This personal grief is being played out in the rubble of one of the most desirable streets money can buy here.. \"This is one of the most luxurious residential areas in Gaziantep,\" says musician Yunus Emre, whose cousin and his family of four are missing. \"The wealthiest live here. Those flats are sold for millions.\". But the price of the property in this city meant nothing when the earthquake struck.. \"I'm just angry. I want to bring someone to justice but I don't know who,\" says the 28-year-old. For him, so many parties are culpable in what is not just a national tragedy but, with the collapse of so many buildings, a national scandal.. \"It starts with the contractor,\" he explains. . \"He uses low-quality building material. Next comes the certifying authority. They have the blood of people who died here on their hands. . \"It's not right to scapegoat the contractor. The ones who approved this building are responsible together with the government and the state. They shouldn't have signed off on this building project at all.\". The Ayşe Mehmet Polat apartment complex is 24 years old. Four of its six blocks collapsed while other buildings around it stood tall. Safety concerns had been raised by residents long before last week's deadly tremors. . We came to this site because we had heard that a man said to be the building's contractor had been arrested. He will later tell us through his lawyer he was doing nothing wrong and should bear no responsibility.  . We spend three days looking at what happened here on 6 February.. As we return to the complex the next morning, emergency services reveal to us a shocking figure - 136 people are known to have died here as they slept. . At a petrol station next door, we ask if they have any CCTV footage of when the earthquakes struck. We are given videos from four separate cameras which show the horror unfolding. First, the violent shaking of the lights, then seconds later, people running for their lives before, finally, a thick cloud of smoke and dust enveloping everything in its path.. The neighbouring apartment buildings collapsed in a matter of seconds.. This video can not be played. Watch: CCTV from a petrol station next to the apartment complex shows when one of the earthquakes struck. As we leave the petrol station, we are drawn to the pile of personal possessions on the edge of the forecourt. It is a deeply upsetting museum of lives suddenly extinguished - homework, dolls, cooking pans and family photos. Scouring the heap, and sobbing inconsolably, is 65-year-old Emel Filik.. \"Everything is gone,\" she tells us.. She explains that her cousin had been sleeping in one of the four destroyed blocks, and no-one had taken responsibility for keeping the building safe. . \"Once you start to live in your flat, nothing happens. No inspection. Earthquake insurance and property insurance don't work either. The municipality doesn't make checks. No such thing as monitoring.\". There had been concerns about these apartments, she says, adding that the head of the residents' association - a woman known as Selma - had even asked neighbours to come to a meeting to listen to her fears.. \"Six months ago, Selma told us about the problems of the building. She said 'Dear residents, our buildings might collapse at the slightest of earthquakes. Let's strengthen the pillars. If you're short on money, the municipality could help us for a cheaper solution.' She held several meetings. But nothing happened.\". We find a phone number for Selma and she confirms she held meetings to express her fears.. But should residents really have to pay to be safe in their own homes? This was a question of structural integrity, not repainting walls.. The head of the organisation representing architects in Turkey, Eyüp Muhçu, tells us the ultimate responsibility for making sure buildings are safe rests with the Turkish government. . \"The priority of the central government was not to make the cities safe, but to implement some projects that were solely planned for maximising profits. For this reason, 65% of the current building stock in Turkey is risky. And no measures have been implemented regarding these risky structures.\". With two residents having told us there had been potential problems within the blocks - we start trying to find out if those responsible for the building knew about it and whether they did anything.. When we had first arrived at the block the previous night, a boy had come up to us briefly to say his dad had pulled seven people from the rubble with his bare hands. It sounded a remarkable story, given the scale of the destruction we could see, but we didn't discount it.. And sure enough, when we hear others talking about the bravery of a man called Bahattin Aşan we decide to track him down.. \"I saw the building twirling and crashing down. I came here running, it was dark, raining, there was snow and I was the first responder,\" he tells us.. Bahattin Aşan used to work as a security guard at the housing complex.. He shows us a harrowing video he took in the smoking ruins, in which he's calling out to those trapped. Some people reply. . \"I rescued seven people by myself. It was like the apocalypse. Even now as I'm telling you this, I'm still shaking,\" he says.. But what about these supposed concerns over the buildings' safety, I ask? Did he see this? . \"In the car park, I witnessed the defects with my own eyes. When I touched the concrete columns it would crumble to dust in my hands, as though it wasn't concrete at all. Iron was rusting in the columns, the rainfall was damaging and corroded the iron.\" . When I ask Bahattin Aşan if he ever reported this, he insists it was obvious to the management as well as the residents.. \"I used to tell a friend that if they were to give me a flat here I wouldn't take it. I said it was because I didn't think the columns were solid and in an earthquake the building would collapse.\". But the man accused of being the contractor, Mehmet Akay, says the building complied with regulation at the time it was built. He claims that sewage and water works were added to the property after construction - and that this, or other work, may have damaged the supporting columns.. How many other security guards and caretakers across Turkey had voiced similar concerns in a country precariously positioned at the crossroads of shifting tectonic plates?. The immediate picture that is emerging in this Gaziantep neighbourhood is not of a cover-up or conspiracy - but either indifference or inaction.. Everyone knew there was a problem, but nobody did anything. . For opposition MP Garo Paylan, from the HDP party, who we meet as he visits this site, it is indicative of criminal negligence on an industrial scale in Turkish construction and oversight.  . \"This is a crime. This is a sin.\". Mr Paylan accuses the government of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of failing to ensure the safety of new buildings as well as failing to strengthen older ones.. \"The scientists were shouting about it, this disaster is coming, but the government did almost nothing. We warned the cities, we warned them to prepare the rescue teams, but they did nothing and we live this catastrophe. They say this is destiny. No, it is not. In civilised countries these kinds of disasters happen but fewer people die. But here we have tens of thousands of people under the rubble.\". Mehmet Akay, the man whom authorities say was the building contractor for the Ayşe Mehmet Polat complex, was arrested on Saturday 11 February - five days after the earthquakes. He was stopped at Istanbul Airport as he tried to leave the country. . State prosecutors say he was the building contractor, but responding to questions put to him through his lawyer, Mr Akay claims he was the construction co-ordinator, but not the contractor. He also rejects accusations that cheap building materials were used. . In Gaziantep, we ask the local authority, Şehitkamil Municipality, for a response. Spokesman Ahmet Aydın Sert says no complaints were received about the complex buildings, and therefore no inspections were made. \"We went through the records and found no irregularities.\" . President Erdogan has conceded that the emergency response to the disaster was slow in places, but has urged his people not to listen to those whom he accuses of politicising a tragedy.. His government denies negligence and claims that more than 98% of buildings that collapsed were older - like the Ayşe Mehmet Polat complex - and built before the ruling party took office. . There are plenty who would say every country has a moral - if not legal - duty to protect its citizens, no matter the age of their property.. And when Turks go to the polls in the summer they will decide for themselves who can best ensure their families are safe in their own homes.. ",
