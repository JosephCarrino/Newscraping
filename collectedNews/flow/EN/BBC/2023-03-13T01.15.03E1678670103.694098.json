It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. The move came as the firm, a key tech lender, was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. \"The US banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,\" the authorities' joint statement said.. \"Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe.\". SVB was seen as a crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector. It was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. . But it came under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Meanwhile, . . A consortium of investors led by the Bank of London, a UK clearing bank, has submitted a formal bid to the UK Treasury. . The British government has been working on a plan to support UK tech firms affected by the collapse of SVB.. ",

        "content": "He was arrested in 2014 while crossing the border from Jordan into Saudi Arabia, accused of smuggling amphetamines.   . He was later sentenced to death, after a trial criticised by Amnesty International as \"grossly unfair\".  . His sister, Zeinab Abul Al-Khair, said he had told her from jail that he had been strung up by his feet and beaten.  . \"He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" she told me earlier this year.. His case has drawn international concern, with fears for his fate growing after Saudi Arabia last November ended an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty for drugs offences. Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed on such charges.. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had found that Mr Abu al-Khair's detention lacked legal basis.   . And in late 2022, the UN Human Rights office appealed for his release.  . It says the use of the death penalty for drug offences is incompatible with international norms and standards.. \"We urge the Saudi government to halt al-Kheir's reported imminent execution and to comply with the Working Group's opinion by quashing his death sentence, releasing him immediately and unconditionally, and by ensuring that he receives medical care, compensation and other reparations,\" said spokesperson Liz Throssell.. The announcement that Hussein Abu al-Khair had been put to death was made on the Saudi press agency and comes a year to the day since the biggest mass execution in modern Saudi history.. Campaign group Reprieve said the Saudi authorities had not warned his family that he was about to be executed - or given them the chance to say goodbye. . It has been highly critical of Saudi Arabia's allies, including the UK, for not taking a stronger stand against human rights abuses in the Kingdom. . \"Exactly a year ago, Mohammed bin Salman's regime executed 81 men in a single day, and Saudi Arabia's international partners shrugged and issued empty statements about the importance of human rights,\" said Reprieve's director, Maya Foa.  . \"Rather than condemn the Crown Prince, world leaders queued up to shake his bloodstained hands. Today's atrocity and others like it is the inevitable result. When partners signal that the Saudi regime can kill without consequences, you can be sure it will,\" she added. . Mr Abu al-Khair's case was raised in the UK parliament in late November - with a Foreign Office minister answering an Urgent Question about a surge of executions in Saudi Arabia by saying that the authorities had \"clearly\" tortured him and describing his treatment as \"abhorrent\".. The following week the minister, David Rutley, asked for his words to be struck from the parliamentary record, . Responding to news of the execution, Conservative MP David Davis said: \"The UK government knew Hussein Abu al-Khair was at imminent risk, but the foreign secretary failed to publicly call for his execution to be halted, despite his predecessors taking this kind of action in the past. . \"The UK must signal it will no longer turn a blind eye to executions like these, and speak out strongly on behalf of others who remain at risk, including child defendants like Abdullah al-Howaiti.\". The Saudi Press Agency said the Ministry of the Interior was announcing that the death penalty had been implemented against Hussein Abu al-Khair to \"confirm the keenness of the Kingdom's government to combat drugs of all kinds because of the severe harm they cause to the individual and society\"..

        "content": " including that of an unborn child. . The attack took place shortly after worshippers finished their service. Police have told them that they cannot rule out the possibility of a so-called copycat attack, says Michael Tsifidaris, who speaks for the community here.  . He's smartly dressed in a business suit, but looks exhausted. It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.. He tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.. \"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\". The fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.  . There are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.. Detectives investigating the .  have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".. Mr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.. Those who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".. The police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.. \"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris. . \"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\". For now, the community is meeting online. Mr Tsifidaris, who refers to his fellow members as brothers and sisters, speaks often of the comfort to be found in supporting one another. \"We pray together, we cry together.\". Uppermost in their thoughts are those who remain seriously injured in hospital. He's adamant that their treatment is not compromised by a refusal to accept blood transfusions - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God forbids this.. They are not yet out of danger, he tells us, but the doctors say there's a fair chance most will survive. . For now, the focus is on supporting the bereaved and the traumatised. No one, he says, is left alone in their grief. . This attack has left a city in mourning and a community in shock and horror. It will, says Mr Tsifidaris, take years to heal. . ",

America's ExxonMobil made $55.7bn, and Britain's Shell reported $39.9bn.. Aramco also declared a dividend of $19.5bn for the October to December quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.. Most of that will go to the Saudi government, which owns nearly 95% of the shares in the company. . Brent crude oil, the benchmark oil price, now trades at around $82 a barrel - though prices .  after Russia's invasion, and June.. \"Aramco rode the wave of high energy prices in 2022,\" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"It would have been difficult for Aramco not to perform strongly in 2022.\". In a statement on Sunday, .  the company results were \"underpinned by stronger crude oil prices, higher volumes sold and improved margins for refined products\".. Aramco's president and CEO Amin Nasser said: \"Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real - including contributing to higher energy prices.\". To address those challenges, he said, the company would not only focus on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production - but also invest in new lower-carbon technologies.. Aramco - the world's second-most valuable company only behind America's Apple - is a major emitter of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.. Responding to Aramco's announcement, Amnesty International's secretary general . : \"It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161bn in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel - the single largest driver of the climate crisis.\". She added: \"It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\". Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).. The Gulf kingdom has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents, and for the widespread use of capital punishment.. In a separate development on Sunday, Iran said its oil exports had reached their highest level since the re-imposition of . Oil Minister Javad Owji said exports increased by 83 million barrels in 2022 compared with the previous 12 months. In Iran, a new year starts in March. . Analysts say the rise is due to greater shipments to Iranian allies China and Venezuela. . Tehran's export revenues took a significant hit after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal five years ago.. The US sanctions, coupled with economic mismanagement and corruption, have meant that the Iranian economy has not had any substantive .  And by some measures, it is still 4-8% smaller than it was back in 2010.. ",
