        "content": "Official attempts to remove it have triggered a backlash on Chinese sites.. Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak.. The .  features audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading.. \"This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,\" another man says.. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat.. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites.. It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown.. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures include .  to prevent those with the virus from leaving and . .. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that \"even the ceiling isn't finished yet\" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into.. \"Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,\" she said.. Other residents shout out \"thank you, big whites!\" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules.. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators.. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: \"The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!\" . \"Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,\" another commentator wrote.. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city.. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free.. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged..

        "content": "In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round.. But these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor.. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.. Polls opened in the run-off vote at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and 48.7 million people are eligible to take part. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00.. Mr Macron rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living.. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last.  . The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout could be historically low.. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration. . Whatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.. The rising cost of living - described in France as .  or spending power - has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins.. She has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era.. She came top two weeks ago in La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, Cécile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: \"Before Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm.\". She will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: \"People can't afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I'm in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat.\" African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds.. There are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that. . She has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a \"Europe of nations\" would tear the EU apart.  . Jean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and take drugs.. This video can not be played. Across France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La Ferté too.. Apprentice accountant Séréna, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: \"We don't really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now.\". Nicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. \"I'm not so worried about her, more about the people behind her - her lieutenants.\". Ms Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.. He was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes. . The town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a Mélenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply.. Outside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right's policies as racist. \"I'm going to vote blank,\" she says. It's a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all.. Many Mélenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. \"Macron is more for the rich than the poor,\" he says, before adding that he could still vote for him.. Unemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and  abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires.. When Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all. . If the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.. What did Putin do before he came to power?. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story. Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle. ",

        "content": "Many were burnt beyond recognition.. High levels of poverty and unemployment have made illegal oil refining an attractive business for many residents of the oil-rich communities in southern Nigeria.. The death toll could rise, with one local official being quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that emergency workers had recovered \"at least 80 badly burnt bodies at the scene\".. \"We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\" Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency said.. The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of the illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. . It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as environmental pollution. . But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country. . What did Putin do before he came to power?.
