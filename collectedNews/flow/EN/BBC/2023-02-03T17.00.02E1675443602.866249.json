China has said the balloon is used for meteorological research and deviated from its route because of bad weather.. US officials have said they are confident the \"surveillance balloon\" floating above the US is Chinese.. A statement from China's Foreign Ministry said that it \"regrets\" the incident and will work with the US to resolve the issue.. Mr Blinken's visit was expected to take place on 5 and 6 February. . A US official quoted by the Associated Press said that the decision to abruptly halt the trip was made by Mr Blinken and President Joe Biden. . ",

        "content": "That was far more than expected, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.4% - the lowest rate since 1969. . Analysts are struggling to figure out what is happening in the world's largest economy, which is being buffeted by a mix of higher borrowing costs and rising prices.. Many forecasters have warned that the odds of a recession this year are unusually high, pointing to data which has indicated a recent pullback in consumer spending, declines in manufacturing and a sharp slowdown in home sales.. A recent survey by research company Morning Consult suggested nearly half of the public thinks the economy has already fallen into recession, or a period of decline.. Despite this, the labour market has remained strong - though the gains in January shocked even those economists who have argued against the gloomy predictions. . \"This is a breathtaking number,\" economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote on Twitter following the report. . The hiring in January was widespread, led by bars and restaurants, which are continuing to recover from job losses sparked by the pandemic. . The car manufacturing and tech industries were among the few parts of the economy to report job losses.. Those sectors are sensitive to borrowing costs, which shot up last year, as the US central bank took steps to stabilise soaring consumer prices.. By raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve is aiming to cool demand, easing the pressures pushing up prices. . However, the increase in rates, coming at a time when price increases have started to ease, has raised fears that officials will tip the economy into a painful contraction, bringing economic activity to an abrupt slowdown that leads to firms to cutting jobs.. The head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said this week he was hopeful the US central bank can avoid that scenario.. But he warned that the Fed was focused on curbing inflation and remained worried that the job market was too strong to allow price growth to stabilise around the bank's 2% target.. Friday's report showed wages rose 4.4% over the 12 months to January.. Pay increases did not keep pace with price inflation last year and have shown signs of cooling in recent months. . \"It's difficult to see how wage pressures can possibly soften sufficiently when jobs growth is as strong as this and it's even more difficult to see the Fed stop raising rates and entertain ideas of rate cuts when there is such explosive economic news coming in,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. . \"The market is going to go through a rollercoaster ride as it tries to decide if this is good or bad news. For now, though, looks like the US economy is doing absolutely fine.\". ",

        "content": "Watch: \"At first I thought it was a star\". US defence officials said they believed the balloon, seen above sensitive areas in recent days, was in fact a \"high-altitude surveillance\" device. . But in a statement, China's foreign ministry said it was used for \"mainly meteorological\" purposes. . China \"regrets the unintended entry\" of the balloon into US airspace, it added.. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, according to officials.. Montana is home to some of the US's nuclear missile silos. . The US decided not to shoot down the balloon because of the danger posed by falling debris, and the limited use of any intelligence the device could gather, a US defence official said. . However, the government prepared fighter jets in case the object had to be shot down. . The Chinese statement said the balloon had been blown off-course by unexpected winds. . \"Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course.. \"The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure.\". The statement referred to the incident as an \"unexpected situation\" and said Beijing would continue to communicate with the US side. . On Friday, Canada said it had summoned China's ambassador over the incident and will continue to \"vigorously express\" its position to Chinese officials. . The balloon has been reported in US media as being about the size of three buses. . During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, US defence officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location and did not give information on where it was launched from.. They added that the balloon was \"appearing to hang out for a longer period of time\" than others tracked by the US over the past several years. . The unfamiliar sight caused confusion as the balloon hovered above Montana, with some people posting images of the pale round object high above the Earth's surface. . Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the \"big white circle in the sky\" and went home to get a better camera.. \"I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,\" he said. \"So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.\". China initially warned against \"conjectures and hyping up the issue\" while it worked to \"verify\" the reports of the balloon, with state media outlet the Global Times accusing the US of aggravating tensions between the two countries. . Despite China's explanation, the incident is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary.. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.. ",

        "content": "It was spotted floating over the state of Montana, days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China.. The top US diplomat is expected to meet China's President Xi Jinping, making him the first in his role to do so.. \"Beijing is probably trying to signal to Washington: 'While we want to improve ties, we are also ever ready for sustained competition, using any means necessary', without severely inflaming tensions.. \"And what better tool for this than a seemingly innocuous balloon,\" independent air-power analyst He Yuan Ming told the BBC. . Balloons are one of the oldest forms of surveillance technology. The Japanese military used them to launch incendiary bombs in the US during World War Two. They were also widely used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.. More recently, the US has reportedly been considering adding high-altitude inflatables into the Pentagon's surveillance network. Modern balloons typically hover between 24km-37km above the earth's surface (80,000ft-120,000ft).. The US Department of Defence on Thursday said . . It also said it had \"very high confidence\" that the balloon belongs to China.. But China expert Benjamin Ho said Beijing had more sophisticated surveillance technology at its disposal. . \"They have other means to spy out American infrastructure, or whatever information they wanted to obtain. The balloon was to send a signal to the Americans, and also to see how the Americans would react,\" explained Dr Ho - coordinator of the China programme at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.. It may even be the case that China wanted the US to detect the balloon. . \"It's possible that being spotted was the whole point. China might be using the balloon to demonstrate that it has a sophisticated technological capability to penetrate US airspace without risking a serious escalation. In this regard, a balloon is a pretty ideal choice,\" said Arthur Holland Michel from the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.. Nevertheless, the experts point out that balloons can be fitted with modern technology like spy cameras and radar sensors, and there are some advantages to using balloons for surveillance - chief of which is that it is less expensive and easier to deploy than drones or satellites. . The balloon's slower speed also allows it to loiter over and monitor the target area for longer periods. A satellite's movement, on the other hand, is restricted to its orbital pass.. Although China has not admitted it launched the balloon, Mr Michel says it is unlikely anyone else could be responsible.. \"The [US Department of Defence] would likely not say that it is a Chinese balloon unless they have a fairly high degree of certainty that that is what it is.\". The balloon's anticipated flight path near certain missile bases suggests it is unlikely it has drifted off course, He Yuan Ming said.. ",
