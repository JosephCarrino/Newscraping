        "content": "That scheme will initially focus on single men crossing the Channel in boats or lorries from France.. The prime minister said it would \"save countless lives\" and break the business model of traffickers, but campaigners have called the plan \"inhumane\".. Two more migrant crossings were recorded on Friday morning despite thick fog, the BBC's Simon Jones said.  . Andrew Griffith MP - director of the No 10 policy unit - said the new scheme would not require new legislation and could be implemented under \"existing conventions\".. He told BBC Newsnight it could therefore be launched \"in weeks or a small number of months\".. He added that, if the flow of illegal migration could be stopped, it would leave \"lots of capacity for the very generous safe and legal routes\" into the UK.. The Rwanda scheme is part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats.. The Royal Navy has taken operational command of the Channel from UK Border Force in an effort to detect every boat headed to the UK.. Some 562 people on 14 boats made the journey on the day the new scheme was announced, according to the Ministry of Defence. No one making the crossing is believed to have arrived on UK soil \"on their own terms\", it added.. Last year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,404 in 2020.. Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force, said it could be weeks before it became clear if the \"radical\" new scheme was feasible.. He told BBC Breakfast the government was likely to face a legal challenge when people are put on aircraft bound for Rwanda.. \"But then I'm not sure what the answer is to stopping the boats… because if we don't do something, then more people are going to drown,\" he said, adding the UK was potentially facing its biggest asylum intake ever.. In a speech on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the agreement with Rwanda would provide \"safe and legal routes for asylum\".. \"Economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the UK, while those with genuine need will be properly protected,\" he said.. He said the scheme would cover anyone who had arrived in the UK illegally since the start of this year.. No one we initially spoke to yesterday seemed to know about the Rwanda announcement - but it wasn't long before word spread.. Soon a group of men was asking us lots of questions: \"When will this happen? Why? If I come from Afghanistan will it still apply to me?\". Shafi, who told me he fled Afghanistan, said: \"[Rwanda] is a lot worse place than Afghanistan, there is no future for us in Rwanda.\". But I didn't meet anyone who said the government's plans would prevent them from trying to cross the Channel, including Shafi, who said he had no choice.. Many of these men have already faced huge risks to get this far and are willing to risk their lives crossing the Channel on a small boat.. The risk of being sent to Rwanda, at this stage, seemed like just another thing to factor in down the line.. More than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged the government to scrap the plan, describing it in an open letter as \"shamefully cruel\".. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said it would do little to deter desperate people and \"only lead to more human suffering\".. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract the country from the Partygate scandal with an \"unworkable, unethical, and extortionate\" scheme. . The Lib Dems said the government was \"slamming the door\" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford called the plan \"absolutely chilling\".. Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was \"not much more than a short-term solution\".. Questions are also being raised about the price of the scheme, with .  reporting a cost of £20,000 to £30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda.. But justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove declined to give such a figure, telling BBC Breakfast it would depend on several factors.. He said the UK was spending nearly £5m a day on hotels, while the new scheme would initially cost £120m, with more money to be given later.. A similar programme in Australia cost an estimated £460m in 2021 but successfully resettled only 239 people - a cost of around £1.9m per person. . Concerns are being raised about the human rights record of Rwanda and its president, Paul Kagame.. Mr Pursglove said Rwanda was a progressive country which wanted to provide sanctuary and had made \"huge strides forward\" in the last three decades.. The minister said it was now one of only two countries in the world with a female-majority parliament and had an antidiscrimination law running \"right through its constitution\".. However, just last year the UK government expressed concern at the United Nations about Rwanda's \"continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom\".. Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International UK, said sending people to the east-African nation was \"the very height of irresponsibility\".. Yolande Makolo, a spokesperson for Rwanda's government, told the BBC it is a \"safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights\".. According to an agreement between the two governments, people sent to Rwanda will get accommodation and support. They will be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times..

        "content": "Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach.. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by the offer.. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: \"I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it.\" . He added that he had a \"Plan B\" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean.. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. \"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" he said.. On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own.. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to \"unlock\" the company's \"extraordinary potential\" and that if his offer was not accepted, \"I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\". He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be \"utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote\". . Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: \"I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects.\". The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: \"What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?\". Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the \"unsolicited, non-binding\" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer.. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder.. Asset management firm Vanguard Group .  that its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot.. This video can not be played. Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive.. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley.. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be \"toying with the company to some extent\".. \"The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think.\". He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders.. \"To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution.. \"I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,\" he added.. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer.. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach.. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. . But details have emerged of an \"all hands\" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. . The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being \"held hostage\". . I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. \"I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,\" they said.. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. \"I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,\" they said. . Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer.. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe..

But with more than 20,000 new cases a day, authorities are struggling to find enough space.. The city in recent weeks has converted exhibition halls and schools into quarantine centres, and set up makeshift hospitals.. The low numbers of serious cases in Shanghai have led some to ask whether a lockdown is necessary, correspondents say.. This video can not be played. In recent weeks many residents have taken to social media to complain about the restrictions and the lack of food supplies.. People have to order in food and water and wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs, and analysts say many are running low on supplies.. The lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies.. Three weeks into lockdown, some here in Shanghai are angry. . Head to toe in protective suits in an eastern district of the city, officers were forcing people out of their rented apartments so they could turn them into temporary quarantine facilities, all in the name of a war against a resurgent Covid.. But for some it was just too much, their homes sequestered, their desperation easy for all to hear.. A few miles away, there was an organised protest, a bold stand as the lockdown takes hold in a country where you can be arrested for picking quarrels.. They're angry about a local school being turned into another quarantine facility. Police with riot shields forced them off the streets in the end.. This was on a small scale but it's a sign of anger and frustration as this lockdown goes on.. Meanwhile the Chinese government has sent teams to the city to help more than 660 companies in key sectors of the economy such as semiconductor and car manufacturing to resume production, reports state media.. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said on Friday they would ensure the supply of medical goods and the smooth flow of supply chains.. The move follows reports that parts of China's manufacturing sector might soon have to close, at least temporarily, because companies cannot get essential components from Shanghai.. He Xiaopeng, president of electrical vehicle manufacturer XPeng, said that if work did not start again in Shanghai during May, potentially all car factories across the country might have to stop operating.. China is one of the last remaining nations still committed to eradicating Covid, in contrast to most of the world which is trying to live with the virus.. But this zero-Covid policy has come under strain in recent weeks with the spread of the Omicron variant.. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.

The flashpoint site is deeply important to Muslims and Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount, and is at the heart of competing historical claims.. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have soared recently after deadly attacks in Israel and Palestinian deaths during subsequent Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank.. A 17-year-old Palestinian wounded on Thursday during an Israeli operation in the area of Jenin in the northern West Bank died on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said. . More than 20 Palestinians, many identified as gunmen, have been killed since Israel stepped up sweeps in the West Bank, centring on Jenin district, after a Palestinian killed three Israelis in Tel Aviv last Thursday. . That attack was the fourth in Israel by Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in just over two weeks. The killings have left 12 Israelis and two Ukrainians dead, marking the deadliest period of attacks in Israel for more than 15 years and leaving the country on edge.. Israeli police said dozens of Palestinians, some carrying flags of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, marched on the compound at about 04:00 (01:00 GMT) then started throwing stones and fireworks. . The police said they waited until Muslim Friday prayers had ended before entering the site to disperse the rioters, who had started throwing stones towards the Western Wall below the compound, where Jewish worshippers were.. The police tweeted video showing fireworks exploding inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and masked youths throwing stones towards officers. . Israel's foreign ministry tweeted video showing masked Palestinians inside the Qibli mosque (also known as al-Aqsa Mosque) throwing objects with the sound of a bang followed by a spray of sparks.. The foreign ministry denied reports on social media that police had entered the mosque building itself during the violence. Hours later footage from inside the mosque building showed Israeli police and Palestinians there with the scene more calm.. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned Israel's actions at the compound, saying it held it \"fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences\". . The clashes come after militant groups in Gaza called for \"hundreds of thousands\" of Palestinians to converge on the compound on Friday \"to protect our nation and our mosque\". . Last year Hamas, which governs Gaza, fired rockets towards Jerusalem following clashes at the mosque compound after weeks of unrest in the city, triggering a devastating 11-day war with Israel.. The compound is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and is also considered, in its entirety, as al-Aqsa Mosque. It is the third holiest site in Islam. . The same ground is sacred to Jews as the location of two biblical temples, and is the holiest site in Judaism. The question of rights there is one of the most contentious issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and between Israel and the wider Muslim world.. The recent surge in violence comes at a particularly volatile time, with the start of the Jewish festival of Passover on Friday night coinciding with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Christian festival of Easter.. Passover traditionally sees an increase in visits by religious Jews to the site, which are viewed by Palestinians as provocative.. This video can not be played.

NYPD acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that the cameras were not working at three stations during the attack because of what the department described as a technical issue..

        "content": "The warning came as Russia announced a missile strike on a military factory near Kyiv, which it claimed was in response to a Ukrainian helicopter attack on a Russian village.. Ukraine denies it carried out the attack. . \"Tonight, sea-based high precision long-range \"Kalibr\" missiles hit a military facility in the outskirts of Kyiv,\" Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.. The strike targeted Ukraine's Vizar military facility that was producing and repairing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile systems, Mr Konashenkov added, warning that Russia would intensify missile attacks on Kyiv if Ukraine continued what he described as attacks on Russian land.. He said: \"The number and scale of missile strikes against objects in Kyiv will increase in response to the commission of any attacks of a terrorist nature or sabotage on Russian territory by the Kyiv nationalist regime.\". Andrei Sizov, a 47-year-old owner of a wood workshop near the factory, told the AFP news agency that the blasts came overnight.. \"Around 1:30am, my security guard called me because there was an air strike,\" he said.. \"There were five hits. My employee was in the office and got thrown off his feet by the blast.\". He also said he believed Russia was taking revenge for the sinking of the Moskva warship, which Ukraine claims it hit with Neptune missiles.. On Thursday Russian officials accused Ukraine of sending two helicopters 10km (6 miles) into Russia's Bryansk region, bombing a residential building in the village of Klimovo and injuring eight people. . Kyiv denies the attack and accused Russia of staging the incident to stir up \"anti-Ukrainian hysteria\".. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims.. Russian forces started withdrawing in March from around the Ukrainian capital to focus on Russian efforts to seize eastern parts of the country, but Kyiv remains vulnerable to missile strikes.. In its statement the Russian defence ministry made no mention of . .. The military factory targeted in the strike produced anti-ship missiles, including some similar to the Neptune ones that Ukraine claims to have used to attack and sink the Moskva vessel.. The Russian account of the warship's sinking differs. Moscow defence officials claim an unexplained fire onboard caused ammunition to explode, ultimately causing the Moskva to \"lose its balance\" as it was being towed to port.. It is still not independently confirmed how the heavily-defended Black Sea flagship sank.. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story. Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle. Jude Law on becoming the wisest of all wizards, Professor Albus Dumbledore. ",

        "content": "The 510-crew missile cruiser was a symbol of Russia's military power, leading its naval assault on Ukraine.. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. Moscow has not reported any attack - it says the vessel sank after a fire.. The blaze caused the explosion of the warship's ammunition, Russia says, adding that the entire crew were later evacuated to nearby Russian vessels in the Black Sea. . After saying initially the warship was afloat, late on Thursday the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva had been lost.. The 12,490-tonne vessel is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. . \"While being towed... towards the destined port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,\" the Russian defence ministry said.. Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew.. The ship's sinking was described by the US as a \"big blow\", but American officials were unable to confirm whether Ukrainian Neptune missiles were responsible.. \"It's certainly plausible and possible that [Ukraine] did in fact hit this with a Neptune missile or maybe more,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said to CNN. . A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva.. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - . . . Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days.. This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his \"special military operation\" in Ukraine is going according to plan. . Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. . Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. . Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war.. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. . While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. . \"It's more about psychological damage than material damage,\" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC.. \"It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,\" he said. \"But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively.\". But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that \"Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure.\". The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. . The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this.. \"The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. . \"While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover.\". The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection.. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion. . Admiral Lord West, former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said that as well as being a military blow the vessel's loss was \"very embarrassing\".. \"This has a huge impact,\" Lord West said, speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM before confirmation that the Moskva had sunk. . \"Putin loves the navy. When he came into power, the first bit of the old Soviet forces that he put effort into was the navy. He's always had a soft spot for it.\". This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.

        "content": "\"The wonderful woman who cooked at our church and her son, who was in a wheelchair, were both killed when an artillery shell hit their apartment. I now know of several other of our parishioners who have died.\". Like most clergy in the region of north-eastern Ukraine where he is from, Father Pluzhnik belonged to the branch of the Russian Orthodox Church which takes its direction from its religious leadership in Moscow.. But now, he says, has applied to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - which was . , in a move never recognised by Russia. . He says many fellow priests who followed Patriarch Kirill in Moscow are doing the same because of the Church leader's stance on the war.  . Father Pluzhnik and his family fled under artillery fire and now have a temporary new home in the town of Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine.. \"When the war started, I was waiting to hear from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the 'father' of our church. But first there was no reaction at all, and then there was worse,\" he says.. \"Patriarch Kirill blessed the Russian army and gave his blessing to the war. It was not just him but the majority of priests of the Moscow Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church] including some that even have Ukrainian roots. I was in shock.\" . As well as having failed to unequivocally condemn the killing of innocent people in Ukraine, or call for a ceasefire, the Patriarch has held large televised services in Moscow to bless Russian troops. He has also suggested in sermons that the Kremlin's war is a righteous one about the future of Christianity.. \"What is happening today is much more important than politics,\" he said last month. \"We are talking about human salvation, about where humanity will end up and on which side of God the Saviour.\". There are religious undertones in much of the Kremlin's narrative justifying its invasion of Ukraine. It is a fight for the conservative ideals of the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow, against an immoral outside world. President Putin has said Ukraine is not only an \"inalienable part\" of Russia's history and culture - but also its \"spiritual space\".  . The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has said he finds Patriarch Kirill's sentiment concerning.. \"There are elements in the Russian Christian tradition that can become really toxic when they get in their head a particular kind of Christian nationalism, a sort of messianic approach to the fate of the nation,\" said Dr Williams during a visit to western Ukraine this week.. He was part of an extraordinary high-level, multi-faith delegation - including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist leaders. They met refugees who had fled the horrors in the eastern part of the country.. Dr Williams has long studied and written about the positive contribution of the Russian Orthodox Church, and appears deeply saddened by the role the Moscow Patriarchate is playing in the war.. \"I think that the increasing influence in the Patriarchate of Moscow of ultranationalist ideals - often including a strand of anti-Semitism - has been going on for some time. . \"And it has now expressed itself in this very uncritical support of Russian national ambitions, a very aggressive attitude towards many other Orthodox churches. The writing has been on the wall for some time,\" he said.. Patriarch Kirill has echoed President Putin's claim that Russian speakers and followers of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church living in eastern Ukraine need liberating after years of oppression.. \"Our brothers and sisters were really suffering, they suffer for their loyalty to the Church,\" said Patriarch Kirill a week into the war.. But Father Pluzhnik, a Russian speaker and a follower of the Moscow Patriarchate all of his adult life, is angered by those claims.. \"When I hear them say they are protecting us and fighting some 'Holy War', I think they are either blind, or they are not serving God but the devil,\" he says.. \"We were living peacefully until they came. But far from protecting us they bombed and tortured and killed. Before the war, parishioners were completely free to choose what church they went to, they just went to the church closest to their home. For many of them it was not even a significant difference to go to a church that followed Moscow or not, they just wanted to pray to God. Now that has changed.\" . Dr Sergii Bortnyk, a professor at the Kyiv Theological Academy and an adviser to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, acknowledges that there has been a widespread movement of people and parishes across the country abandoning their loyalty to Moscow.. \"I think it is maybe half of the 12,000 parishes [of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine] that have said that they want to break away now,\" says Dr Bortnyk.. \"Patriarch Kirill has not said anything about all the Christians in Ukraine that have been killed, so I believe the members of our church are free to end their connection to him as the patriarch,\" he says.. \"The connection to all of our [Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox] Church in Ukraine to Moscow is in question now.\". The Kremlin's aim, backed by the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, had been to unite Russia and Ukraine in a single \"spiritual space\".. But the manner by which they have tried to achieve that appears to have had precisely the opposite effect.. ",
