Latavia Washington McGee is recovering at the hospital with no injuries while Eric Williams is at a Texas hospital to undergo surgery for three gunshot wounds in his leg, his wife told CNN. . Michelle Williams said the news her husband was alive brought relief to her and their 11-year-old son, she told local ABC affiliate WBTW. . \"My heart is breaking for the other two families that don't get to say the same,\" she said. . Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown died after unidentified gunmen opened fire as the group of four drove a white minivan on 3 March through Matamoros, a city of 500,000 people located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville. . A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander more than one block away, was killed in last Friday's incident.. The group had travelled from South Carolina and crossed the border into Mexico because Ms McGee had an appointment for a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat, her relatives said.. The four Americans were found at a wooden shack outside Matamoros after being transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday \"to create confusion\", Mexican officials said on Tuesday. . They were brought back under armed escort by a heavily armed Mexican military convoy.. Ms Williams said her husband Eric Williams was emotional as he spoke to her on the phone as he had considered Brown and Woodard to be like his \"brothers\".. Ms McGee was also emotional, crying on the phone to her mother, Barbara Burgess, who told local CNN affiliate WPDE her daughter \"watched two of them die\" right \"in front of her\". . This video can not be played. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. A video of the kidnapping shows the four Americans being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men.

Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US state department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".. Mexico is one of the top destinations worldwide for medical tourism. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Protesters face tear gas and water cannons - as MPs brawl in parliament - over a \"Russian-style\" bill. The new law would class non-government and media groups as \"foreign agents\" if they get more than 20% of their funding from abroad.. Police arrested 66 people overnight, including a Georgian opposition leader.. Zurab Japaridze suffered a serious injury after he was detained.. A public official who visited Mr Japaridze in detention said he had been hit by a baton during the arrest. . Authorities said 55 police were hurt when stones and petrol bombs were thrown at them. Some of the most arresting images of the night came when water cannon was sprayed at protesters waving EU flags. . Riot police eventually moved in to clear protesters from Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament.. Crowds grew outside parliament again on Wednesday, as protesters sought to challenge the draft \"foreign agents\" law. Some 10,000 people had turned out by late afternoon and another 10 people were arrested.. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili denounced the \"stir\" over the draft law, which went through its first reading inside parliament on Tuesday. Ruling party Georgian Dream maintains the legislation dates back to US legislation in the 1930s. The same argument was used by Russia after it passed a similar law in 2012.. Russia's law has since been expanded to suppress Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers. Anyone identified as a foreign agent now has to highlight a foreign-agent label on their publication.. Many of the protesters in the centre of Tbilisi were students. \"We think that our government is under Russian influence and it's very bad for our future,\" said Lizzie.. Opposition-supporting TV stations have also dubbed the proposed legislation as a \"Russian law\". . Georgia has applied to the European Union for candidate status and also aims to join Nato, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Another student, Lia Chagovadze, said she and her friends were there to fight for Western values and freedom, while Nanuka Shakinovi said the protesters would not allow the government to stop Georgia's push to join the EU: \"We are going to fight them and we will not stop until we win.\". \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old Luka Kimeridze.. Georgian Dream chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said criticism of the draft law as similar to Russia's own repressive legislation was misleading. \"In the end, the stir will die out and the public will have transparency in the funding of NGOs,\" he said.. However, Eka Gigauri of Transparency International told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Political tensions in Georgia have been heightened by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seen by many Georgians as a war of aggression by Moscow, and many thousands of Russians have fled there. However, the government in Tbilisi has adopted a neutral stance, refusing to openly back Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia.. Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". She has vowed to veto the legislation, but Georgian Dream has enough votes to override the president's veto in parliament. The party has applied to the Council of Europe for its opinion.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote in parliament as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\", while the chairman of Georgian Dream condemned the embassy's comment as \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . US state department spokesman Ned Price warned that the new law would \"strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\".. Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. ",

In . , Ukrainian athletes representing several sports appear one-by-one saying \"Glory to the Heroes!\".

On Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information. . However, there is some doubt over his identity, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.. Ukraine's authorities have said the killing is \"another proof this war is genocidal\" and launched a criminal investigation, vowing to hunt down the perpetrators.. Russia has not publicly commented on the video.. Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes - including torture, rape and murder - since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion. Russia denies the allegations.. Last July, a video emerged that showed another captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. There have also been accusations against Ukrainian forces, with Moscow accusing soldiers of executing a group of Russian prisoners in November.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "They were among nine people and three institutions sanctioned over sexual and gender-based violence, to coincide with International Women's Day on Wednesday.. Others included Taliban ministers and officials from South Sudan and Myanmar.. A BBC Eye investigation detailed .  who had been physically abused by him when they were detained in March 2022. . Alexander Fedorinov was identified by the BBC using facial recognition software.. Announcing the sanctions in a statement, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Police Josep Borrell said the EU was moving \"from words to action\" in its commitment to \"eliminate all forms of violence of violence against women\".. He said the sanctions were \"enhancing efforts to counter sexual and gender-based violence, to ensure that those responsible are fully accountable for their actions, and to combat impunity\".. The two Moscow police officers were sanctioned for their role in \"arbitrary arrests and detentions as well as torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in the context of the censorship and oppression led by the Russian authorities\".. On 6 March last year, a group of anti-war protesters were arrested and taken to Moscow's Brateyevo police station. There, at least 11 detainees - mostly young women - were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of a plainclothes police officer. . The officer didn't give his name, and there was no record of him on any police websites. The protesters felt they had little chance in identifying their abuser, who they called the \"man in black\".. That was until a huge data leak from the popular Russian food delivery app, Yandex Food, provided the breakthrough they needed.. Anastasia - who says she had been suffocated with a plastic bag by the \"man in black\" - trawled through the data and found only nine users who had ordered food to Brateyevo police station. Working with the other victims, she searched the names and phone numbers included in the leak, looking for pictures she recognised. . Finally she came across a face that was imprinted in her memory - it was the \"man in black\" and his name was Ivan Ryabov. . Anastasia also wanted to identify another officer who was present that evening and refused to give his name. The detainees had called him the \"man in beige\".. Although he wasn't involved in the abuse of protesters, Anastasia felt he was somehow in charge. \"All communication took place through him,\" she said. . Using facial recognition on a short video captured inside the police station, the BBC was able to name the man as Alexander Fedorinov. At that time, he was the acting head of the Brateyevo police department. . Despite appeals mentioning Ryabov and Fedorinov, sent to Russian authorities from victims and a Moscow politician, there was no evidence that either of the men had faced any repercussions inside Russia. The BBC did not receive a response after contacting the two men for comment in August 2022. . But as of 7 March 2023, both men are now subject to an asset freeze and travel ban within the EU.. Anastasia told the BBC that the year since her arrest has not been easy. \"But Ryabov's inclusion on the sanctions list only strengthens my belief that I did and said the right thing,\" she said.. Anastasia has left Russia and says she is happy to be in a country where she isn't afraid to share her anti-war views on social media.. Ivan Ryabov and Alexander Fedorinov were sanctioned alongside two acting Taliban ministers - Neda Mohammad Nadeem and Muhammad Khalid Hanafi - responsible for the decrees which banned women from higher education in Afghanistan. . This video can not be played. Listen to the “man in black” shouting insults at Marina and Alexandra. The list also included high-ranking members of the Russian armed forces whose units systematically participated in acts of sexual and gender-based violence in Ukraine in March and April last year.. It also named two South Sudanese officials, who according to the EU had commanded government militias which used sexual violence as a tactic of war and a reward for the men under their command.. And the EU also sanctioned Major-General Toe Ui, Myanmar's deputy minister of home affairs, along with the country's Office of the Chief of Military Security Affairs (OCMSA), where he was formerly second-in-command. OCMSA is accused of using sexual violence and torture against men, women and members of the LGBT community.. The other institutions sanctioned were Qarchak Prison in Iran, where pro-democracy protestors have been detained, and the Syrian Republican Guard, which is accused of using widespread sexual and gender-based violence to repress and intimidate the Syrian people.. BBC Eye Investigations tells the story of how these young Russian women came together to expose the identity of their torturer and his commanding officer.. ",
