Starbucks currently has around 20 stores in the country.. \"Now, there's going to be people who say, olive oil in coffee? But the proof is in the cup,\" . .. \"In over 40 years, I can't remember a moment in time where I've been more excited, more enthused,\" he added.. The firm plans to bring the selection of hot and iced drinks to stores in Southern California in the US this spring. The UK, Middle East and Japan are set to follow later this year.. The Oleato range, which will be launched on Wednesday in Italy, features an iced shaken espresso and a latte with olive oil \"steamed with oat milk\".. There will also be a cold brew coffee in which \"a silky infusion of Partanna extra virgin oil with vanilla sweet cream foam... slowly cascades through the beverage\".. Olive oil is a key part of the Mediterranean diet, associated with countries including Italy, Greece and Spain.. Its health benefits can partly be attributed to its monounsaturated fatty acids, which contain vitamins and minerals, and polyphenols, that are micronutrients derived from plants.. The term \"drink olive oil\" trended on video-sharing platform TikTok last year, with supporters saying it had anti-inflammatory properties..  when it announced plans to open its first store in the country in 2018.. At that time, Mr Schultz said: \"We are not coming to teach Italians how to make coffee. We're coming here with humility and respect, to show what we've learned.\".

Judge George Daniels said he was \"constitutionally restrained\" from approving access to the funds, which are frozen in the US, as this would amount to a ruling that the Taliban were Afghanistan's legitimate government. . He noted that the Biden administration did not recognise the Taliban, which meant US courts did not have the power to do so either.. \"The judgment creditors are entitled to collect on their default judgments and be made whole for the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history, but they cannot do so with the funds of the central bank of Afghanistan,\" Judge Daniels wrote in his 30-page judgement.. \"The Taliban, not the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or the Afghan people, must pay for the Taliban's liability in the 9/11 attacks,\" he added.. The Taliban were removed from power by a US-led military coalition in 2001, but retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 after Western forces withdrew from the country.. Al-Qaeda, an Islamist extremist network, planned the 11 September attacks from Afghanistan before planes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in northern Virginia, with a fourth jet crashing into a field in Pennsylvania.. The judge's ruling is a defeat for those who had claimed some of the $7bn of Afghanistan's central bank funds frozen at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.. \"This decision deprives over 10,000 members of the 9/11 community of their right to collect compensation from the Taliban,\" said Lee Wolosky, a lawyer who argued for victims' compensation. \"We believe it is wrongly decided and will appeal.\".

It shows the threat posed by foreign spies is at an all-time high, he added.. While delivering his annual threat assessment in Canberra, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) chief outlined a \"concerted campaign\" to infiltrate the Australian media to shape reporting and gain information on sources.. A \"lackey\" planned to offer journalists all-expenses-paid study tours of a foreign country, he said, where spies with the \"home-ground advantage\" would seek to gain information to leverage.. And Mr Burgess also detailed thwarted plots from two different countries to physically harm Australian residents - a week after the government revealed that an Iranian plot targeting a dissident in Australia had been disrupted.. He again did not name the countries, but said the targets were critics of foreign regimes.. \"In one case, the intelligence service started monitoring a human rights activist and plotted to lure the target offshore, where the individual could be - quote - 'disposed of',\" he said.. \"In another, a lackey was dispatched to locate specific dissidents and - quote - 'deal with them'.\". Mr Burgess said Asio had weeded out the spies after an \"intense and sustained\" campaign.. \"They were good - but Asio was better... working with our partners, we removed them. The hive is history,\" he said.. But the threat posed by foreign intelligence has been worsening, Mr Burgess said, particularly since Australia signed the Aukus security agreement with the US and the UK.. \"Asio is... busier than any time in our 74-year history. Busier than the Cold War, busier than 9/11, busier than the height of the caliphate.\". \"From where I sit, it looks like hand-to-hand combat.\". Mr Burgess also used the speech to criticise thousands of \"reckless\" Australians advertising their security clearances on social media networking sites, as well as former Australian defence personnel involved in foreign military training programmes.. \"It is critical our allies know we can keep our secrets, and keep their secrets,\" Mr Burgess said..

Tuesday's proposed measure is the toughest to curtail immigration yet introduced by Mr Biden, a Democrat who came into office promising a more humane approach to the border crisis than the administration of his predecessor. . The proposed rule would only apply to adults and families, but not to unaccompanied children. . Under the plan, migrants would have to use a phone app to make an appointment to speak with a US immigration official when they arrive at the border. . Those who failed to make the appointment would be presumed to have been found ineligible for asylum in the other countries they passed through. . The proposal - issued jointly by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice - allows for those undocumented migrants to be swiftly deported. . If approved, it would be enacted on 11 May, when Title 42 - a Trump-era health emergency provision allowing migrants to be expelled back to Mexico - is due to expire. . The Biden policy would remain in place for two years with the option of extending it. . The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would sue to block the rule from ever taking effect.. The organisation compared the plan to actions previously taken by former President Donald Trump that were ruled unconstitutional in the courts. . Oxfam America said: \"This sweeping asylum ban will shut the door to countless refugees seeking safety and protection in the United States.\" . But an unnamed Biden administration official told AFP news agency: \"This administration will not allow mass chaos and disorder at the border because of Congress's failure to act.\".

        "content": "Putin won't surrender easily, says US diplomat John Sullivan. John Sullivan was America's man in Moscow in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. . The former US ambassador is the one who had conversations with Russian officials about trying to prevent a war, but \"there was no engagement\", he said. . \"They demanded security guarantees for Russia but wouldn't talk constructively about security for Ukraine. They never moved beyond their talking points… it was a charade.\" . When I ask whether the US should work harder at continuing those conversations to try to end the conflict, he tells me that President Vladimir Putin \"wasn't interested in negotiating before the war. He's still not interested in negotiating\". . Instead, the Biden administration has focused on rallying global support for arming Ukraine and sanctioning Russia, itself shipping billions of dollars of weapons to the country. . In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Putin repeated his view that the West had started the war, that it was using Ukraine to try to inflict a \"strategic defeat\" on Moscow, and that Russia, not Ukraine, was fighting for its very existence. . Despite the failures of Moscow's self-declared special military operation, Mr Sullivan says the goals initially declared by the Kremlin remain the same - to \"de-Nazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine. He interprets that as \"removing the government in Kyiv and subjugating the Ukrainian people\".. This is part of a vision that President Putin has outlined to re-gather the Russian peoples that were separated by the collapse of the Soviet Union. . \"He can't have a democratically elected government, particularly one led by President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, in Kyiv,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He will never be satisfied as long as that government exists because he considers it a threat to Russia and to his vision of this larger Russian state he's trying to create.\"  . So what, then, would it take for Mr Putin to stop the war? . \"He has to be convinced that he can't win,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He's going to double down until he's convinced that there's just no way he can win. I'm not sure how significant the battlefield setbacks have to be for him to reach that point, but he's nowhere near that today.\" . This video can not be played. Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. Mr Sullivan says the Russian leader has a long-time horizon, and \"a vision for what he wants to accomplish that he will not surrender easily\". . Neither, though, will the Ukrainians, Mr Sullivan believes, declaring one of the strategic failures of Mr Putin's war to be alienating the Slavic nation of 44 million people.. \"The Ukrainian people aren't going to forgive and forget,\" he says. \"Even if President Zelenksy wanted to end the war, wanted to make territorial concessions, basically wanted to surrender, the Ukrainian people wouldn't let him.\" . With such a military, political and ideological standoff, the US has to be prepared for a long war. . President Joe Biden underlined America's commitment by making a surprise visit to Kyiv on the anniversary of the invasion, but Mr Sullivan does not expect the conflict to end this year. . \"Beyond that I don't know,\" he says. \"But [Mr Putin] doesn't want an off-ramp. The goals of this special military operation will be achieved. He says that all the time.\" . ",

        "content": " and sanctions have worsened the situation in recent years.. Top officials are expected to meet at the end of February to discuss a \"fundamental change\" to agriculture policy, state media has said.. This is a \"very important and urgent task\" amid \"pressing\" farming issues, news aggregator KCNA Watch reported.. The news comes as Pyongyang continues . . . South Korea's unification ministry has reportedly also sounded the alarm on the food shortages and asked the World Food Programme (WFP) for help.. Satellite imagery from South Korean authorities shows that the North produced 180,000 tonnes less food in 2022 than in 2021.. In June, the WFP raised concerns that extreme weather conditions like drought and flooding could reduce production of both winter and spring crops. State media also reported late last year that the country was experiencing its \"second worst\" drought on record. . As forecasted, food prices have risen this year amid poor harvests and people have been turning to inexpensive alternatives, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, who works with North Korea-centred publication 38North.org. . The price of corn has risen 20% at the start of 2023, with growing demand for the less preferred - compared to rice - but more affordable staple, reported Rimjin-gang, a North Korean magazine based in Japan. . \"If people are buying more corn it means food overall is getting more expensive, and staple foods like rice in particular,\" Mr Silberstein said. A kilogram of the crop now costs about 3,400 North Korean won (£3.10; $3.80). . North Korea is ranked one of the poorest countries in the world. Recent estimates are scarce, but CIA World Factbook estimates its gross domestic product per capita to be around $1,700 in 2015.. That said, the actual situation and numbers are unclear, given North Korea's opaque economy.. \"Due to North Korea's strict Covid border measures on goods and people, there's no way for any outsiders to go into the country and check for themselves what the situation is,\" said James Fretwell, an analyst at NK News.. These measures have also made it difficult for organisations outside North Korea to send help in times of crisis, he added.. North Korea has also strictly restricted cross-border trade and traffic since January 2020. . Sokeel Park, South Korea country director in non-profit Liberty in North Korea (Link), described the regime's response to the pandemic as \"extreme and paranoid\".. Mr Park, whose organisation helps resettle North Korean refugees in South Korea or the US, said the supply of basic necessities in the North has been dwindling since the start of the pandemic. Link has heard multiple credible reports of people starving to death, Mr Park said.. The country has also seen a significant decline in humanitarian aid from the international community - the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said North Korea received $2.3m (£1.9m) from international organisations and other agencies last year, down from $14m in 2021.. While this may be a result of prolonged border closures, some relief workers told the BBC that international sanctions, which have tightened in response to North Korea's military provocations, have also hindered the delivery of humanitarian supplies.. Still, there are some signs that cross-border economic activity is starting again. Nikkei Asia reported last week that some truck travel with China, which accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade, has resumed.. But that does not necessarily mean standards of living will improve for ordinary North Koreans.. Mr Park said the regime has focused its resources on its missile prowess and propaganda, at high social costs. Pyongyang fired a record number of ballistic missiles last year - more than 70, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, which can potentially reach the US mainland. Early this month, . .. \".  for ordinary North Korean people, but continues to prioritise propaganda and pageantry for the Kim family, missile launches, and strict controls [on] the population,\" Mr Park added.. Experts worry that the situation on the ground will deteriorate further, leading to a famine as devastating as the one the country experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s, often known in official documents as the \"Arduous March\". Estimates put the number of deaths between 600,000 to a million.. \"We don't seem to be near the levels of the 1990s famine,\" Mr Silberstein said. \"But margins are razor thin. So even a slightly lessened supply of food could potentially have dire consequences.\" . ",
