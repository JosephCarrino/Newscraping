        "content": "It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter sends video from scene of fatal crash. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke after visiting the site of Tuesday night's head-on collision between a passenger service and a freight train. . The local stationmaster has been charged with manslaughter. The Greek transport minister has resigned.. Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors.. The accident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. The passenger train carrying some 350 people collided with a freight train as it emerged from a tunnel after leaving the town of Larissa.. It is still unclear why the two services were running on the same track.. The stationmaster, who is in charge of signalling, denies wrongdoing and has blamed the accident on a possible technical failure.. After visiting the site, Mr Mitsotakis said everything pointed to \"a tragic human error\".. \"Justice will do its job,\" he said in a televised address. \"People will be held accountable, while the state will be on the side of the people.\" . Announcing his resignation, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated: \"When something so tragic happens, it is impossible to continue and pretend it didn't happen.\" . Trade unions said collisions have multiple factors and the crash had highlighted chronic deficiencies, including lack of staff, broken signals and outdated facilities.. The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed and the first two caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\", Thessaly regional governor Kostas Agorastos said.. The train was travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki, which has a sizeable student population, and it is believed many on board were students returning there after a holiday for Greek Orthodox lent.. Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\".. Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage, told Reuters news agency: \"The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Larissa's mayor said some of those who died would only be identifiable through genetic testing.. Relatives of missing passengers have provided DNA samples to help the identify bodies, a hospital in Larissa said. . ",

        "content": "Jurors earlier in the day visited the sprawling, 1,700-acre hunting lodge to assess the crime scene.. The disbarred attorney denies involvement in the 7 June 2021 deaths.. Mr Murdaugh reported finding the bodies of his wife and son near the dog kennels on the property in South Carolina's Colleton County. . Over several hours on Wednesday afternoon, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters painstakingly led jurors through the state's theory.. At the time of the murders, Mr Waters said, a \"gathering storm\" was threatening to expose Mr Murdaugh's decade of financial crimes - crimes that Mr Murdaugh himself has admitted in court. . The murders of Maggie and Paul, Mr Waters said, were Mr Murdaugh's desperate attempt to gain sympathy and delay looming inquiries into his theft of millions of dollars.. The state's case has been limited by a lack of physical evidence - the murder weapons were not found, there were no eyewitnesses and no blood found on Mr Murdaugh's clothing. . But Mr Waters on Wednesday emphasised that Mr Murdaugh was with his wife and son just minutes before the killings, something the defendant had denied for 20 months before acknowledging it last week in court. . \"After an exhaustive investigation, there is only one person who had the motive, who had the means, who had the opportunity to commit these crimes, and also whose guilty conduct after these crimes betrays him,\" Mr Waters said.. The defence will present their closing arguments on Thursday. . Earlier this week, Mr Murdaugh's lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, asked Judge Clifton Newman to grant jurors time to visit the 1,700-acre estate, known as Moselle, to get a better idea of where the bodies were found relative to the kennels and the Murdaugh home, where Mr Murdaugh originally said he had been napping at the time of the killings.. \"You just can't really appreciate the spatial issues without really seeing them,\" Mr Harpootlian told the court on Monday. . Prosecutors, however, argued against granting jurors access to the estate, saying that the property has changed in the 20 months since the killings. . They said that some of the trees between the kennels and the Murdaugh home have grown taller and thicker.. Only the judge, members of the jury, police and security personnel were present for the visit, but members of the trial's media pool also paid a brief visit to the property on Wednesday morning.. \"It is a heavy place to visit,\" the Wall Street Journal's Valerie Bauerlein wrote in a pool report. \"The property has stood vacant for 20 months and the grass is high.\". After seeing the kennels, a nearby shed and feed room, she observed: \"There was no visible sign that two people had died in a violent manner in such close proximity, no blood stain or anything similar to it.\". Moselle is where the family lived for several years. It includes their home, as well as dog kennels, a cabin and sprawling lands, fields and forests, where Mr Murdaugh would hunt with his two sons.. The estate is now listed under contract at $3.9m (£3.9m), . .. Mr Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster, testified that much of the estate is \"really not even accessible\" because it is filled with swamps and there are no built roadways in many parts.. If convicted, Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years in jail, though prosecutors have argued for a life sentence.. This video can not be played. Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial. ",

        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. At least 38 people died and dozens more were injured in the head-on collision between two trains near the city of Larissa on Tuesday night.. The front carriages of a passenger train involved were mostly destroyed.. \"We heard a big bang,\" said 28-year-old passenger Stergios Minenis, who jumped to safety from the wreckage.. \"We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. . \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\". The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames, shortly before midnight local time. . It is being described as the worst train crash Greece has ever seen.. An investigation has been launched and police say they have arrested a local station master in Larissa. . Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming - some people were afraid they were going to die.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\". . Another told Skai television he was lucky to escape his carriage \"fairly quickly\", but \"in other wagons, they did not manage to get out, and one wagon even caught fire\".. Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Angelos Tsiamouras told Greek broadcaster ERT the crash had felt like an earthquake, and he smashed the train window using his suitcase. \"We broke the windows with our backs,\" another unnamed passenger said. . One survivor, Lazos, told the newspaper Protothema: \"I wasn't hurt, but I was stained with blood from other people who were injured near me.\". Many of the 350 passengers on board the passenger train were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis said the exact number of dead is still unclear, amid reports there are 20-25 people still missing. However, officials say some may have left the scene without being accounted for.. Mr Karamanlis later resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage reached 1,300C (2,370F), which \"makes it hard to identify the people who were inside\".. One woman told Greek channel ANT1 her 23-year-old cousin, who was speaking to his mother on the phone from the passenger train shortly before the line cut, is still missing. . \"His mother has been looking for him since dawn,\" she added.. Sixty-six people were being treated in hospital for their injuries, including six admitted to intensive care.. This video can not be played. It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter at scene of fatal crash. \"It was a very powerful collision,\" the regional governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, told state-run television.. He said the first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two carriages caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\".. \"They were travelling at great speed and one (driver) didn't know the other was coming,\" the governor added.. As daylight broke, dozens of rescue workers aided with cranes were lifting the charred remains of the derailed carriages to search for more victims. . \"I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It's tragic. Five hours later, we are finding bodies,\" an exhausted rescuer emerging from the wreckage told AFP news agency. . Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who visited the disaster scene on Wednesday, has vowed to find out what happened and ensure it never happens again.. Police say they have charged the 59-year-old station master for the city of Larissa with causing deaths by negligence and grievous bodily harm by negligence. The station master, who is in charge of signalling, has denied both charges and blamed the accident on a technical fault.. Three days of national mourning have been declared. .

        "content": "Mr Lukashenko said his country \"fully supports\" a Beijing plan for ending the war in Ukraine.. China . , calling for the respect of national sovereignty.. The visit comes days after China sent its top diplomat . . . Mr Lukashenko and Mr Xi's meeting also coincided with a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Central Asian nations to discuss the Ukraine war.. On Wednesday, China and Belarus \"expressed deep concern\" about the conflict and \"extreme interest in the soonest possible establishment of peace in Ukraine\", the Belarus state-run news agency Belta reported.. Mr Lukashenko has aided the Russian leader in his war in Ukraine, and observers have seen his trip to Beijing as another sign of China closing ranks with Russia and its allies.. The Belarus leader praised China's peace plan.. The 12-point document urges respect for \"the sovereignty of all countries\". It does not specifically say Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", an implicit criticism of Ukraine's Western allies.. Mr Lukashenko said he \"fully supports the initiative on international security you have put forward\", according to remarks released by his aides.. Political decisions \"should be aimed at first and foremost preventing a slide into a global confrontation that will see no winners\", he told Mr Xi.. China's peace plan was met with general distrust in the West.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed with some parts of it and said it was a sign of China's willingness to engage. Beijing has so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit. . The Chinese leader called for discarding \"all Cold War mentality\", according to a Chinese readout of the meeting with Mr Lukashenko.. Mr Xi added that countries \"should stop politicising\" the world economy and to \"do things that will aid a ceasefire, cessation of war, and a peaceful resolution\".. Mr Lukashenko's three-day visit comes after China upgraded the status of its relationship with Belarus in September, several months into the Ukraine war.. Chinese foreign ministry statements have described their ties as an \"all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership\", a rare term that has been used for only one other country - Pakistan.. This means Belarus ranks very highly in China's hierarchy of international relationships, just below Russia, according to a BBC Monitoring analysis. . Belarus has been a key ally for Russia from the very beginning of the conflict when it allowed Moscow to use the Belarusian border with Ukraine as a launchpad for an attack on Kyiv, which eventually failed.. China, meanwhile, has attempted to appear neutral by stating support for both sovereignty and the right to national security, which are Ukraine and Russia's respective interests.. But Beijing has also refused to condemn Moscow and supported their war effort in indirect ways. Chinese state media has actively propagated Russian's view on the war, according to multiple analyses. . The Chinese government .  that it was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. . \"We do not accept the United States' finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about the allegations.. Chinese firms are also accused of supplying dual-use technology - goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as drones and semi-conductor chips - to Russia.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. Wednesday's visit took place as the US made its own diplomatic push, with Mr Blinken touring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In a speech in Uzbekistan, he noted the war had \"fostered deep concern across the region\" and stressed the US' commitment to sovereignty.. \"After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbour by force, what's to stop it from doing the same to others? Countries across Central Asia understand this,\" he said.. All five Central Asian countries are former members of the Soviet Union who have trade ties with Russia and China. But they have largely remained neutral during the war, adhered to Western sanctions and expressed unease at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also an ex-Soviet state.. ",

The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",
