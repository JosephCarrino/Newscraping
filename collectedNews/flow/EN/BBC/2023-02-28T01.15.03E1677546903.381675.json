        "content": "Watch: West Bank town set alight after Israelis killed. The man was killed in an attack on vehicles on a highway near the city of Jericho.. The shooting happened after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian villages .  with dozens of cars and houses burned.. That attack came after two settlers, from a nearby village, were shot dead by a Palestinian on Sunday.. The Israeli-American man killed near Jericho was taken by paramedics to a hospital in Jerusalem, but was later pronounced dead. . US Ambassador Tom Nides .  \"Sadly, I can confirm that a US citizen was killed in one of the terror attacks in the West Bank tonight. I pray for his family.\". The Israeli Defence Forces said attackers opened fire on Israeli vehicles on three occasions, and later set their own vehicles on fire.. There was an exchange of fire with police before the attackers fled, the IDF tweeted.. There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any Palestinian groups. . Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip but is less prominent in the West Bank, said the attack was a natural response to Israeli attacks.. \"The crimes conducted by the occupation and the herds of settlers will not be met but with stabbing, shooting and car ramming,\" a spokesman said in a statement.. The violence came after Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a . Videos posted hours after the summit ended on Sunday showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara on Sunday night. . This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\".. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis.. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don't take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement.. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles south of Nablus.. The brothers were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times.. No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions' Den.. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in .  in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005.. Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians.. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 14 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. More than 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. . Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.. ",

        "content": "Ecuador has become one of the main transit countries for cocaine produced in neighbouring Peru and Colombia. . Last year, more than 200 tonnes of the drug were seized in the Andean country, much of it in the port of Guayaquil.. With Ecuador the world's largest exporter of bananas, smugglers often try to hide their illegal consignments among the fruit which is shipped from Guayaquil to destinations all over the globe. . This latest haul was found inside a container full of banana cases destined for Belgium.. The seizure coincides with a visit by Belgium's Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson to Ecuador and Colombia.. The two officials want to strengthen cooperation with the two South American nations in the fight against drug trafficking.. Belgium has become the country where the largest quantities of cocaine have been seized within the European Union in recent years, with the port of Antwerp the main entry point for the illegal drug.. The director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Alexis Gosdeel, said earlier this month that the \"growing flow of cocaine now threatens the entire European Union\". . \"I am deeply concerned that the expanding EU cocaine market is bringing a rise in violence and corruption on public institutions and governance,\" he warned. . In Ecuador, violence linked to drug smuggling has skyrocketed as powerful Mexican cartels have infiltrated local gangs to gain control of the lucrative business.. Prisons are overflowing and fights between rival gangs behind bars have left scores dead.. ",

        "content": "This is the first national election where an electronic device has been used to accredit voters.. The election commission has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. The PDP representative at the election centre in Abuja described the process as fraudulent, and accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec, while the Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC, whose candidate Bola Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. With about a third of the 36 states officially declared, Mr Tinubu has 44% of votes cast, ahead of Mr Abubakar on 33%, and Mr Obi on 18%. However, many of the results yet to come are from the north and south-east, seen as strongholds of the PDP and Labour Party respectively, so the final outcome remains unpredictable.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 but this time, Mr Obi from the previously little known Labour Party is expected to mount a strong challenge to the two-party system. He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. Mr Obi has caused a major upset by winning in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, narrowly defeating Mr Tinubu in his heartland.. Mr Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and hopes to use his record there as the basis of his presidential bid.. The ruling party candidate has accepted defeat in Lagos and said that as a democrat, he was bound to accept the outcome of any election.. \"People have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice,\" he said in a statement released by his campaign team.. He also appealed for calm from his supporters after his loss, following reports of violence in parts of Lagos against traders from the Igbo community, like Mr Obi.. Mr Obi's victory in Lagos, though a major breakthrough for a third-party candidate, is not necessarily a huge surprise. The city is home to many young, educated people, as well as a large Igbo population - all groups widely seen as backing his campaign.. He has also won in his heartland eastern Enugu state.. Inec had assured Nigerians that the electronic voting system, known as Bvas, would enable it to transmit election results direct from polling stations to improve transparency.. However, there were complaints on Saturday from many voters that electoral officials refused to upload the results at the polling stations as they are supposed to.. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results.. Inec chairman Mr Yakubu has apologised for the inability of the commission to upload most of the results as promised, saying that a surge in traffic caused glitches.. ",

Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. The airline said: \"Safety of the passengers and crew remain Wizz Air's number one priority.... \"Following the recent developments in Moldova and the elevated, but not imminent, risk in the country's airspace, Wizz Air has made the difficult but responsible decision to suspend all flights to Chisinau from 14 March.\". Moldova's civil aviation authority said the airline had sought approval for its summer flight schedule on 14 February, and the agency \"determined that flights in the national airspace can be carried out safely by following a number of procedures\". . The authority said it would take \"all necessary actions\" to return Wizz Air to Chisinau airport as soon as possible, and to attract other low-cost airlines..

The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed.. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova..

She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\".. Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry has alleged, with no evidence, that Ukrainian saboteurs dressed as Russian troops would attack from Transnistria, to provide a pretext for a Ukrainian invasion..
