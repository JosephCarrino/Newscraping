        "content": "\"It's unbelievable but true,\" he said. \"We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.\". Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.. Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.. Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.. \"Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,\" the 70-year-old leader said. \"We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.\" . Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments, but did tell reporters that \"as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond\". . Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, the World War Two conflict which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops and turn the tide of the war.. Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of World War Two. . Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he claims are leading the Kyiv government. . And he returned to the theme throughout his speech. . \"Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,\" he said. . \"Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West.\". But he vowed that while it was \"unbelievable but true\" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it. . Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the occasion, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled. . Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33. . The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated 5 million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria. . Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle.. Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade. . As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion. . Local media reported that regional Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president. . Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take \"revenge\" against the West for aiding Ukraine. . \"Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,\" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv. . Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was \"increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions\" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy. . Later, addressing the National Prayer Breakfast in the US via videolink, Mr Zelensky thanked President Biden for his support and set Ukrainian forces a goal of defeating the Russian invasion in the next year. . \"We must do everything we can together so that next year - on the first Thursday of February - we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil,\" Mr Zelensky said. .

While Messina Denaro was the \"boss of bosses\" for Sicily's notorious Cosa Nostra, Greco was part of the 'Ndrangheta organised crime mob who originate from the Calabria region in Italy's deep south.. The 'Ndrangheta are now the most powerful mafia in Italy and their tentacles stretch across Europe and South America.. Greco, 63, was wanted for the murder of two brothers during a \"mafia war\" between two gangs in the early 1990s.. Stefano and Giuseppe Bartolomeo were beaten to death at a fishmonger's in the small town of Cosenza in January 1991. Their bodies were never found and are believed to have been dissolved in acid. . Greco was part of a rival gang and he was also accused of the attempted murder of another man later that year in the same town.. When a trial judge issued an arrest warrant for him in 2006, Greco went on the run. . Eight years later, he settled in the French city of Saint-Étienne, south-west of Lyon, eventually taking up the job of pizzaiolo in an Italian restaurant.. Greco took on a new identity, calling himself Paolo Dimitrio. By now he had been given a life sentence back in Italy and was the subject of a European arrest warrant.. But in July 2021 he was sufficiently confident of his new alias that he appeared in a local newspaper feature, boasting of his restaurant's \"regional and home-made recipes\" such as ravioli, risotto and tagliatelle. . Greco, using the name of a criminal from Puglia in the south-east of Italy, now had a grey beard and glasses. The feature called him an Italian by birth but at heart a local to Saint-Étienne.. He was, however, still being pursued by Italy's foremost anti-mafia prosecutor, Nicola Gratteri, who has spent decades tackling the rise of the 'Ndrangheta.. In a statement, Italy's Carabinieri military police said that since 2019, investigators had traced Greco's support network, which ultimately led them across the Alps to Saint-Étienne.. Interpol said . , with French authorities carrying out surveillance of Greco's location. Italian police then confirmed his identity and moved in to arrest him.. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi praised the police for bringing to justice one of Italy's worst criminals, while the head of the Calabria region, Roberto Occhiuto, said the arrest underlined Italy's commitment to the fight against all forms of organised crime..

It comes days after workers said their final goodbye to the iconic plane, dubbed the Queen of the Skies. . The 747 is one of the world's most recognisable planes, having been in production for more than 50 years, and is credited with starting the era of the jumbo jet, being the first aircraft to earn the nickname.. On Tuesday, thousands of employees from Boeing gathered at the company's factory in Everett, Washington - the home of the 747 since 1967 -  to say farewell. . Among those in attendance was actor John Travolta, an aviation enthusiast and private pilot. . As an ambassador for Qantas airlines, he remembered learning to fly the 747-400.. \"[It was] the toughest programme that any commercial pilot will ever have to endure,\"  he said.. Elsewhere in the crowd were also some of those who helped develop the jet in the 1960s - the so-called \"incredibles\".. The last 747 rolled off the assembly line 7 December, completing inspections, flight tests and getting a paint job before finally being handed over to Atlas, which operates the aircraft as freighters.. Designed in just 28 months, the 747 was the first ever twin-aisle jetliner and was first introduced by the now-defunct airline Pan Am in 1970.. Traditionally one of Boeing's best selling products, the 747 has suffered declining demand in recent years, as both the company and its European rival Airbus developed more fuel-efficient and profitable planes.  . In 2020, Boeing announced that it would end production. Its largest new jet, the delayed 777X, is not expected to hit the market until 2025.. ",

The . , .  and .  have officially normalised relations with Israel since 2020 as part of the US-brokered Abraham Accords. . Historically, members of the Arab League had refused to recognise Israel, a factor in perpetuating the Arab-Israeli conflict. . Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994.. An accord with Sudan holds particular symbolic importance as Khartoum was the venue for an Arab League meeting in 1967 where members vowed not to recognise Israel, after the Arab-Israeli war three months earlier.. Sudan's foreign ministry said Mr Cohen and Lt-Gen Burhan had \"discussed means for establishing fruitful relations with Israel\" and strengthening cooperation in \"agricultural, energy, health, water, education fields with special emphasis on security and military fields\".. It did not say whether a peace agreement would be signed.. The growing number of Arab countries formalising relations with Israel has been condemned by the Palestinians, who see it as a betrayal of their cause.. For years, Arab countries conditioned peace talks with Israel on its withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war, and the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.. Speaking on his return to Israel on Thursday night, Mr Cohen said his trip had been made \"with the consent of the United States\".. The visit, he said, \"lays the foundations for a historic peace agreement with a strategic Arab and Muslim country. The peace agreement between Israel and Sudan will promote regional stability and contribute to the national security of the State of Israel\".. Mr Cohen said a signing ceremony is expected to take place after the planned transfer of power in Sudan to a civilian government following a military coup in October 2021.. ",
