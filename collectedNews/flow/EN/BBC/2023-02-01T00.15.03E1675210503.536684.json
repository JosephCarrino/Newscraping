        "content": "City police who are on the frontline against militants believe they were targeted to demoralise them.. It comes two months after the Pakistani Taliban abandoned a ceasefire.. Since then violence has been on the rise, with frequent attacks on police and soldiers.. A claim that the hard-line Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as it is known, carried out Monday's bombing was later denied by the group, which blamed it on the commander of a breakaway faction. . Some observers are questioning the denial - they suggest it could be a distraction ploy.. In the past the TTP has refrained from claiming some attacks on mosques, schools or markets, preferring to cast its violence as a war with security forces and not against the Pakistani people.. This video can not be played. Pakistan mosque blast: Mass funeral held for police victims. The TTP has been fighting Pakistan's armed forces and police for years, with huge loss of life. An offshoot of the Afghan Taliban, the group shares the same hard-line ideology, but is separate from it. . At the top of a long list of its demands, the Pakistani Taliban wants to impose its interpretation of Sharia law in Pakistan's north-west. . At one point about a decade ago, the TTP threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas it controlled along the mountainous border with Afghanistan, which has been a hotbed of militant activity for decades.. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot. She had been campaigning for girls' education.. A major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre - an attack the TTP didn't claim and which killed 141 people, most of them children - greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan. . Amid public fury, the army destroyed militant centres and pushed insurgents over the border into Afghanistan. Militant violence inside Pakistan fell.. But in recent years attacks by the TTP and others have been on the rise again in north-west Pakistan.. After the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, former Pakistani PM Imran Khan offered militants who had been hiding over the border a chance to return home and settle down - if they laid down their arms.  . The militants returned but didn't agree to hand over their weapons - and that is where the current problems started. This led to the dialogue begun by Imran Khan breaking down. . The new political and military leaders who came in after he was ousted last year didn't agree with the militants' demands and stopped talking to the Pakistani Taliban. As a result the TTP ended the ceasefire in November and resumed attacks. . Ashraf Ali, who runs a blood donation organisation, said people in Peshawar were living in fear. . \"I, along with my family and all the citizens, are in deep trauma. People are scared here,\" he told the BBC.. \"Everyone is worried about what is going to happen next because it was a long journey from terrorism to tourism in Peshawar and now again Peshawar has been badly affected with terrorism.\" . Pakistan says its forces are ready to take on the militants. But the police remain ill-equipped to fight the highly trained and well-armed insurgents. Recent militant attacks include overrunning police stations - in some cases police did not offer resistance. . The public want the violence ended once and for all, and experts are now calling for an all-out military operation to beat the militants, as happened in 2014. . But Pakistanis are dejected and critical of the state's attempts to deal with militancy, which has gone on for two decades in a cycle that seems to keep repeating itself. . Many think there are still elements within the Pakistan security and civil establishment who are soft on the militants and that's the reason the threat isn't tackled properly.. ",

        "content": "\"Sometimes justice is served even when there is no conviction,\" she said.. The charges date back to as far as 1998. . Kelly, 56, was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. . Last year, he was also convicted on sex crimes charges for which he is scheduled  to be sentenced next month and likely won't be allowed for release until he is 80.. Cook County State's Attorney Foxx announced the state's case in 2019, saying the incidents occurred from May 1998 to January 2010. Illinois has no statute of limitations on child sex abuse charges.. But federal prosecutors in Chicago and New York moved more briskly to file indictments and along with Covid-19 delays, the Cook County courts were slowed. . \"Due to the extensive sentences that these convictions hold, our office has decided not to continue to expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments that we previously charged Mr. Kelly,\" Ms Foxx said. . She said resources will be put to better use to prosecute other sexual offenders. . In 2019, Ms Foxx had urged victims to come forward in order to bring charges against Kelly.  . Lanita Carter, who came forward in 2019, objected to this decision to drop charges. . \"I have spent nearly twenty years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,\" she said, \"With today's announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone.\". Kelly also faces a sexual misconduct case in Hennepin County Minnesota, but that case has been paused during the ongoing federal cases as well. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Protests take place across France over pension age rise. Anti-government corteges were as loud and as big, if not louder and bigger than on the first day of action.. The number of marchers was expected to surpass the 1.12 million recorded 12 days ago.. Eight key unions took part in the strike, which disrupted schools, public transport and oil refineries.. The CGT trade union said half a million protesters had gathered in Paris alone, although authorities put the number at 87,000, and put the total number across France as high as 2.8 million.. But for all the mass mobilisation, it is still far from clear if the protesters can force Mr Macron to back down. The government can withstand any number of \"days of action\" like this so long as they take place along the predictable and orderly lines that they have so far. . Mr Macron's government is pushing ahead with its pension age reforms in the face of opinion polls that suggest two-thirds of voters are opposed to the changes, which begin their passage through the National Assembly next week.. Without a majority in parliament, the government will have to rely on the right-wing Republicans for support as much as the ruling parties' own MPs.. Hours before the main protest began in the Place d'Italie in central Paris, thousands of marchers turned out in Toulouse, Marseille and Nice in the south, and Saint Nazaire, Nantes and Rennes in the west. . A reported 11,000 police were deployed to cover the demonstrations taking place in more than 200 towns and cities. Some skirmishes were reported at the end of the Paris route in Place Vauban and 30 people were arrested. The interior minister praised police for their handling of the protests.. \"Mr Macron is certain to lose,\" far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon told reporters in Marseille. \"Nobody wants his reforms, and the more the days go by, the greater the opposition to them.\". Karima, 62, held up a placard in Paris highlighting that the government's plans hurt women far more than men: \"Lots of us already have broken careers and will have to work even longer than men in order to have a full pension.\". There was severe disruption to transport, with three-quarters of trains outside Paris cancelled and only two driverless metro lines operating normally in Paris. Large crowds were reported on one of the main overground lines in the capital.. Transport strikes no longer have the capacity to throttle France like they used to. The proportion of public sector workers on strike was actually lower on Tuesday than on 19 January - a sign, presumably, of a fear of lost wages.. The CGT union said at least three-quarters of workers had walked out at the big TotalEnergies oil refineries and fuel depots, although the company said the number was far lower. Power plants reported reduced production after workers went on strike at the main electricity company EDF.. One of the main teachers' unions said some 55% of secondary school teachers had walked out, although the government said the figure was just over a quarter. High school pupils staged protests outside some schools and students said they would occupy Sciences Po university in Paris in support of the strikers.. \"A lot of French people feel that working is more and more painful. It's not that they don't want to work, they don't want to work in these conditions,\" Sciences Po political scientist Bruno Palier told the BBC.. There was also evidence that while raising the state pension age was a unifying call to arms, people were turning out for wider reasons, too.. A male nurse said he was there because conditions in public hospitals had become intolerable. Teachers are angry at the state of schools. Mr Macron the bogeyman was pilloried in cartoon and effigy.. For the president and for Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, that is a good argument for sticking to their guns: letting the people work off their anger, which is really just an expression of their powerlessness in the face of remorseless and incomprehensible change.. At 62, France's retirement age is lower than most other countries in Western Europe. Italy, Germany and Spain have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while in the UK it is 66.. Mr Macron's government has indicated it may move some way on the detail of its reform but has refused to give in on the main thrust of the raising the retirement age by two years to 64.. \"Any kind of reform that is going to ask people to work longer will be unpopular, but we've been elected on this reform,\" said Christopher Weissberg, an MP in Mr Macron's Renaissance party. . In France, very few workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments, but there are now only 1.7 workers paying into the shared pension fund per person in retirement.. \"We have a universal system, and the system has to pay for itself. If not, it's weakening and if it's weakening, at some point, people will lose their pension,\" Mr Weissberg warned.. Economist Prof Philippe Aghion said the reforms were necessary because France had a structural deficit of some €13bn ($14bn; £11bn) and raising the retirement age would also help increase the rate of employment in France.. \"That will give the government credibility to make some investments that it needs to make in schooling, in the hospital system that it needs to improve, and more investment in innovation and green industrialisation,\" he told BBC News.. France's opposition, fearing they will end up winning all the battles but not the war, may decide to escalate the dispute, so watch out for open-ended strikes at fuel depots, for example, or targeted power cuts. . So far the protests have been good-humoured and generally peaceful. As long as that remains the case, the government can ride out the opposition movement and see its bill quickly through parliament. . But if the economy starts hurting, things change. And if the protests turn violent, things change too.. ",

Anti-government protests - labelled \"riots\" by Iran's regime - swept across the country after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custody in September last year.

        "content": "Watch: Alec Baldwin rehearses with gun before fatal shooting. Santa Fe's District Attorney's Office accused the actor of \"many instances of extremely reckless acts\".. Halyna Hutchins died on the set of Rust in New Mexico after Mr Baldwin allegedly fired a prop gun. . The film's armourer has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter.. The documents released on Tuesday detailing the charges - first announced on 19 January - portray a chaotic set with a reckless approach to gun safety. . Mr Baldwin was \"distracted\" talking to family members on his mobile phone during training on how to operate the prop gun, Robert Shilling, a special investigator for the district attorney's office, wrote in a statement of probable cause filed with the manslaughter charges. . If Mr Baldwin had performed mandatory safety checks with armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and not pointed the gun at Hutchins, the \"tragedy would not have occurred\", Mr Shilling argued. . \"This reckless deviation from known standards and practice and protocol directly caused the fatal shooting,\" he said. . \"Baldwin knew the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at someone you don't intend on shooting,\" Mr Shilling added. . The charging document accuses him of a \"willful disregard for the safety of others\" and outlines at least a dozen \"acts or omissions of recklessness\" leading up to the shooting, including:. Lawyers for Mr Baldwin and Ms Gutierrez-Reed have said they intend to fight the charges in court.. If found guilty, Mr Baldwin and Ms Gutierrez-Reed could face up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 (£4,050) fine. They will be tried by a jury, according to prosecutors. . Ms Hutchins died in hospital after she was shot in the chest by a prop gun allegedly fired by Mr Baldwin during a rehearsal at Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe. . Mr Baldwin has previously denied responsibility for the shooting. He argued in media interviews that he did not pull the trigger on the gun and that it had just \"gone off\", prosecutors alleged. . But photos and videos from the Rust shooting depict Mr Baldwin practising drawing and firing the weapon with his finger inside the trigger guard and on the trigger multiple times, prosecutors said.. In addition, officials with the FBI found the gun could not be fired without pulling the trigger, according to a report the agency sent to the Santa Fe County Sherriff's Office. . The 30 Rock actor has filed a lawsuit against Ms Gutierrez-Reed and other people involved with the film, alleging they failed to check the gun carefully. . Ms Gutierrez-Reed has said she had checked that the rounds she loaded in the prop gun were dummies before it was handed to the film's assistant director Dave Halls, who then handed it to Mr Baldwin and told him it was an unloaded gun. . An initial investigation into the incident found there was \"a degree of neglect\", and producers were fined more than $136,000 by the New Mexico Environment Department for failing to enforce safety protocols.. Mr Halls has entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation. . When the charges were first announced, a lawyer representing Ms Hutchins' husband, Matthew, said the cinematographer's family supported the charges.. ",

        "content": "They still have no body to bury. No grave to visit. The last they heard from him was a phone call from prison, and he signed off with these words to his mother: \"Alright, I have to go. I'm glad you're OK.\"  . Neither had any inkling that it would be the last time they spoke.  . A month later, Mustafa was dead - one of 81 men killed on 12 March 2022, in the largest mass execution in modern Saudi history. . Mustafa's name is on a long and growing list put together by the campaign group Reprieve - which, along with the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, has been meticulously documenting Saudi executions for a new report.. Based on data collected since 2010, .  has found that:. Reprieve documented 147 executions in Saudi Arabia last year, but says there could well have been more. It also says the country has \"disproportionately\" used the death penalty against foreign nationals - including female domestic workers and low-level drug offenders. . Nearly a year on, officials haven't told Mustafa's family how he and the others were executed. His older brother, Yasser, says it has been a tragedy for the families. . \"We don't know whether they were given a decent burial or thrown in the desert or in the sea. We've no idea.\". Yasser is speaking publicly for the first time. He now lives in Germany, where he has been given political asylum after fleeing Saudi Arabia in 2016, fearing the same fate suffered by his brother.. Yasser says his brother was \"fun, sociable, and popular\". Since 2011, Mustafa took part in .  - led by the country's Shia minority - against the Saudi government. . He was detained in 2014. After his death, an official announcement said that he, along with 30 others, had been executed for the same string of offences - including attempted murder of security personnel, rape, robbery, bomb-making, stirring up strife and spreading chaos as well as trading in weapons and drugs.. \"They never provided any evidence. This lie cuts very deep,\" explains Yasser - who says his brother was still trying to appeal his conviction when the authorities executed him and the 80 other men.. \"Not only did they take their lives, they intentionally maligned them and accused them of things they've not done.\" . After rising to power, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi's de-facto ruler, promised to modernise the Kingdom - and suggested .  that his country, a key Western ally, was trying to \"minimise\" its use of the death penalty.. But, nearly five years on, Saudi Arabia remains one of the world's most prolific executioners - despite a lull that coincided with Saudi Arabia's presidency of the G20 and the start of the Covid pandemic. . The crown prince - known as MBS - has \"done the exact opposite of what he promised\" Reprieve's director, Maya Foa, tells me from her east London office. \"He has overseen vast numbers of executions and a brutal crackdown on people attending pro-democracy protests.\". What's more, she adds, there is a regime of secrecy around the death penalty, explaining that for many of the cases Reprieve have looked at, nobody knew they were even on death row.  . \"Their family members did not know. So you had people who were arrested, tried, sentenced to death and then executed in secret.\". Some families only discovered via social media that their loved ones had been killed, says Ms Foa - describing that lack of official information as one of the \"most cruel and distressing\" aspects of each case.. Traditionally, beheading has been the main method of execution in Saudi Arabia - the executions used to take place in public - with the names of those killed, and the charges they faced, published on government websites. . But human rights activists say the use of the death penalty has become much more opaque.. Nobody I spoke to knew exactly how executions are now carried out, though firing squads are also thought to be used. . The death penalty is part of a Saudi legal system which \"is unfair in its essence\", says Ali Adubisi, director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights. \"No type of independent civil society or human rights groups can operate there. If we weren't drawing attention to the executions, people would be killed in silence.\". Human Rights Watch said that 41 of the 81 men executed in March were from the Shia minority and that \".  in Saudi Arabia's criminal justice system suggest it is highly unlikely that any of the men received a fair trial\". They also heard reports of torture.. When Yasser was first allowed to visit Mustafa, 12 months after his arrest in 2014, he was shocked by what he saw.. \"Even though it had been a year since we had last seen him, he couldn't even stand up to greet us.. \"He'd fall over as soon as he tried - and when we asked him, he said it was because of torture. . \"We saw bruises on his body and he told us he'd been given electric shocks.\"   . The sister of another detainee told me her brother had also been badly tortured. . \"He said he was strung up by his feet and beaten. He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" says Zainab Abu Al-Khair, whose brother Hussein has been in prison since 2014. . Hussein - a Jordanian driver working for a wealthy Saudi family - was arrested with drugs in his car on the Jordan-Saudi border. Zainab is certain they were not his.  . Speaking from her home in Canada, she explains how Hussein's family have been struggling to make ends meet since his arrest. He has a disabled son and, after he was imprisoned, his 14-year-old daughter was \"sold into marriage\" in Jordan.. Last November, Saudi Arabia ended an unofficial moratorium on the death penalty for drug offences - a move described by the UN Human Rights Office as \"deeply regrettable\". Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed for such offences, . . . In prison, says Zainab, men have since been taken from Hussein's cell never to return. . It has left both Hussein and Zainab terrified. \"I can't even talk about him without my heart pounding,\" she told me. . \"I think of him all day and at night, I have bad dreams. The thought they might chop off his head - it's barbarity.. \"You can't imagine how hard it is. Sometimes I just sit alone and cry, cry, cry.\". Part of the anger she is feeling is directed at other countries for allowing Saudi Arabia \"to get away with it\". . Last March - four days after the mass execution of 81 men - the then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson met Mohammed bin Salman to try to persuade him to pump more oil to replace Russian fuel imports. Downing Street said Mr Johnson did raise concerns about Saudi Arabia's ongoing human rights issues.. Since coming to power, MBS has carried out social and economic reforms - including allowing women to drive - but they've been accompanied by intensified political repression.. The .  describes Saudi Arabia's human rights record as \"deplorable\" - a stain on its reputation, which it is busy trying to \"launder\" through sports and entertainment.. The BBC has sent three emails to the Saudi Human Rights Commission - a Saudi government organisation - asking to speak to an official, but has received no replies. . A statement to the BBC from the Saudi embassy in London noted that many other nations around the world have the death penalty, and that countries have different views about what penalties are appropriate. It said: \"As we respect their right to determine their own laws and customs, we hope that others will respect our sovereign right to follow our own judicial and legislative choices.\". But the comments failed to address the steep rise in executions under the crown prince, MBS, or the way the death penalty is being used, in contravention of international norms.. The UN Human Rights Office told the BBC it was \"deeply concerned about the trend in the use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia\".. \"In particular, we are concerned by the increase in the number of death sentences issued and upheld, including against child offenders, and for offences that do not meet the 'most serious crimes' threshold of international law, such as drug-related offences,\" it said.. For those whose loved ones are in prison, it's a desperately anxious time. Hussein's sister keeps a vigilant eye on the family chat group. . \"It's not a life to deal with this stress,\" she says. \"Every morning, every evening, we have to check he's still alive.\". ",
