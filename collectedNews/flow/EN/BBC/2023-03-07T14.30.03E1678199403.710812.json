        "content": "In the video, the Ukrainian soldier is seen smoking a cigarette in a trench. He says \"glory to Ukraine\" before being shot with automatic weapons.. He was named on Tuesday by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Shadura, who had been missing since 3 February.. The 30th Separate Mechanised Brigade said he was last seen near the eastern city of Bakhmut - the scene of fierce fighting in recent months.. \"Currently, the body of our serviceman is in the temporarily occupied territory,\" the statement said, citing preliminary information. It added the identification could be completed after the body was returned.. Before the soldier was named, Mr Shadura's sister told the BBC: \"My brother would certainly be capable of standing up to the Russians like that. . \"He never hid the truth in his life and certainly wouldn't do so in front of the enemy.\". In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the prisoner of war (POW) is shot dead. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured. It first emerged on social media on Monday.. Russia has not publicly commented on the incident.. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said: \"The shooting of an unarmed prisoner is a cynical and brazen disregard for the norms of international humanitarian law and the customs of war. This is what worthless murderers do, not warriors. . \"The Russian occupiers have once again shown that their main goal in Ukraine is the brutal extermination of Ukrainians.\". Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes since President Vladimir Putin launched a full scale-invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russia denies the allegations.. In his video address, President Zelensky said \"the occupiers\" killed \"a warrior who bravely said to their faces: 'Glory to Ukraine!'\". \"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\". Mr Zelensky was referring to a battle cry in Ukraine's military that has become popular among millions of Ukrainians.. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the footage was \"another proof this war is genocidal\", calling for an \"immediate investigation\" by the International Criminal Court.. Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets accused Russian troops of committing war crimes by violating the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of POWs.. And Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said a criminal investigation had already been opened.. Ukraine has previously accused Russian troops of torturing, raping and killing Ukrainian prisoners of war.. Last July, a video emerged that showed a captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. The Russian soldier filmed carrying out the attack in the town of Severodonetsk was identified as a member of a unit belonging to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.. In November, Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of executing a group of Russian prisoners.. It followed a video from the front line in eastern Ukraine showing the apparent surrender of a number of soldiers, in an incident that ended in their deaths.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "During a subsequent search of an Audi car, the head of a radioactive lightning rod was found in the spare tyre, reports say.. Serbian officials are continuing to question the three suspects.. The incident occurred at the Bezdan border crossing near the town of Sombor on Saturday at 20:30 (19:30 GMT).. There has been no detail about the amount of radioactive material involved or its potential impact, but workers at the border crossing were ordered to discard their clothing and undergo medical checks as a precaution, Serbian media report.. Hundreds of thousands of radioactive lightning rods were installed worldwide in the past few decades, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in the belief that they enhanced the chance of lightning strikes hitting the rods and not nearby targets.. In a report last year, the IAEA said that \"no convincing scientific evidence has been produced to demonstrate increased efficacy\" and many countries had decided to stop the production of these devices. Some have started to remove the radioactive sources from the lightning rods that have already been installed.. Experts from Serbia's Vinca nuclear research institute have reportedly moved the head of the lightning rod to a safer place.. ",

        "content": "Tuesday marked the sixth day of strikes and protests since mid-January, with unions saying it would be the biggest yet.. Most train and metro services have been cancelled, and many schools closed.. At least 260 demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday, with police estimates of between 1.1 million and 1.4 million taking part.. With the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader, Emmanuel Lépine, said last week that the aim of blocking fuel deliveries was to \"bring the French economy to its knees\".. There are eight refineries in mainland France and the hard-line CGT union said strikers had blocked the exits to all of them, including those run by TotalEnergies and Esso-ExxonMobil.. However, it was not clear how long the blockades would last.. In the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes to include power generation too.. So far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy, and the bill is proceeding through parliament.. Unions and the left know time is running out before the reform becomes a reality - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now.. President Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council. . As well as raising the pension age by two years, the government says workers would have to contribute for 43 years into France's shared pension fund before earning a full pension.. Very few French workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments.. Neighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age in recent years to reflect longer life expectancy. Italy, Germany and Spain have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while in the UK it is currently 66.. The majority of French citizens back the ongoing strikes, a poll by French survey group Elabe suggests.. According to the opinion poll, 56% of people support rolling strikes and 59% back the call to bring the country to a standstill.. Two-thirds of people support the protest movement against the government's planned pension reforms in general, the poll indicates.. However, the number of protesters taking to the streets began to fall last month and union leaders now believe rolling strikes are their best hope of success.. \"If the refineries are blocked we could run out of petrol by the end of the week,\" warned Thierry Cotillard, head of French supermarket group Les Mousquetaires.. Government spokesman Olivier Véran told France 2: \"We don't want French people to be, quote, unquote, 'victims' of a long-term blockade.\". Last week, he warned that the strikes could lead to an \"ecological, agricultural and health catastrophe\".. ",

        "content": "Watch: Japan forces H3 rocket to self-destruct after engine failure. Its space agency had to send a self-destruct command to the H3 rocket when its second-stage engine failed minutes after lift-off.. Observers say it is a significant setback for Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).. The government called the test failure \"extremely regrettable\".. The H3 rocket is the first medium-lift rocket designed by Japan in three decades. . It has been presented as a cheaper alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 for launching commercial and government satellites into Earth's orbit.. On Tuesday, engineers had aimed to send the 57m (187ft) rocket into space with a monitoring satellite on board. The ALOS-3 system is capable of detecting North Korean missile launches.. But Jaxa said soon after launch, engineers were forced to send a self-destruct prompt to the H3 after it experienced \"reduced velocity\" in the second stage of its launch. . Tuesday's launch came after an aborted launch in February, when the rocket failed to get off the launch pad due to faulty rocket boosters. . \"Unlike the previous cancellation and postponement, this time it was a complete failure,\" Hirotaka Watanabe, a space policy professor at Osaka University told Reuters.. \"This will have a serious impact on Japan's future space policy, space business and technological competitiveness,\" he added.. Japan's science minister Keiko Nagaoka said authorities would investigate the cause of the engine failure. . She apologised for \"failing to meet the expectations of the public and related parties\" and described the development as \"extremely regrettable\". . Japan had presented the H3 as a viable commercial alternative to the Falcon 9 rocket because the H3 ran on a lower-cost engine with 3D-printed parts. . Had the mission succeeded, Jaxa said it had planned to launch the H3 around six times a year for the next two decades.. Japan is deepening cooperation with the US in space and has committed to carrying cargo to the planned .  - which Nasa plans to deploy to the moon's orbit.. Tokyo's broader space programme also involves sending people to the moon again, including Japanese astronauts.. ",
