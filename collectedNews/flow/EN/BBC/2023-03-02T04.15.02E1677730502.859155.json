        "content": "It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter sends video from scene of fatal crash. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke after visiting the site of Tuesday night's head-on collision between a passenger service and a freight train. . The local stationmaster has been charged with manslaughter. The Greek transport minister has resigned.. Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors.. The accident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. The passenger train carrying some 350 people collided with a freight train as it emerged from a tunnel after leaving the town of Larissa.. It is still unclear why the two services were running on the same track.. The stationmaster, who is in charge of signalling, denies wrongdoing and has blamed the accident on a possible technical failure.. After visiting the site, Mr Mitsotakis said everything pointed to \"a tragic human error\".. \"Justice will do its job,\" he said in a televised address. \"People will be held accountable, while the state will be on the side of the people.\" . Announcing his resignation, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated: \"When something so tragic happens, it is impossible to continue and pretend it didn't happen.\" . Trade unions said collisions have multiple factors and the crash had highlighted chronic deficiencies, including lack of staff, broken signals and outdated facilities.. The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed and the first two caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\", Thessaly regional governor Kostas Agorastos said.. The train was travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki, which has a sizeable student population, and it is believed many on board were students returning there after a holiday for Greek Orthodox lent.. Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\".. Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage, told Reuters news agency: \"The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Larissa's mayor said some of those who died would only be identifiable through genetic testing.. Relatives of missing passengers have provided DNA samples to help the identify bodies, a hospital in Larissa said. . ",

        "content": "Jurors earlier in the day visited the sprawling, 1,700-acre hunting lodge to assess the crime scene.. The disbarred attorney denies involvement in the 7 June 2021 deaths.. Mr Murdaugh reported finding the bodies of his wife and son near the dog kennels on the property in South Carolina's Colleton County. . Over several hours on Wednesday afternoon, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters painstakingly led jurors through the state's theory.. At the time of the murders, Mr Waters said, a \"gathering storm\" was threatening to expose Mr Murdaugh's decade of financial crimes - crimes that Mr Murdaugh himself has admitted in court. . The murders of Maggie and Paul, Mr Waters said, were Mr Murdaugh's desperate attempt to gain sympathy and delay looming inquiries into his theft of millions of dollars.. The state's case has been limited by a lack of physical evidence - the murder weapons were not found, there were no eyewitnesses and no blood found on Mr Murdaugh's clothing. . But Mr Waters on Wednesday emphasised that Mr Murdaugh was with his wife and son just minutes before the killings, something the defendant had denied for 20 months before acknowledging it last week in court. . \"After an exhaustive investigation, there is only one person who had the motive, who had the means, who had the opportunity to commit these crimes, and also whose guilty conduct after these crimes betrays him,\" Mr Waters said.. The defence will present their closing arguments on Thursday. . Earlier this week, Mr Murdaugh's lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, asked Judge Clifton Newman to grant jurors time to visit the 1,700-acre estate, known as Moselle, to get a better idea of where the bodies were found relative to the kennels and the Murdaugh home, where Mr Murdaugh originally said he had been napping at the time of the killings.. \"You just can't really appreciate the spatial issues without really seeing them,\" Mr Harpootlian told the court on Monday. . Prosecutors, however, argued against granting jurors access to the estate, saying that the property has changed in the 20 months since the killings. . They said that some of the trees between the kennels and the Murdaugh home have grown taller and thicker.. Only the judge, members of the jury, police and security personnel were present for the visit, but members of the trial's media pool also paid a brief visit to the property on Wednesday morning.. \"It is a heavy place to visit,\" the Wall Street Journal's Valerie Bauerlein wrote in a pool report. \"The property has stood vacant for 20 months and the grass is high.\". After seeing the kennels, a nearby shed and feed room, she observed: \"There was no visible sign that two people had died in a violent manner in such close proximity, no blood stain or anything similar to it.\". Moselle is where the family lived for several years. It includes their home, as well as dog kennels, a cabin and sprawling lands, fields and forests, where Mr Murdaugh would hunt with his two sons.. The estate is now listed under contract at $3.9m (£3.9m), . .. Mr Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster, testified that much of the estate is \"really not even accessible\" because it is filled with swamps and there are no built roadways in many parts.. If convicted, Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years in jail, though prosecutors have argued for a life sentence.. This video can not be played. Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial. ",

        "content": "It is a growing issue for people in the area, her lawyer told BBC News. . The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",
