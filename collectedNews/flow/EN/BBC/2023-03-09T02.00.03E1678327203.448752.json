        "content": "Watch: Police car flipped over as Georgians stay defiant on streets. The crowds are angry at a controversial Russian-style law, which would class non-government and media groups as \"foreign agents\" if they receive more than 20% of their funds from abroad.. On Wednesday evening, police pushed back protesters who pulled down a metal barrier outside parliament. . The crowds were ordered to disperse and some people have been injured.. Pictures from Georgian TV showed hundreds of riot police on the streets late on Wednesday night, wearing helmets and holding shields. At least one police car had been overturned. . Clouds of tear gas rose above the streets around the parliament building as police tried to break up the protests. . Earlier, tens of thousands of people joined the second day of protests. . They took place outside parliament, where on Tuesday lawmakers backed a first reading of the controversial new law, which has been widely condemned internationally. . A similar law in Russia has been used to severely limit press freedom and supress civil society. . \"We think that our government is under Russian influence and it's very bad for our future,\" said Lizzie, one of many students taking part in the protests.. The protesters worry that the new law, if passed, would damage the country's hopes of joining the EU. . \"People are really angry because this is not about one specific thing, it's about the future of Georgia and it's about how we'll function as a country,\" another demonstrator named Tekla Tevdorashvili told the BBC.. \"Everyone is really against this and I think that's why they're so afraid and that's why the government is trying to use everything that they can against the people to silence us but we will not be silenced.\". In a statement, the US expressed solidarity with the protesters and called on Georgia's government to allow peaceful demonstrations.. \"We urge the government of Georgia to respect the freedom of peaceful assembly and peaceful protests,\" state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. \"We are standing with the people of Georgia and the aspirations that they have.\". Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, also expressed his support for the Georgian people. . Authorities said 55 police were hurt during the first night of protests, when stones and petrol bombs were thrown at them. Some of the most arresting images of Tuesday night came when a water cannon was sprayed at protesters waving EU flags. . Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili denounced the \"stir\" over the draft law, which went through its first reading inside parliament on Tuesday. Ruling party Georgian Dream maintains the legislation dates back to US legislation in the 1930s. The same argument was used by Russia after it passed a similar law in 2012.. Russia's law has since been expanded to suppress Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers. Anyone identified as a foreign agent now has to highlight a foreign-agent label on their publication.. Opposition-supporting TV stations have also dubbed the proposed legislation as a \"Russian law\". . Georgia has applied to the European Union for candidate status and also aims to join Nato, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Another student, Lia Chagovadze, said she and her friends were there to fight for Western values and freedom, while Nanuka Shakinovi said the protesters would not allow the government to stop Georgia's push to join the EU: \"We are going to fight them and we will not stop until we win.\". \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old Luka Kimeridze.. Georgian Dream chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said criticism of the draft law as similar to Russia's own repressive legislation was misleading. \"In the end, the stir will die out and the public will have transparency in the funding of NGOs,\" he said.. However, Eka Gigauri of Transparency International told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Political tensions in Georgia have been heightened by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seen by many Georgians as a war of aggression by Moscow, and many thousands of Russians have fled there. However, the government in Tbilisi has adopted a neutral stance, refusing to openly back Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia.. Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". She has vowed to veto the legislation, but Georgian Dream has enough votes to override the president's veto in parliament. The party has applied to the Council of Europe for its opinion.. Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. ",

        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. For now, the Mexican government remains tight-lipped about the motive for the attack. However, the attorney general's office in the state of Tamaulipas said the theory that this was a case of mistaken identity was \"strengthening\".  . Officials wouldn't comment on two specific suggestions - that a drug gang had confused them either for US-based rivals, Haitian drug gang members or people smugglers. But they said there were multiple and \"diverse\" lines of investigation, and that none was being ruled out at this stage. . Matamoros is caught between warring factions of the Gulf Cartel, as they battle for control of the so-called plazas - the drug smuggling routes north into the US.. Apparently unwitting, the group of friends from North Carolina drove their minivan straight into that maelstrom. Their ordeal lasted for four days.  . As the US citizens were being moved between safehouses to prevent detection, the US Embassy issued a statement demanding their immediate release. For any Mexican cartel - or even a common criminal gang operating along the border - that will have spelt trouble.  . The armed gang will have understood immediately that the full force of a joint operation by US and Mexican federal law enforcement was going to be turned in their direction. Had the motive been ransom, as is so often the case in Mexico, they will have realised it was now very unlikely to be paid.. Far easier, then, to simply turn the Americans over and deflect some of the intense heat bearing down on their gang. . \"My guess is that's the most reasonable explanation for what happened,\" says Mexican drug war analyst, Alejandro Hope. \"They might have had connections or contacts with local police and they just told their contacts where their safehouse was.\". Kidnappings in Mexico are disturbingly common. Last year, Mexico reached the horrific figure of 100,000 people disappeared or missing in the country. Most kidnappings are carried out with complete impunity, particularly in the case of undocumented immigrants travelling north to the US.  . In comparison, this case was resolved incredibly quickly. Some Mexicans voiced frustration on social media at the speed with which such crimes are resolved when foreigners are involved. . \"In under a week. And the thousands and thousands of kidnapped Mexicans?\" wrote one Twitter user.  . \"That's not untrue,\" says Mr Hope. \"Mexican institutions have a limited set of capabilities. But if they focus those capabilities on specific cases, yes, they can solve them.\"  . \"It's about visibility and political impact,\" he says.  . Clearly, in this instance, the political will in Mexico to find a solution couldn't have been higher.. US Ambassador Ken Salazar met Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss the matter, and said the US State Department had \"no greater priority\" than the well-being of its citizens abroad.  . The case was brought to an end within 24 hours.  . This video can not be played. Mexico missing: 'If I find a body, I recover a piece of my son'. ",

She was hit with six bullets.. \"The findings are deeply troubling and sobering,\" said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta.. The report found Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD):. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the justice department's Civil Rights Division said the review demonstrates that Louisville's police and city government have \"failed to adequately protect and serve\" and \"breached the public's trust\". . \"The police used excessive force, subjecting people to unlawful strikes, tasings, and canine bites,\" Ms Clarke said. . \"The police sought search warrants without justification and carried out no-knock warrants unlawfully, evading the constitution, defying federal law, and putting ordinary citizens in harm's way.\" . Attorney General Merrick Garland said: \"This conduct is unacceptable. It is heartbreaking... It is also an affront to the vast majority of officers who put their lives on the line to serve Louisville with honour.\" . The justice department blamed the findings on deficiencies in policies, training, supervision and accountability that contributed to LMPD and Louisville Metro's unlawful conduct.. Officials opened their investigation on 26 April 2021.. It was just over a year after plainclothes police officers executed a \"no-knock\" search warrant - allowing entry without knocking or identification - at Ms Taylor's home, firing over 30 shots and hitting her with six bullets.. The emergency medical technician was asleep with her boyfriend when police burst into her apartment. Her boyfriend fired once at what he said he believed were intruders - he has since received a $2m (£1.7m) settlement from the city.. Ms Taylor's name became a rallying cry during months of racial justice protests around the US in the summer of 2020.. ",

        "content": "He said he was cut out of early discussions on where the virus came from because he suspected a lab leak.. Many scientists point out there is no evidence that Covid leaked from a lab.. The White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the virus's origins.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is near the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a world-leading virus laboratory that conducted research into coronaviruses.. Dr Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when the outbreak began in 2020, was an early proponent of the lab leak theory.. He told the House select subcommittee, formed by the new Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, it was \"not scientifically plausible\" to him that the virus had natural origins.. He claimed he was \"sidelined\" at the beginning of the pandemic and excluded from meetings as his views were not in line with other major scientists like Dr Anthony Fauci, the de-facto face of the US pandemic response.. \"It was told to me that they wanted a single narrative, and that I obviously had a different point of view,\" he said. \"Science has debate and they squashed any debate.\". Dr Redfield also spoke of his opposition to so-called gain of function research, in which viruses are manipulated to become more infectious in lab environments. . He said that US agencies had likely funded such research at the Wuhan institute.. The House panel, which consists of nine Republicans and seven Democrats, has said it aims to stay above the fray of partisan politics.. But that may prove difficult given the divisive subject matter.. On the panel is Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who used Wednesday's hearing to air her concerns about decisions made by federal agencies during the pandemic.. At the outset of the hearing, Democrat Raul Ruiz protested the inclusion of witness Nicholas Wade, the author of a controversial book on race and genetics that has been endorsed by a former Ku Klux Klan leader.. Mr Ruiz argued Mr Wade had written a dangerous book and his testimony could not be relied upon, but Mr Wade defended his book and remained at the hearing.. The spectre of Donald Trump also hung over the proceedings, with Democrat Jamie Raskin suggesting the former president had been sycophantic and fawning in his approach to Chinese President Xi Jinping.. The House probe comes a week after FBI Director Christopher Wray said an unintentional lab incident was \"most likely\" how Covid originated.. A few days before that, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan, but could only reach that conclusion with \"low confidence\".. In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said that there was no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.. ",

Gang violence and kidnappings in Haiti have risen sharply since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021.. The Caribbean nation has been facing a growing economic crisis. . The charity, commonly known by its French abbreviation MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières), made the move after heavily armed gangs expanded their territory to new areas in Port-au-Prince and nearby towns.. Several schools have also closed as kidnappings increase.. Earlier this year, an MSF-backed public hospital located south of the capital also closed after a patient was killed by a bullet as he left the emergency room.. Cité Soleil, an impoverished neighbourhood on the outskirts of Haiti's capital, now has just one private hospital and one other MSF operation, which is reducing operations.. Vincent Harris, a medical adviser for the aid group, said: \"We are living scenes of warfare just meters [yards] from the establishment.. \"Our hospital has not been directly targeted but we have been a collateral victim of the fighting since the hospital found itself on the frontline.\". Field communication manager Alexandre Marcou said a child who was on oxygen had died in a security room, where patients are sent for protection from gunfire around the building.. A 70-year-old man had also been found shot as he tried to cross the street to the hospital.. Haiti has been led by Prime Minister Ariel Henry since Moïse's death, but he has failed to rein in the gangs which control much of the capital.. Mr Henry has repeatedly called for the deployment of an international force to help police in their fight against the criminal gangs.. So far, no country has offered to lead such a force, while Mr Henry says it is key to providing security so that long-postponed elections can be held.. This video can not be played.
