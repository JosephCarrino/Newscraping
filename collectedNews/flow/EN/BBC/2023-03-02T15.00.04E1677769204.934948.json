        "content": "Russia's foreign minister accused the West of \"blackmail and threats\". . India had wanted to focus on other issues affecting developing nations, but it said the differences over Ukraine \"could not be reconciled\".. \"We tried, but the gap between the countries was too much,\" India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said.. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. The group's foreign ministers - including Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Antony Blinken of the US and China's Qin Gang - were meeting in Delhi under India's presidency. It was the first face-to-face meeting of the two top US and Russian diplomats since the war began, just over a year ago.. Mr Blinken met Mr Lavrov for about 10 minutes on the sidelines of the summit, and told him the West would stand by Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", a senior state department official said. Mr Blinken also pressed Russia to rejoin the New Start nuclear arms control treaty that it recently withdrew from and abide by the terms.. Russian officials denied any negotiations had taken place. Earlier, Russia also accused the West of \"burying\" a deal to allow some Ukrainian grain exports - but the US countered by saying Moscow was hampering Ukrainian exports.. Meanwhile Russian officials said Moscow and Beijing had agreed to oppose what they called Western blackmail and threats - but this hasn't been confirmed by China. . \"We speak about manners. Well, our Western counterparts have gotten really bad with these,\" Mr Lavrov said after Thursday's talks. \"They are not thinking of diplomacy any more; they now only deal in blackmail and threatening everyone else.\". Indian PM Narendra Modi had opened the session by speaking up for developing nations, saying those present had a responsibility to them.. \"We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,\" Mr Modi told the ministers gathered in Delhi, urging delegates to find common ground. . \"After years of progress, we are at risk today of moving back on the sustainable development goals. Many developing countries are struggling with unsustainable debts while trying to ensure food and energy security,\" he said.. \"They are also most affected by global warming caused by richer countries. This is why India's G20 presidency has tried to give a voice to the Global South.\". It was a rare address by Mr Modi in English - a sign of how seriously he wanted his message to be taken. He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions. . India's slogan for the G20 is \"One Earth, One Family, One Future\". Mr Modi called on delegates to take it to heart and focus on issues that unite them.  . Thursday's schedule included sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency. . Before the talks a former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make delegates overlook their differences on the war.  Indian diplomats worked towards a consensus on less politically contentious issues.. Foreign Minister Jaishankar presented a chair's summary after Thursday's talks, meaning participants had been unable to reach a joint statement. . \"There were issues and very frankly they were concerned with the Ukraine conflict. There were divergences,\" he said, noting the \"polarised views of some countries, we were not able to bridge on this occasion.\". Last week, G20 finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on a closing statement at their meeting in the city of Bangalore (Bengaluru), in the first ministerial meeting in the run-up to the leaders' summit later this year. . Strained relations between the US and China, which has refused to oppose Russia's invasion, were also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.. Experts say Delhi also has the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together. . India has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. It has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of more than a billion people.  . But it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders.. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea.. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea's son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk. . The OCCRP claimed in a .  that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports.. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material.. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials.. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.  . NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa.. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle.. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. . The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa's Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled . .. The story examined Mr Ayuk's involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians. . After the story was published, the M&G's web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet's entire website for a morning in response to the complaint. . M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website. . Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\".. Last November during the UN's climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called . .. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN's flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk's US fraud conviction. . The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication.. Two weeks later, Climate Home News' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered.. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed. . Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles.. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\". Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered.. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\". . Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\". When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims. . Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication.. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.. ",

        "content": "A UN official said their submissions were \"irrelevant\" and \"tangential\" to the issues being discussed.. Self-styled guru Nithyananda is wanted in India in several cases, including rape and sexual assault.. Nithyananda, who claims he founded the United States of Kailasa (USK) in 2019, has denied the allegations against him.. USK's appearance at the UN events last week had made headlines in India. The Indian government hasn't publicly commented on the matter yet. . A UN official told the BBC in an email that \"USK representatives attended two UN public meetings in Geneva in February\". . The first was a discussion on the representation of women in decision-making systems, organised by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 22 February. USK representatives also participated in a second discussion on sustainable development, hosted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), on 24 February.. These general discussions are public meetings open to anyone who is interested, said Vivian Kwok, a media officer at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which oversees the two committees.. Ms Kwok said USK's written submission to CEDAW would not be included in their report as it was \"irrelevant to the topic of the general discussion\".. She also said that a statement made by a USK representative at the second discussion would not be taken into consideration as its focus \"was tangential to the topic at hand\".. A video on the UN website of the second session shows that when questions are invited from attendees, a woman introduces herself as Vijayapriya Nithyananda, \"the permanent ambassador of the United States of Kailasa\" and says she wants to ask a question about \"indigenous rights and sustainable development\".. She describes USK as the \"first sovereign state for Hindus\" established by Nithyananda, the \"supreme pontiff of Hinduism\". She also claims that USK has been \"successful with sustainable development\" because it provided necessities such as food, shelter and medical care for free to all its citizens. Her question is regarding what measures can be put in place to \"stop the persecution\" of Nithyananda and the people of Kailasa. . Others who asked questions at the discussion included a representative of an organisation called One Ocean Hub and a lecturer at Essex University.. Former Indian diplomat Preeti Saran, who holds the Asia Pacific seat at CESCR, was among the attendees at the discussion. The BBC has emailed her for comment.. Nithyananda, who was facing charges of rape, fled India in 2019. A female disciple had accused him of rape in 2010, after which he was briefly arrested before getting bail. He was charged in court in 2018.. Days before he left the country, a separate police complaint had also accused him of kidnapping and confining children at his ashram in the western state of Gujarat. . It's unclear where he escaped to and how he reached there. . That same year, he claimed to have bought an island off the coast of Ecuador and founded a new country called Kailasa, named after a mountain in the Himalayas that is considered the abode of the Hindu god Shiva. . At the time, Ecuador denied that he was in the country, and said that \"Nithyananda has not been given asylum by Ecuador or has been helped by the government of Ecuador\".. Nithyananda has not made any public appearances since 2019, though videos of his sermons are regularly released on his social media channels. .  reported last year that Nithyananda's UK representative had attended \"a glamorous Diwali party at the House of Lords\" on the invitation of two Conservative members.. News of the UN event began circulating on Indian social media after Nithyananda's Twitter account tweeted a photo of Vijayapriya Nithyananda.. A tweet thread later appeared to introduce USK's ambassadors to different parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and the Caribbean. . According to its website, Kailasa counts \"two billion practising Hindus\" among its population. It also claims to have a flag, a constitution, a central bank, a passport and an emblem.. ",

The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",

Japan remains the only G7 country that doesn't recognise such unions. .

The prime minister also reiterated his position on Wednesday that a ban on same-sex marriage is \"not unconstitutional\" but said his stand should not be seen as a form of discrimination.. Local LGBTQ groups have accused Mr Kishida of backpedalling on commitments made in recent weeks - saying his words contradicted his actions.. He held a meeting with LGBTQ activists last month after .  who said he didn't \"even want to look at\" sexual minorities. He appointed a special aide for LGBTQ issues and also said his party would consider a new bill. . The activists also said it was inaccurate for Mr Kishida to state that same-sex marriage was \"not unconstitutional\" in Japan, when local courts have ruled otherwise in at least two precedent-setting decisions.. The public attitude towards same-sex marriage has changed, especially among younger voters, said the Marriage for Equality Japan (MFEJ) group. A recent poll shows two-thirds of voters support making same-sex marriage legal.. \"I think this is one of the reason why the government is estranged from public opinion, as the most in the heart of the government are elderly men,\" said MFEJ chairperson Makiko Terahara..
