        "content": "The crump of Ukrainian air defences could be heard in the distance as we were led into a basement, to be met with the sight of dozens of prisoners taking shelter from the Russian attack.. Prisoner exchanges have become a regular feature of this war and for Kyiv it is crucial that they continue. Ukraine said this month it had secured the release of 1,762 men and women so far in prisoner swaps. These are highly sensitive operations, often taking months to arrange.. Under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war must not be paraded or exposed to the public.. We were allowed to approach who we wanted and asked for their consent. But the guards were with us wherever we went and these men were unlikely to have been speaking freely.. Many hid their faces to further protect their identities.. Last November, .  by both sides, based on interviews with prisoners who spoke of cases of torture and ill-treatment.. Here the guards appeared keen to show they were treating the prisoners well.. One fighter said he had been working for a mercenary group. He had been brought to this facility three days earlier, after he was taken prisoner near the eastern town of Soledar, captured last month by Russian forces.. A handful stared on defiantly. We met the gaze of one prisoner who said he was captured in the Luhansk region on 29 December. . \"I hope I will be exchanged and that I won't have to go back into the army,\" he said.. \"What if you have no choice?\" I asked.. He paused for a second: \"I have some ideas. I could come back by surrendering voluntarily.\". Leaving the shelter it became clear that half the prisoners had been wounded. . Some had bandaged hands or feet. Others would move with a heavy limp.. One young man became emotional as he described how he had lost his leg in a grenade explosion.. As we approached the pulsing sound of a compression drill, a small production line came into view where prisoners of war were putting together outdoor furniture sets.. They worked, again with their heads down.. A local company had a contract with the facility, we were told, and that meant the inmates could make some money too, mostly to spend on cigarettes and sweets.. Most prisoners of war are compelled to have jobs like this. Apparently only Russian officers had a choice.. At lunchtime the prisoners were marched to a temporary canteen on the top floor. Through the window a Ukrainian flag flapped in the cold wind. . They ate quickly and in silence, but for the sound of eating. Then, table by table, in a moment of perfect choreography, they stood together and shouted in Ukrainian: \"Thank you for lunch!\" . Inmates here are made to watch TV in Ukrainian, including documentaries on Ukrainian history and the southern city of Mariupol, which was all but flattened by a Russian siege and bombardment that lasted for months.. Some of the Ukrainian soldiers who had defended Mariupol were part of the last exchange.. We asked one inmate whether he understood what he was watching. . \"More or less,\" he said. \"I find it educational.\" He was unlikely to have said anything unflattering.. It is quite possible that some of the Russians in the room could not understand the programme they were having to watch, and they may not have wanted to.. The prisoners are allowed one phone call every two weeks, according to the guards. For their families back in Russia these calls are often the first chance they have to find out their sons have been captured.. \"Where are you? I've asked half the city about you!\" one young man's mother could be heard over the phone.. \"Mum, wait. I'm in captivity, I can't say more.\" . \"With the bloody Ukrainians?\" she said, before breaking down in tears.. \"That's it, Mum. Quiet,\" he told her, as the guard stood over him. \"The most important thing is that I'm alive and healthy.\"  . Some of the prisoners' calls went unanswered, leaving them hoping for another chance on the phone - and a future prisoner swap.. ",

        "content": "Welch became an international sex symbol in the 1960s, widely remembered for playing a bikini-clad cavewoman in the 1966 film One Million Years B.C.. She also won a Golden Globe for her role in 1974's The Three Musketeers.. Born Jo-Raquel Tejada in 1940, Welch grew up in California, where she won teen beauty pageants and later became a local weather forecaster.. During a brief stint in Dallas, Texas, the divorced mother-of-two modelled for the Neiman Marcus clothing store and worked as a cocktail waitress.. Her big break came in 1964 soon after she moved back to California, when she scored cameos in A House Is Not A Home, and Roustabout, a musical starring Elvis Presley.. She shot to prominence two years later, with her back-to-back roles in the sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage and the fantasy movie One Million Years B.C.. Welch only had a few lines in the latter, but promotional stills of her wearing a skimpy two-piece deerskin bikini turned her into a leading pin-up girl of the era.. Despite her public image, however, she long expressed discomfort with the representation of her body, once saying she \"was not brought up to be a sex symbol, nor is it in my nature to be one\".. \"The fact that I became one is probably the loveliest, most glamorous and fortunate misunderstanding,\" she added.. This video can not be played. Watch: What a Hollywood studio asked Raquel Welch to change her name to. Welch went on to address her image in her memoir, Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage, in which she opened up about her childhood, her early career woes as a single mother in Hollywood, and why she would never lie about her age.. In a career spanning over five decades, Welch appeared in more than 30 movies and 50 television shows.. It included playing the love interest of Frank Sinatra's character in 1968's Lady in Cement; the titular transgender heroine in 1970's Myra Breckenridge; and a Golden Globe-nominated performance in the 1987 TV drama Right to Die.. Later in life, she also released her own signature line of wigs, a jewellery and skincare collection, and a Mac Cosmetics makeup line.. Actress Reese Witherspoon was among those paying tribute, writing on Twitter that she \"loved\" working with Welch on Legally Blonde.. \"She was elegant, professional and glamorous beyond belief,\" said Witherspoon. \"Simply stunning.\". Actress and producer Viola Davis posted a clip of her singing \"I'm a Woman\" with Cher in 1975, writing: \"You were ageless to me...iconic\".. In 1978 she sang the same song with the famous puppet Miss Piggy, earning a tribute on Wednesday from the beloved comedy programme.. 'We'll never forget our remarkable friend Raquel Welch, one of our favorite guests on The Muppet Show,\" the Disney series tweeted.. Actor Paul Feig said he enjoyed working with her on TV series Sabrina the Teenage Witch.. \"Kind, funny and a true superstar whom I was pretty much in love with for most of my childhood,\" he wrote, adding: \"We've lost a true icon.\". She leaves behind a son, Damon Welch, and daughter Latanne \"Tahnee\" Welch, who is also an actress.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Family of victim charges Buffalo shooter in court room. Payton Gendron, 19, pleaded guilty to 25 counts, including first-degree murder and terrorism motivated by hate.. Ahead of the sentencing on Wednesday, a family member rushed towards the killer and was restrained by security. . Other relatives shared emotional impact statements.. Barbara Massey, whose sister Katherine was killed, said to the gunman: \"You are going to come to our city and decide you don't like black people. Man, you don't know a damn thing about black people. We're human.\". Ms Massey's statement was interrupted by her own son lunging toward the gunman. She told reporters outside court \"he saw me emotional and I'm his mom\".. \"We're close,\" she said. \"You hurt one of us, you hurt us all.\". Zaire Goodman, who was injured, suffers from survivor's guilt, his mother told the courtroom. . \"He is dealing with the pain that I as a mother cannot bear,\" Zeneta Everhart said.. \"On that day this terrorist made the choice that the value of a black human meant nothing to himâ€¦ whatever the sentence is that [the gunman] receives, it will never be enough.\". Brian Talley lost family member Geraldine Talley in the shooting. . He said: \"I forgive you, but I forgive you not for your sake, but for mine and for this black community.\". All of the 10 people killed were black. Three others were wounded.. Wayne Jones, the son of a victim, Celestine Chaney, addressed the killer: \"You've been brainwashed. You don't even know black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.. \"I hope you find it in your heart to apologise to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason.\". The killer wept as Tamika Harper shared memories of her murdered aunt, Geraldine Talley.. Ms Harper told him: \"Do I hate you? No. Do I want you to die? No. I want you to stay alive. I want you to think about this every day of your life.\". Investigators said the gunman researched the racial makeup of Buffalo, which was 200 miles (320km) away from his house in Conklin, New York, before his attack.. Wearing bullet-resistant armour, he live-streamed the 14 May attack at Tops Friendly Market after writing online how he had been inspired by other racially motivated shootings. . But speaking to the court on Wednesday he warned against copycat shootings.. The gunman, who is not eligible for parole, said: \"I shot and killed people because they were black. Looking back now, I can't believe I actually did it. . \"I believed what I read online and acted out of hate. I know I can't take it back, but I wish I could, and I don't want anyone to be inspired by me and what I did.\". As she delivered her decision, Judge Susan Eagan said: \"There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances.\". New York state no longer allows the death penalty, but prosecutors at the federal level may seek it over hate and domestic terror charges to which the gunman has pleaded not guilty.. ",
