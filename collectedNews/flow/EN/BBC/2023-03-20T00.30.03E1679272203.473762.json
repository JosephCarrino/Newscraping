        "content": "The Swiss National Bank said the deal was the best way to restore the confidence of financial markets and to manage risks to the economy. . The Bank of England said it welcomed the \"comprehensive set of actions\".. Credit Suisse shareholders were deprived of a vote on the deal and will receive one share in UBS for every 22.48 shares they own, valuing the bank at $3.15bn (£2.6bn). . At the close of business on Friday Credit Suisse was valued at around $8bn (£6.5bn). . But the deal has achieved what regulators set out to do - secure a result before the financial markets opened on Monday. . In a statement Switzerland's central bank said \"a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation\".. The federal government said in order to reduce any risks for UBS it would grant a guarantee against potential losses worth $9.6bn (£7.9bn) . The Swiss central bank has also offered liquidity assistance of up to $110bn (£90bn).. Global financial institutions were quick to praise the deal. . The Bank of England said it welcomed the \"comprehensive set of actions\" set out by the Swiss authorities. . \"We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today's announcements and will continue to support their implementation.\" . It said the UK banking system was \"well capitalised and funded, and remains safe and sound\". . The UK Treasury also said it welcomed the merger and the British government would continue to engage with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England \"as is usual\". . The FCA said on Sunday it was \"minded to approve\" the takeover to support financial stability as both UBS and Credit Suisse have operations in London.. \"The FCA continues to engage closely with UK and international regulatory partners to monitor market developments,\" the watchdog said.. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said she welcomed the \"swift action\" of the Swiss authorities.. \"They are instrumental for restoring orderly market conditions and ensuring financial stability.. \"The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions,\" Ms Lagarde said. . The comments from the European Central Bank President were echoed in the US.. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell both said the announcement by the Swiss authorities supported \"financial stability\". . \"The capital and liquidity positions of the US banking system are strong, and the US financial system is resilient\", they said.. Credit Suisse has become the latest and most important casualty of a crisis of confidence that has already seen the failure of two mid-sized US banks and an emergency industry whip-round for another. But this is different. Switzerland's second biggest lender was considered one of the top 30 most important banks in the world - which is why this takeover was rushed through by the Swiss authorities. . Although the reasons for each failure differ slightly, the main factor has been a sharp rise in global interest rates which has hit the value of even safe investments that banks keep some of their money in. That has spooked investors and seen the share prices of all banks fall with those considered weakest hit hardest. . The financial authorities in the EU, US and UK are saying they support this deal, stressing that banks are strong and people's savings and deposits are safe. The acid test as to whether this Swiss rescue has calmed nerves in the financial world will be when financial markets open on Monday - which is why it was so important to get this done on Sunday night.. Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern following Sunday night's announcement, UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said Credit Suisse was a \"very fine asset we are determined to keep\".. \"This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue,\" he added.. Mr Kelleher said UBS would be running down the investment banking part of Credit Suisse. . The UBS chairman said it was \"too early\" to say what would happen about jobs: \"We need to do this in a rational way thoughtfully, when we've sat down and analysed what we need to do,\" he said. . The weekend deal comes after an emergency $54bn (£44.5bn) lifeline from the Swiss National Bank on Wednesday failed to reassure markets and Credit Suisse shares tumbled 24%, prompting a wider sell-off on European markets. . The 167-year-old bank is loss-making and has faced a string of problems in recent years, including money laundering charges.  . ",

        "content": "But Democrats have said no-one is above the law and accused Mr Trump of recklessly stoking political divisions.. The case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump's behalf by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.. The 76-year-old is also the subject of several other separate inquiries, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing.. Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted. . It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged or even, beyond the most basic details, what any indictment might contain.. Former US vice-president Mike Pence and the most senior Republican in the US Congress, Kevin McCarthy, have both spoken out against any criminal prosecution. . Speaking to US network ABC News, Mr Pence said Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who is a Democrat, was carrying out a \"politically charged prosecution\" against Mr Trump. . \"I'm taken aback at the idea of indicting a former president of the United States, at a time when there's a crime wave in New York City,\" Mr Pence said.. \"The fact that the Manhattan DA [district attorney] thinks that indicting President Trump is his top priority, I think is, just tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country,\" he told the broadcaster. . In his statement on Saturday Mr Trump called for mass protests from supporters and accused Mr Bragg's office of \"illegal leaks\" to journalists.. Asked about the call for protests, Mr Pence said that US citizens have a \"constitutional right to peaceably assemble\" - but also said any action must take place \"peacefully and in a lawful manner\".. Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy called the investigation \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA\".. In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".. Democrats accused Mr Trump of stirring up political divisions with his claims. . Speaking to ABC News, Democratic Senator Elizbeth Warren said \"no-one is above the law\" even if they happen to have been president and any investigation must be \"allowed to go forward appropriately\".. \"There's no reason to protest this. This is the law operating as it should without fear or favour for anyone,\" she said.. Mr McCarthy's predecessor as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ms Warren's sentiments - adding that Mr Trump's remarks were \"reckless\" and designed to \"keep himself in the news and to foment unrest among his supporters\".. \"He cannot hide from his violations of the law, disrespect for our elections and incitements to violence. Rightfully, our legal system will decide how to hold him accountable,\" she wrote on Twitter.. The Stormy Daniels case centres on how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after he paid Ms Daniels $130,000 before the 2016 US election.. The record for the payment reimbursing Mr Cohen says it was for \"legal fees\". Prosecutors could conclude this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, which is a misdemeanour offence in New York.. ",

There have been allegations that inexperienced staff have been hired based on their personal connections.. The Afghan Islamic Press, based in Peshawar, Pakistan, reported that the decree followed allegations that several senior Taliban officials had appointed their sons to roles within the government.. A photo of the decree was posted on the Office of Administrative Affairs' Twitter page on Saturday.. Afghanistan has faced a deepening economic and humanitarian crisis since the Taliban swept into Kabul and regained control of the country. Foreign military forces had been in the country for two decades, fighting a war that killed tens of thousands and displaced millions more.. Since then, sanctions have been placed on members of the Taliban government, the central bank's overseas assets have been frozen, and most foreign funding has been suspended - cutting off an economic lifeline.. Afghanistan is estimated to be sitting on natural resources - including natural gas, copper and rare earths - worth more than $1tn (£831.5bn), but those reserves remain untapped due to decades of turmoil in the country.. The Taliban government's treatment of women has outraged the international community and increased its isolation while its economy collapses.. Education of women and girls has been particularly contentious. Currently . .. ",

        "content": "Watch: Russia's President Putin tours Mariupol in occupied Ukraine. The BBC has traced part of the route he took, which passed near the locations of several notorious attacks during his army's months-long assault. Russia finally overran the city in May.. Video released by Russian media show Mr Putin chatting to a companion as they head towards the city's concert hall. The Kremlin says the visit took place late on Saturday and Mr Putin decided \"spontaneously\" to tour the city.. Mariupol's Ukrainian mayor in exile Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that Mariupol was \"personal\" to Mr Putin because of what had happened there.. \"We have to understand that Mariupol is a symbolic place for Putin, because of the fury he inflicted on the city of Mariupol. No other city was destroyed like that. No other city was under siege for so long. No other city was subjected to carpet bombing,\" he said. . \"He has come in person to see what he has done,\" he added.. The BBC identified some of the key landmarks along the Russian leader's route. Mr Putin appears to be driving down Kuprina St, turning into Myru Avenue and then into Metalurhiv Avenue, where the Philharmonic Concert Hall is and which he visits later on in the footage. . He is sitting next to a man in a black cap, who Russian media identify as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin. . On his left as they drive down Myru Avenue are sculptures of birds in what was Mariupol's Freedom Square.. Further on, on the right and not shown in the footage, is Mariupol's Maternity Hospital Number Three, which was bombed in a notorious incident last March.. Pictures of heavily-pregnant Marianna Vyshemirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps were widely shared amid outrage at the attack. She survived and gave birth the following day. Another pregnant woman was among the victims.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a war crime but Russia's embassy in London claimed the hospital had no longer been in use, and was instead being used by members of the Azov regiment, which was set up as a volunteer militia with links to the far right in 2014 but had since been incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard.. Mr Putin turned off Myru Avenue just before the road arrives at Theatre Square - the scene of a deadly bombing that is thought to have killed at least 300 and possibly as many as 600 civilians.. Civilians had been using the building as a refuge from the siege and a large sign spelling \"children\" had been daubed in Russian in front of the theatre. The building collapsed when it was hit. Russia denied bombing it and blamed the Azov battalion. In December the Ukrainian city authorities in exile said . . . Russia \"understood where there was a concentration of people, and deliberately destroyed these places, killing people. They systematically worked on this\", said Mr Boychenko.. Footage then shows Mr Putin on a walking tour of a new residential compound, said to be in Mariupol's Nevsky district. He is guided by Mr Khusnullin, who shows him some plans of the reconstruction work. He is also seen talking to people said by Russian media to be local residents and he also visits an apartment that he is told is made up of three rooms. . Nevsky is a new district comprising a dozen apartment blocks in the west of the city. It is named after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands.. Mayor Boychenko said many of the Russian-built buildings were on the city outskirts. \"They built this just to prove that their version of what's happening there is true. But they lie! They lie that they came to liberate the city. But they destroyed it. This city does not exist any longer. And it takes 20 years to restore it!\" he said.. Mariupol residents have been telling the BBC that new buildings are going up and some of those damaged by the Russian military are being removed. The UN estimates that 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in the Russian onslaught.. Norwegian journalist Morten Risberg, who visited Mariupol in December, said he saw \"large-scale rebuilding and restoration\" amid \"destruction everywhere you looked\".. \"They're changing street names and they're painting over Ukrainian colours with Russian colours, and they're putting Russian flags everywhere,\" he told the BBC. Most of the remaining civilians in the city were \"just focusing on surviving\", he said. . In another part of the footage, President Putin is seen walking through the interior of a concert hall in Mariupol. Russian state media said it was the Philharmonic Concert Hall - and the BBC has verified that the footage matches the interior of the venue. . This is the same building that .  was to be used to stage trials of Ukrainian troops who held out against Russian forces for months in Mariupol's massive Azovstal iron and steel plant. Russia finally gained complete control of Mariupol in May after the defenders surrendered.. Images posted on social media in August - including by Ukrainian authorities - appeared to show metal cages being built on the stage. According to the UN, prosecuting prisoners of war (POWs) for taking part in hostilities is a war crime.. But the trials never took place, as the POWs were later part of .  for 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including a pro-Kremlin former MP, Viktor Medvedchuk.. The latest footage from inside the concert hall shows the interior of the building has since been redecorated and the cages are no longer visible.. During the siege the concert hall, like the drama theatre, was used by civilians for shelter. The cultural institutions were \"where people hid in basements and waited for the Russian terror to end,\" Mr Boychenko said.. Before the invasion it had been the venue for the Mariupol Classic festival for classical music. Mr Boychenko said the festival was a \"great celebration of classical music for the people of Mariupol\" that drew artists from abroad and other parts of Ukraine.. \"Many people always gathered at this festival to feel the mood that always prevailed in Mariupol,\" he said.. In a later shot, President Putin is seen visiting a World War Two memorial built to commemorate Soviet troops who recaptured the city from Nazi Germany.. ",
