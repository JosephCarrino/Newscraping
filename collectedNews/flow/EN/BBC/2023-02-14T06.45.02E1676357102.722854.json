        "content": "She and her family asked the BBC not to reveal her precise location; their worry is that there may be repercussions even thousands of miles away from Iran.. Women in Iran are required to wear headscarves in public, even when abroad. But a few are choosing not to, in support of the women and girls spearheading the protests inside the country, following the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September. One of them, the climber Elnaz Rekabi, was forced to recant and it is unclear what her situation is, now that she is back in Iran.. Sara Khadem said there was a slow evolution of her decision to play in the tournament in Kazakhstan in December last year without her headscarf. The contestants only wore them in front of the cameras, and she felt that was hypocritical. Given the sacrifices being made by the women and girls on the streets of Iran, some of them risking their lives, it was the least she could do, she said. . Had she considered joining the demonstrators herself? \"Yes of course,\" she replied. But her young son, Sam, held her back. She said: \"I have responsibilities to him, and I thought perhaps I could use my influence in other ways.\" . Sara Khadem has been playing chess competitively since she was about eight years old. This is not the first time she has fallen foul of the Islamic Republic's strict codes of behaviour.. In 2020, a Ukrainian plane which took off from Tehran airport was shot down by, as it turned out, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, killing 176 people. It was three days before the authorities admitted their error. Ms Khadem said on social media she was planning to leave the national team. She did not mention the flight - nevertheless, she was forced to sign a confession saying she did not mean anything political by her post.. The next time she went to the airport, her passport was confiscated. She thought her career was over.. Now that her life has changed utterly, does she have any regrets? Without hesitation she said no. \"I miss my family, but I would not say I regret the decision. I still represent Iran, and I am Iranian, and the people of Iran still see me as Iranian.\". It struck me that she does not regard herself as political, though she acknowledges that so much in Iran is political. She said, \"I'm not an activist, and I don't have any messages for people risking so much. The people who are protesting in the streets are inspiring to me and so many others.\". Her husband, Ardeshir Ahmadi, is a film director and internet show presenter, who has also had direct experience of being on the wrong side of the Islamic Republic. A documentary film about hip hop resulted in him being beaten and imprisoned for three months. The decision which led to their exile was a joint one. . She has been able to stay in Spain because of the golden visa rule, which allows anyone who buys a property valued at half a million euros (£442,000; $536,000) to gain residency. . Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez invited Sara Khadem to meet him. The day turned out to be bittersweet. . \"It was on that day that I was issued with arrest orders at home. So I had mixed feelings: I was appreciated in this country - and in my own country, where you have achieved lots of success, you get arrest papers.\" . ",

        "content": "President Sandu said the \"plot\" would involve \"protests by the so-called opposition\", aiming to \"overthrow the constitutional order\".. Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain.. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. . Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. . Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use \"saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages\".. The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.. She urged Moldova's parliament to adopt laws to give the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors \"the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats\". She added that \"the Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will fail\".. This video can not be played. Maia Sandu: \"We have the right to choose what we want for our country\" (2020 interview). Moldova's main Socialist and Communist opposition bloc has strong links with Moscow. President Sandu's predecessor Igor Dodon - who ruled from 2016 to 2020 - pursued close ties with Russia.. But since the USSR's collapse in 1991, Moldova has forged a deeper partnership with Romania, an EU member.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, former Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\"..

        "content": "Rescue teams freed him from the rubble of his home in the now devastated city of Kahramanmaras, 105 hours after the earthquake. . When he was brought into the intensive care unit, hypothermia had set in and his body temperature had dropped to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit).. Aras may have survived, but his seven-year-old sister Hiranur did not. Neither did his nine-year-old brother Alp. Nor his father. . Just one of so many families irrevocably broken by this disaster.. Sitting at Aras's bedside and gently ruffling his grandson's dark hair Is Mehmet.. \"He's an honest boy. He has a strong personality. He's sincere. He's not a spoilt boy.\" . Although now 72, Mehmet tells us he will for the rest of his days look after Aras as if he were his own son. . \"The rescuers did so well to save him,\" he says, \"and by God's grace, they gave him back to us alive.\" . Aras winces a little as the doctor changes the bandage on his swollen left foot. He's making a good recovery. . Aras's mum also survived - but he hasn't seen her since their world imploded. She is being treated at another hospital in the city but is expected to recover.. It was in an intensive care unit set up by Israeli doctors where Aras's own life was saved. . But as we walked through the ward on Monday, it was not just a child with a remarkable story but also a 65-year-old man. . Samir from Syria was plucked from the rubble after enduring six freezing nights. . Doctors then saved him, but both his legs had to be amputated. . For the medics at the heart of this disaster it's been an exhausting and traumatic week. . Paediatrician Dr Mehmet Cihan travelled from Istanbul as quickly as he could to help colleagues in this broken city. . \"It's very bad. Too many children have lost their parents. I don't know. It's very hard for me... too hard for me.\". The international medical effort reaches far beyond Kahramanmaras. . In the town of Turkoglu, green British tents pitched by NHS doctors stand alongside Turkish tents with red tarpaulin. . UK doctors are setting up a field hospital in the grounds of the town's hospital which was damaged in the quake. . The need for emergency care in the hours after the earthquake may have passed - but 80,000 people living here are lacking many medical services.. Dr Bryony Pointon is a GP from Chichester, who has come to Turkey as part of UK-Med - a front-line medical aid charity funded by the British government.. \"We are working with the Turkish doctors and nurses that are here - setting up their own tents and seeing patients but they are quite overwhelmed,\" she explains. . \"After all the trauma you have the people who have their usual chronic illnesses - they are still unwell, they don't have the facilities to cope. So, we will see those patients, as many as we can.\". Doctors and nurses from around the world are now in Turkey to help with the physical injuries. . But the mental trauma is also profound - both the personal and the national.. ",
