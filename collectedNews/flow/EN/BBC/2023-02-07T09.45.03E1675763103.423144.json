        "content": "Our building is dangerous’: Quake leaves Syrians homeless. More than 1,400 people have been reported dead so far in northern Syria following the quake.. Emergency rescue teams said many buildings were damaged or destroyed and that people were trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,400 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said families remained trapped under the rubble. . One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP news agency he had lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble.. \"We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,\" he said. \" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery.\". In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region were beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.. Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies. . Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",

        "content": "\"Some want to go to Canada, some want to go to warmer states, and we are there for them as they continue to move on with their pursuit of this dream,\" Mr Adams said.. The New York Post has reported that migrants in New York City are being given free bus tickets to Plattsburgh, New York state, about 20 miles (32km) south of the Canadian border. From there, they pay taxis and shuttles to take them to Quebec. . Quebec immigration minister Christine Fréchette told reporters in Montreal that the development was \"surprising\".. She said it highlighted the need to \"solve the problem of Roxham Road\", referring to an unofficial border crossing south of Montreal used by thousands of asylum seekers every year.. \"I think it makes the urgency of the situation even more apparent,\" Ms Fréchette said, adding that Canada and the US were negotiating to update the Safe Third Country Agreement.. The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada. . But it only applies at official border crossings, which Roxham Road is not. This loophole allows the migrants arriving from New York to have their asylum cases heard by Canadian immigration authorities.. New York City has an ongoing migrant crisis, as states on the southern US border bus newly arrived migrants to America's most populous city.. In a January visit to Texas, Mayor Adams told reporters there was \"no room in New York\" for the migrants. . Days before, he had released a statement saying his city had welcomed 40,000 asylum seekers since last spring, providing them with food, shelter and other resources. . \"We are at our breaking point,\" the statement read. \"Based off our projections, we anticipate being unable to continue sheltering arriving asylum seekers on our own and have submitted an emergency mutual aid request to the State of New York.\". Mr Adams confirmed to Fox 5 on Monday that the city was providing free bus tickets for migrants.. \"If they are seeking to go somewhere else, we are helping in the reticketing process,\" he said..

        "content": "Other energy firms have seen similar rises, with Shell reporting record earnings of nearly $40bn last week.. The profits have led to calls for energy firms to pay more tax as many households struggle with rising bills.. BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was \"helping provide the energy the world needs\" and investing the transition to green energy.. Energy prices had begun to climb following the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply in March last year after Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about supplies.. The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back to about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs. . It has led to bumper profits for energy companies, but also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses. . Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.. The windfall tax only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. The rate was originally set at 25%, but has now been increased to 35%.. Oil and gas firms also pay 30% corporation tax on their profits as well as a supplementary 10% rate. Along with the new windfall tax, that takes their total tax rate to 75%. . However, companies are able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. . BP said its UK business, which accounts for less than 10% of its global profits, will pay $2.2bn in tax for 2022, including $700mn due to the Energy Profits Levy. . Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the windfall tax struck the \"right balance\" between helping families with the cost of living and securing the UK's energy supplies.. \"We've been very clear that we want to  encourage re-investment of the sector's profits back into the economy and that's why the energy profits levy works in precisely the way it does,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . Nick Butler, previously a senior executive at BP and now a visiting professor at Kings College, who the BBC spoke to because of his knowledge of gas companies, said oil and gas prices would not remain \"exceptionally high\" forever. . \"I'm sure there will be more pressure for windfall taxes and I understand that, but this is a temporary situation. Oil and gas prices are going down and the windfall these companies are making won't last until 2023.\". But Labour's shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband called on the government increase the windfall tax. . \"It's yet another day of enormous profits at an energy giant, the windfalls of war, coming out of the pockets of the British people,\" he said. .
