        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large MQ-9 Reaper drone . The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.. Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.. \"I don't know whether we'll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done. And we will certainly work on it,\" Mr Patrushev said.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US also wanted to locate the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. Speaking to ABC America's morning news program, Good Morning America, he added that there were logistical challenges as it crashed in \"very deep water\".. US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", the US said in a statement on Tuesday. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . Ukraine's foreign minister told the BBC incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Dmytro Kuleba said: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place. . \"So the only way to prevent such incidents is actually to kick Russia out of Crimea.\". Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. He told the Ukraine contact group: \"It is incumbent upon Russia to operate its aircraft in a safe and professional manner.\". After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",

        "content": "Argentina has been in economic difficulty for years, and many people now live in poverty.. Its government has been trying to stem price rises by capping the prices of food and other products. . But the food and drink sectors saw the most dramatic increase recent, with prices growing by 9.8% in February compared to January.. Argentinian media said that this increase could partly be due to a sharp hike in the price of meat, which rose by almost 20% in the space of a month. Adverse weather conditions, a prolonged heatwave and a drought seriously impacted livestock and crops, said local news outlet Ambito.. Although the symbolism of the inflation rate shooting up past 100% is striking, the effects of soaring inflation have long been felt in Argentina. . Last September, protesters took to the streets to demand action to counter rising costs of living, and, in February, Argentina's central bank said that.  in response to the jump in consumer prices.. The Argentinian government has long tried to contain inflation, but divisions have marred the country's economic policy. . Last summer, three economy ministers succeeded one another in the space of four weeks as the country's economic crisis deepened, and President Alberto Fernández is said to be at odds with his deputy, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, over how to tackle Argentina's economic problems. . In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. ",

One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted..

Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. He has said he did not appear because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . Mr Khan earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army.

But he endured house arrest at one point for his unwavering outspokenness. . Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide in 2003. Of these, 774 died, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. . Dr Jiang had been working in a Beijing hospital in April 2003, when he was alarmed to hear the Chinese health minister telling the public there were only a handful of cases of a new deadly respiratory disease.. The senior doctor said he knew more than 100 people had Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - in military hospital wards alone.. He sent a letter exposing the lies in the official narrative to Chinese state broadcasters, who ignored it. But the letter was then leaked to foreign media which published his account in full.. His revelations forced the Chinese government to admit it had provided false information, and spurred the WHO into action.. Strict containment measures were imposed overnight, which helped slow the spread of the virus. . His actions also led to the sacking of China's health minister and Beijing's mayor at the time.. \"I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world,\" he said about his actions.. The following year, Dr Jiang again challenged Beijing. He called on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to acknowledge its 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters had been wrong - and that hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians had been killed.. He wrote of his experience working as a surgeon in Beijing on that night. .  how authorities \"acted in frenzied fashion, using tanks, machine guns and other weapons to suppress the totally unarmed students and citizens\".. Ordinary Chinese would be \"increasingly disappointed and angry\" with the CCP's view of the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, he said. \"Our party must address the mistake it has made,\" he wrote.. He and his wife, Hua Zhongwei, were later detained, but Dr Jiang remained for years undeterred on the topic. He wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019, denouncing the Tiananmen Square crackdown as a \"crime\". . Dr Jiang was born in 1931 in the eastern city of Hangzhou to a wealthy banking family and went into medicine after seeing his aunt die of tuberculosis. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, according to South China Morning Post.. Over his lifetime he received several civil honours recognising his public stands, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 2004.. \"He broke China's habit of silence and forced the truth of Sars into the open,\" the award citation read.. Dr Jiang's experience has drawn comparisons with China's initial approach to the Covid-19 outbreak. . Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, was .  after trying to warn people of a \"Sars-like virus\" in December 2019. .

        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis. Mr DeSantis is widely expected to run for president in 2024 and made his remarks in response to questions sent to possible Republican contenders. . The former congressman said continued US support of Ukraine was not among the country's \"vital national interests\".. The comment signalled he would probably scale back aid if he became president.. It also aligned Mr DeSantis with former President Donald Trump, the leading contender for the Republican nomination, who has opposed US support for Kyiv and criticised the Biden administration's handling of the war.. Their comments show the divide in the Republican Party between isolationists who are sceptical of providing military aid and the establishment party policy of supporting Kyiv.. In his response to a questionnaire by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, Mr DeSantis said: \"While the US has many vital national interests... becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\". The 44-year-old has not officially announced his intention to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican nomination, but has been taking all the necessary steps suggesting he will do so.. When asked the same question on whether US backing for Kyiv was vital for Washington, Mr Trump said: \"No, it is for Europe. But not for the United States.\". Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko criticised Mr DeSantis's comments and tweeted his invitation to the Republican governor on Tuesday.. \"We are sure that as a former military officer deployed to a combat zone, Governor Ron DeSantis knows the difference between a 'dispute' and war,\" Mr Nikolenko said.. \"We invite him to visit Ukraine to get a deeper understanding of Russia's full-scale invasion and the threats it poses to US interests.\". While studying law at Harvard University, Mr DeSantis was commissioned as an officer in the US Navy and was assigned to its legal arm, the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps. . His service as a JAG officer included working with detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, as well as an assignment as a legal adviser for elite US Navy Seals deployed to Iraq.. Many Republicans, including the party's senior leadership in the Senate, have long said defending Ukraine is in the best interests of the US. . South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr DeSantis' comments displayed \"a misunderstanding of the situation\" on the part of the governor. . \"This is not a territorial conflict, it's a war of aggression. To say it doesn't matter is to say war crimes don't matter,\" Mr Graham said.. Former Vice-President Mike Pence has also called for the US to increase its support.. But there is a vocal wing of the party - mostly in the House of Representatives - that is hesitant about the continuing aid.. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has supported Ukraine, but recently warned that there \"can't be a blank cheque\" for the country given the scale of US debt.. Politicians from both parties in Congress have voted in favour of Western support for Ukraine, approving more than $112bn (£92.47bn) in 2022 alone.. The US is the largest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent. It pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems, as well as training, logistics and intelligence support. . Humanitarian aid has included food assistance, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other necessities for Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. Financial aid keeps Ukraine's government operating by paying civil servants, healthcare workers and teachers.. ",

        "content": "He is understood to have spent 22 consecutive days in isolation.. Queensland's human rights chief says the case may have broken state laws. . Jack was being held on remand on charges relating to a fight with another 13-year-old boy, at the detention centre some 1,300km north of Brisbane.. He flooded his cell with water from the toilet in desperation at his situation, and after being denied drinking water, his barrister Tim Grau told the BBC.. Describing his detention as \"extraordinary and cruel\", Mr Grau said Jack had \"no serious criminal history\".. \"He was 13, he'd been in court once before. So even for this offending, he was never going to get a period of incarceration, in my view,\" he said.. Mr Grau said he didn't know why Jack spent so long in isolation, but suspected it was due to staff shortages at the prison. . \"If he's being locked in because there's staff shortages, and Cleveland detention centre has 80 or more kids in at any one time, one can only assume that other kids are in the same circumstance. . \"You would hope not, but maybe it's more common than we thought.\". Jack's period of detention included six days being held in adult prisons. He was released last week with a verbal reprimand.. A separate recent case also raised human rights concerns over the Queensland's youth justice system, which is currently undergoing reform. . In February, it emerged that another 13-year-old Queensland boy with developmental disabilities spent 78 days confined to a cell for 20 hours per day.. Queensland is currently debating new laws which would criminalise bail breaches by minors - a change which will cause the youth prison population to increase dramatically, experts warn.. State Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said the recent cases may have breached Queensland's Human Rights Act, which states all prisoners should have access to fresh air and exercise for a minimum of two hours a day.. He warned that changes to the law would only make the situation worse, and that immediate steps were needed to stop children being placed in isolation. . \"Unfortunately, I don't think they're isolated cases,\" he told the BBC. . \"Given the laws that are [being] passed in Queensland, which are clearly intended to incarcerate more children, it becomes even more important that the government urgently develops a coherent plan for preventing children coming within the criminal justice system, \" he said.. \"My concern is by increasing the pressure on the system, we risk normalising the mistreatment of children\".. Mr McDougall urged the state government to \"double down\" on measures to keep children in school and stop them going down \"the path of criminalisation\".. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were 12 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous Australians in 2021, the Queensland Statisticians Office says. . Rates of juvenile incarceration are also high, with Indigenous children accounting for some 70% of detainees across most of Queensland, and over 90% in the state's north. . Overcrowded facilities mean children and minors often have to be housed in adult prisons known as watch houses. Most juvenile detainees are being held on remand. . In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs said solitary confinement or \"separations\" were only used as a last resort. . Youth detention centres were \"complex and difficult environments, and practices used in the centres are designed to ensure the safety of staff and young people at all times,\" the spokesperson said.. \"At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities.\".
