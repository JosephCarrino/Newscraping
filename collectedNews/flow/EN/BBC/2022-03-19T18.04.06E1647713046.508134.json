Indigenous leaders say Ms Frenchman was racially profiled and have demanded the local police chief's resignation.. Two Canadian police officers in the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, have been suspended.. Police responded to reports of a domestic dispute in the early hours of 10 February and found Ms Frenchman standing outside the apartment building, she said. . Ms Frenchman told the officers she had been kicked out of her apartment and feared her 13-month-old son was in danger.. She said the officers told her to wait outside and entered the building, only to return shortly afterwards and say no-one had answered the door.. Ms Frenchman said when she demanded the officers check on Tanner, she was arrested for suspected intoxication. She denies being drunk.. Several hours later police were called back to the same home to reports of a homicide involving a child.. They found Tanner dead and Kaij Brass was arrested. . Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Kyla Frenchman struggled to speak as she demanded justice for her son. Standing with friends and relatives, she spoke of her son as a \"happy baby\" with a big smile. . A statement read on her behalf said she had \"begged and pleaded\" with police to help her and her child after they arrived at their home.. It went on: \"Instead, they accused me of being drunk. They put me in handcuffs and they put me in a cell.\" . A statement from the Prince Albert police department described the boy's death as a tragedy.. It added: \"As an organisation, there is nothing we can say to lessen the grief and torment at this shocking loss of a deeply loved child from our community.\". But Heather Bear, Vice-Chief of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, said: \"If these officers showed up to a domestic dispute call involving a young white family, knowing that an infant was inside and possibly in danger, do you think they would have arrested the mother and left?\". Police have not responded to this allegation.. Earlier this month, the department's chief, Jon Bergen, suspended the two officers involved with pay. . Last week, 95% of the union representing Prince Albert officers supported a vote of no confidence in Mr Bergen's leadership. . Ms Frenchman said in her statement she believed Tanner would still be alive \"if they had listened to me\".. An investigation into the boy's death is ongoing..

Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan.. \"Congratulations on the successful docking,\" a voice from Russia's mission control said moments later.. A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one wearing bright yellow space suits with blue accents.. The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off.. The moment was live-streamed by both Nasa, the American space agency, and the Russian agency Roscosmos.. \"It became our turn to pick a colour,\" Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference.. \"We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it,\" he joked. \"That's why we had to wear yellow.\".

The statistics are impressive: according to Russian officials the Kinzhal can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h. But does that make them any more dangerous than other missiles or even artillery which can cause just as much death and destruction?. \"I don't view it as that significant,\" says James Acton, nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"I don't know how much of an advantage Russia is getting from using hypersonic missiles.\". President Putin boasted last December that Russia was leading the world in hypersonic missiles, which are hard to track because they can change direction in mid-flight.. Russia posted a video of what it said was its missile strike on the arms depot in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100km from the border with Romania.. \"It's a sign of showmanship. Even if it's used we should consider it as an isolated moment because Russia doesn't have a large number of these missiles,\" said Dominika Kunertova of the Center for Security Studies in Zurich.. The Russian leader unveiled the Kinzhal four years ago as one of a series of \"invincible\" weapons that he said would evade enemy defences. The other hypersonic missiles are the Zirkon and the Avangard, which is both faster and has a far greater range.. The Kinzhal can carry a nuclear warhead as well as a conventional one and recent reports said MiG-31 fighters had been sent to Kaliningrad, bringing numerous European capitals within reach. There is no indication from where the attack on the arms depot was launched.. \"It's a signal to the West, because Putin is annoyed that the West is daring to shift all these weapons [to Ukraine],\" Ms Kunertova told the BBC. \"It's questionable that it's so accurate, so it's not a game changer.\". James Acton said the Kinzhal was thought to be an Iskander missile that had been modified for fighter jets, and Iskander-M missiles have already been fired by Russian ground launchers since the start of the war.. Although the Iskander-M has a far shorter range than the air-launched missile, Ukraine's defence ministry claimed this week that .  during the first 20 days of the war. . A US defence official was quoted as saying on Friday that Russian forces had fired more than 1,080 missiles since 24 February.. \"[That] is an astonishing number and a very significant fraction of Russia's pre-war inventory,\" Mr Acton told the BBC, pointing to the increasing use of unguided bombs in Russian aerial attacks. \"They may very well be running short of accurate munitions.\" .

        "content": "Ukrainian officials say Russia attacked the site, which was clearly marked as a civilian shelter. Moscow denies it.. Russian forces have encircled the city, which has no electricity, water or gas.. About 300,000 people are trapped inside, as food and medical supplies run out and Russia blocks the entry of humanitarian aid. Russian attacks have hit a hospital, a church and countless apartment blocks, with local officials estimating that about 80% of residential buildings are either damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. . Mariupol has seen some of the fiercest battles since Russia invaded Ukraine, three weeks ago. The location of the port city, on the Sea of Azov, is strategic for Russia, as it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists, and Crimea, the peninsula it invaded and annexed in 2014.. \"[There is] street fighting in the city centre,\" Mr Boychenko said, confirming a claim made by Russia on Friday, when it said it was \"tightening the noose\" around the city.. \"There are tanks... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,\" the mayor said. \"Our forces are doing everything they can to hold their positions in the city but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.\". Communication with the city is difficult, with the phone network said to be operational only a few hours a day. Amid unrelenting Russian attacks, residents spend most of their days in shelters and basements, rarely coming outside. . Mr Boychenko said, in a previous interview, that there was no city centre left. \"There isn't a small piece of land in the city that doesn't have signs of war,\" he said.. The intense fighting means it is too dangerous for teams to clear the rubble of the destroyed theatre and rescue people from the basement, which withstood Wednesday's attack. \"There's no opportunity to do that,\" Mr Boychenko said. \"When it gets quiet for a bit, rubble is being cleared and people get out.\". He said he could not provide an update on how many had already left the site. A day earlier, the country's human rights ombudsman said 130 people had been rescued, and that about 1,300 remained trapped.. Satellite images showed the Russian word for \"children\" had been emblazoned on the ground in two locations outside the imposing Soviet-era building, indicating the place was being used as a civilian shelter. Most of those inside are elderly people, women and children, who are living squeezed in dark rooms and corridors.. In a video address released on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said some of the people rescued were \"seriously wounded\" but that, at the moment, there was no information of deaths.. President Zelensky also accused Russia of a \"war crime\" for blocking the access of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities. \"This is a totally deliberate tactic,\" he said. \"They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to co-operate with the occupiers.\". The authorities in Mariupol say at least 2,500 people have been killed in the city since the start of the war, although they acknowledge that is an underestimate. Some of the dead are being left on streets, as it is too risky to collect them. Many end up being buried in mass graves.. Mr Boychenko, the Mariupol mayor, said 40,000 people had managed to leave the city in the last five days, and that 20,000 others were waiting to be evacuated. Residents are fleeing in private vehicles, he said, as attempts to create official humanitarian corridors have broken down, with Ukraine accusing Russia of attacking the city despite agreeing to ceasefires..

Russia has an annual defence budget of more than $60bn, compared with Ukraine's spending of just over $4bn.   . At the same time, Russia, and many others, appear to have overestimated its own military strengths. President Putin had embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme for his military and he too may have believed his own hype.  . A senior British military official said much of Russia's investment had been spent on its vast nuclear arsenal and experimentation, that included developing new weapons such as hypersonic missiles. Russia is supposed to have built the world's most advanced tank - the T-14 Armata. But while it has been seen on Moscow's Victory Day Parade on Red Square, it has been missing in battle. Most of what Russia has fielded are older T-72 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and rocket launchers.  . At the start of the invasion Russia had a clear advantage in the air, with the combat aircraft it had moved near the border outnumbering Ukraine's air force by more than three to one. Most military analysts assumed the invading force would quickly gain superiority in the air, but it has not. Ukraine's air defences are still proving effective, limiting Russia's ability to manoeuvre. . Moscow may have also assumed its special forces would play an important role, helping deliver a quick, decisive blow.. A senior Western intelligence official told the BBC that Russia thought it could deploy lighter, spearhead units like the Spetsnatz and VDV paratroopers, \"to eliminate a small number of defenders and that would be it\". But in the first few days their helicopter assault on Hostomel Airport, just outside Kyiv, was repelled, denying Russia an airbridge to bring in troops, equipment and supplies.  . Instead, Russia has had to transport its supplies mostly by road. This has created traffic jams and choke points which are easy targets for Ukrainian forces to ambush. Some heavy armour has gone off road, only to get stuck in mud, reinforcing an image of an army that has become \"bogged down\".. Meanwhile, Russia's long armoured column from the north that was captured by satellites has still failed to encircle Kyiv. The most significant advances have come from the south, where it has been able to use rail lines to resupply its forces. The UK Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told the BBC that President Putin's forces \"have lost the momentum\".. \"They're stuck and they are slowly but surely taking significant casualties.\". Russia had amassed a force of around 190,000 troops for this invasion and most of those have already been committed to the battle. But they have already lost about 10% of that force. There are no reliable figures for the scale of either Russian or Ukrainian losses. Ukraine claims to have killed 14,000 Russian troops, though the US estimates it is probably half that number.  . Western officials say there is also evidence of dwindling morale among Russian fighters, with one saying it was \"very, very, low\". Another said the troops were \"cold, tired and hungry\" as they had already been waiting in the snow for weeks in Belarus and Russia before they were given the order to invade.  . Russia has already been forced to look for more troops to make up for its losses, including moving in reserve units from as far afield as the east of the country and Armenia. Western officials believe it is also \"highly likely\" that foreign troops from Syria will soon join the fight, along with . . A senior Nato military official said this was a sign it was \"scratching the bottom of the barrel\". . Russia has struggled with the basics. There is an old military saying that amateurs talk tactics while professionals study logistics. There is evidence that Russia has not given it enough consideration. Armoured columns have run out of fuel, food and ammunition. Vehicles have broken down and been left abandoned, then towed away by Ukrainian tractors.  . Western officials also believe Russia may be running low on some munitions. It has already fired between 850 and 900 long-range precision munitions, including cruise missiles, which are harder to replace than unguided weapons. US officials have warned Russia has approached China to help address some of its shortages.    . In contrast, there has been a steady flow of Western-supplied weapons going into Ukraine, which has been a boost for its morale. The US has just announced it will be providing an additional $800m in defence support. As well as more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, it is expected to include Switchblade, which is a small, US-developed, \"kamikaze\" drone that can be carried in a backpack before being launched to deliver a small explosive at targets on the ground.  . Western officials still warn that President Putin could \"double down with greater brutality\". They say he still has enough firepower to bombard Ukrainian cities for a \"considerable period of time\". . Despite the setbacks, one intelligence official said President Putin was, \"unlikely to be deterred and may instead escalate. He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine\". And while the Ukrainian forces have shown fierce resistance, that same official warned that without significant resupplies they too could \"eventually be spent in terms of ammunition and numbers\". The odds may be better than when the war first started, but they still seem stacked against Ukraine. . A failing witchfinder and his suspect find themselves on a hellish road trip....

        "content": "Over the next few days, Russia's government social media accounts began to post a video claiming that Olena hadn't been injured at all. . \"Great photos by the way, they were all over the news,\" the Russian narrator says. . The video then claims Olena was photographed two days later, uninjured.. \"A couple of days later, good for her, not a scratch.\" . This claim is baseless, the BBC has .  as genuine, as has . . Wild conspiracy theories like these are not uncommon on social media. . But what makes this conspiracy theory so odd is that it was shared by an official Russian government Twitter account - the Russian Mission in Geneva. Two weeks on, the tweet is still live. . The Russian government has a huge network of official Twitter accounts - the BBC found more than 100 of them. They range from accounts that represent foreign missions or embassies, with a few thousand followers, to those with more than a million followers. President Putin has his own account. Many of the accounts are labelled as Russian government organisations by Twitter.. Yet, while many of these accounts have spread disinformation, Twitter deals with them differently to Russian state media - like RT or Sputnik.. On 28 February, Twitter announced it would prevent tweets from Russian state-affiliated media outlets from being eligible for \"amplification\" - meaning they wouldn't be recommended in the home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. But Twitter has confirmed to the BBC that this policy does not include Russian government accounts. . Tim Graham, a social media analyst at QUT Digital Media Research Centre in Australia, describes this as a \"loophole\" in Twitter's moderation policies, which lets the Russian government pump out misinformation. . \"It's certainly a blind spot in Twitter's defences against disinformation,\" he says. . Intrigued by this spider web of Russian government accounts, Mr Graham - who specialises in analysing co-ordinated activity on social media - decided to investigate further. He analysed 75 Russian government Twitter profiles which, in total, have more than 7 million followers. The accounts have received 30 million likes, been retweeted 36 million times and been replied to 4 million times. . He looked at how many times each Twitter account retweeted one of the other 74 profiles within an hour. He discovered that the Kremlin's network of Twitter accounts work together to retweet and drive up traffic. This practice is sometimes called \"astroturfing\" - when the owner of several accounts uses the profiles they control to retweet content and amplify reach. . \"It's a coordinated retweet network,\" Mr Graham says.. \"If these accounts weren't retweeting stuff at the same time, the network would just be a bunch of disconnected dots. So what the network shows, very clearly, is that there's a very dense amount of connections to the way these accounts are retweeting.. \"They are using this as an engine to drive their preferred narrative onto Twitter, and they're getting away with it,\" he says.. Coordinated activity, using multiple accounts, is against Twitter's rules.. \"You can't artificially amplify conversations through the use of multiple accounts,\" Twitter's rules state.. But Twitter doesn't treat all accounts equally.  Tweets from government and elected officials can be given more leeway when it comes to moderation. The company .  that there may be a public interest in seeing tweets that would otherwise violate its rules. . However, the company doesn't treat official accounts differently when it comes to coordinated behaviour - there is no exemption. . The BBC put Mr Graham's research to Twitter, however the company did not respond directly to his findings. . The BBC also asked the Russian Embassy in the UK about the suggestion that official Russian Twitter accounts behave in a coordinated way - and that many share misinformation. The BBC has not received a response. . On 10 March, the embassy itself tweeted that the bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had been faked. The account claimed that women pictured at the scene were actors. . A photo was posted of a woman being carried on a stretcher, with the words \"FAKE\" plastered over the image. The claim was false. A few days later it was reported that . . . Twitter deleted several tweets making the \"FAKE\" claim, after the BBC flagged them. Yet there are many other examples of Russian disinformation still up on the Russian government's Twitter accounts.. The unfounded claim that Olena Kurilo wasn't really injured is still live - it has been retweeted by more than 20 separate Russian government accounts. . Unfounded claims that Ukraine has bioweapons have been shared by the Russian network and are still up - as are claims of an imminent chemical attack being allegedly prepared by Ukrainians.. The problem Twitter has is that proving content is false can be messy and complex in a time of war. . Savvas Zannettou, who analyses social media moderation at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says war makes policing social media even harder. . \"To effectively moderate is impossible… the information comes at a very rapid pace, and it's coming from all over the place,\" he says. . It appears two things are happening here. Muddled and incomplete information on the ground means only examples of misinformation which are easy to prove are taken down on platforms such as Twitter. . Added to that, Twitter's own public interest exceptions means tweets from government officials can be treated differently from other accounts. The BBC asked Twitter whether tweets from Russian ministries and embassies were included in its public interest exceptions, however the social media company did not respond to this specific question.. Twitter said: \"We've taken numerous enforcement actions on Russian embassy accounts, including requiring the removal of Tweets.\" . Twitter also said it would also be doing more in the coming days to flag accounts linked to the Kremlin. \"We'll be expanding our government account labels to additional Russian embassies to add context for people interacting with these accounts on Twitter.\" . The Kremlin's social media accounts also exist on Facebook and other platforms - this isn't a headache consigned just to Twitter. . In January 2021, after the Capitol Hill riots, Twitter banned Donald Trump for his role in repeating allegations of voter fraud. Twitter argued that repeated disinformation, posted from a position of power, had caused real world violence. . As official Russian accounts continue to post wild misinformation during a time of war, it is perfectly possible that the Kremlin will end up facing another sanction - being frozen out of Twitter. . ..
