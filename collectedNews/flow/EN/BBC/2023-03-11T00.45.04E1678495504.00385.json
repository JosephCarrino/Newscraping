        "content": "Watch: Video appears to show Hamburg suspect firing weapon. He co-operated with officers and there were not enough grounds to take away his gun at the time, police said.. The 35-year-old suspect, named only as Philipp F, had a licence to own the weapon for sporting purposes.. The country is preparing a new law involving tighter curbs on gun ownership, the interior minister said.. Seven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in Thursday's attack which unfolded at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the city.. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) to report that shots had been fired, and officers were on site four minutes later.. Video appeared to show the gunman firing through a window. He then stormed the building where dozens of people had gathered, firing nine magazines of ammunition before apparently turning the gun on himself after police arrived.. Eight people were injured, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. She survived but her unborn baby was killed. . Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the death toll could rise.. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers saved many lives. He described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history.. Officials said the suspect had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member before leaving \"on bad terms\". . Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century.. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members.. On Friday, Hamburg Police Chief Ralf Martin Meyer said officers visited the man in February after they received an anonymous letter claiming he \"bore particular anger toward religious believers, in particular toward Jehovah's Witnesses\".. The letter also said he \"might be suffering from a mental illness, although it had not been medically diagnosed\". . Police said he was co-operative and had an open conversation with the officers. \"The bottom line is that an anonymous tip in which someone says they're worried a person might have a psychological illness, isn't in itself a basis for [such] measures,\" Chief Meyer said.. Forensic experts worked at the scene of the shooting on Deelböge street through the night but have since left the area. . Mourners have left floral tributes near to the front door. One man, holding his little boy and girl by the hand, told the BBC he tried to come home last night but his way was blocked by police wielding assault rifles.. Germany already has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a licence.. In 2021, there were about one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters.. After mass arrests were made last December . , the German authorities have been under pressure to tighten the country's gun laws even further.. ",

        "content": "Prosecutors in New York are investigating alleged hush money payments made on Mr Trump's behalf to Stormy Daniels, a former adult film star who went public with claims the pair had an affair. . Mr Trump denies they had sexual relations.. Meanwhile, the business practices of his family company, the Trump Organization, is being examined by prosecutors.. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, is leading a civil investigation (which cannot result in criminal charges) and has spent years looking at whether the company committed various acts of fraud over several decades.. The years-long criminal investigation, meanwhile, is being led by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and is looking at similar issues.. A member of his legal team told the Associated Press that there was no legal basis for the Stormy Daniels case and he did not believe prosecutors had made a decision on charges.. Separately, the former president and his lawyers have insisted the allegations against the Trump Organization are politically motivated.. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised both Ms James and Mr Bragg.. In the Stormy Daniels case, Mr Trump, has been invited to testify to a grand jury. Experts suggest this indicates he could soon face criminal charges, but it is not clear what these could be.. If prosecutors proceed it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. The criminal Trump Organization investigation has already yielded convictions. The company was found guilty in December of fraud and falsifying business records and fined $1.6m (£1.31m).. In the civil case, Ms James has filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump and three of his children accusing them of \"astounding\" fraud and deception.. The lawsuit alleges that the family inflated their net worth by billions, and is seeking $250m (£226m) that was allegedly obtained through fraudulent means. It's also seeking bans on Mr Trump and his children from serving in a leadership role in any New York business.. The case will be decided by a Manhattan judge later this year.. The Department of Justice is looking into the removal of government documents from the White House, which were then taken to Mr Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. Investigators are assessing how these documents were stored and who may have had access to them.. The former president's sprawling beachside property was searched in August and 11,000 documents were seized including around 100 marked as classified. Some of these were labelled top secret. . Unsurprisingly, we know very little about what's in the documents at this stage. But classified material usually contains information that officials feel could damage national security if made public.. He's denied wrongdoing and criticised the justice department's investigation, branding it \"politically motivated\" and a \"witch-hunt\".. He has offered shifting defences which have mostly hinged on the argument that he declassified the material. No evidence has yet been provided that this is true.. The former president has also argued that some of the documents are protected by \"privilege\" - a legal concept that would prevent them from being used in future proceedings. An independent lawyer is reviewing the seized material to determine if this is the case and that process continues.. But Mr Trump has not directly addressed the key question of why the documents were at Mar-a-Lago in the first place.. This is an active criminal investigation and could result in charges being filed.. Among other statutes, the justice department believes Mr Trump may have violated the Espionage Act by keeping national security information that \"could be used to the injury of the United States\".. And as well as charges relating to the classified documents themselves, prosecutors are also looking at obstruction of justice as another potential crime.. Mr Trump's team are now locked in a legal battle with the justice department over the investigation.. The department has appointed an independent lawyer, or special counsel, to oversee all of its criminal investigations into Mr Trump. Jack Smith will lead its various inquiries and will ultimately decide whether to bring charges.. Mr Trump's alleged role in the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the building in an effort to stop the confirmation of President Joe Biden's election victory, is under scrutiny from several federal government bodies. . The most visible has been a congressional committee that spent 18 months looking into Mr Trump's actions. They held a series of televised hearings laying out their case that his election fraud claims led directly to the riot.. Following these hearings, the committee accused Mr Trump of inciting insurrection and other crimes.. The justice department is running a separate criminal probe into 6 January and broader efforts to overturn the election - but this has largely been shrouded in secrecy. It's the largest police investigation in US history, but the extent to which Mr Trump is a target is unclear.. He's denied responsibility for the riot and criticised the congressional committee, which he described as a \"kangaroo court\" and \"unselect pseudo-committee\".. He has continued to repeat his unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud.. The congressional committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - concluded its hearings by recommending four criminal charges against Mr Trump which it then referred to the justice department.. The move was largely symbolic as it is up to the department to decide whether to file criminal charges. There is no indication this is imminent.. This video can not be played. Watch the moment Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building. The justice department's criminal probe, however, has already led to hundreds of people who stormed the Capitol being charged.. The former president has not been called for questioning in that inquiry, but it remains a possibility. He could also - in theory - be charged if investigators believe there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing.. Prosecutors spent eight-months looking into alleged attempts to overturn Mr Trump's narrow loss in the state in the 2020 presidential election.. The criminal investigation was opened after the disclosure of an hour-long phone call between the former president and the state's top election official on 2 January 2021.. \"I just want to find 11,780 votes,\" Mr Trump said during the call to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger - a reference to the number of ballots needed to give him victory in the swing state.. A grand jury investigating the case was dissolved earlier this year after filing a final report which remains sealed.. He's described the investigation - as he has many others - as a \"witch hunt\".. Mr Trump has also attacked the legal official leading the inquiry - the chief prosecutor of Fulton County, Fani Willis - as a \"young, ambitious, Radical Left Democrat... who is presiding over one of the most Crime Ridden and Corrupt places\".. \"The allegations are very serious. If indicted and convicted, people are facing prison sentences,\" . The 26-member grand jury did not have indictment powers but may have recommended charges.  Among the potential crimes it looked into were the solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government officials, and racketeering.. It is not known whether the former president is being directly investigated, but some of his allies are known to be part of the inquiry.. For a criminal conviction, however, prosecutors would ultimately need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that those involved knew their actions were fraudulent.. In January, a prosecutor working on behalf of Fulton County said the district attorney's office believes the report should only be released after prosecutors determine whether or not to bring charges..

They regard each other as a threatening power that seeks regional dominance. They also support rival sides across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq - and most overtly in Yemen.. Iran has supported Shia Houthi rebels who forced out the Saudi-backed government in 2014, while Saudi Arabia has led a devastating air campaign against the Houthis since the following year.. Saudi Arabia has also accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack it.. In the most serious incident of its kind, drones and missiles struck major Saudi oil facilities in 2019, causing damage and disruption to production. Saudi Arabia and its US ally blamed Iran for the attack - something Iran denied.. Previous attempts at reconciliation have been unsuccessful, but on Friday the two countries said they would reopen embassies within two months. They will also re-establish trade and security relations.. The US cautiously welcomed the announcement. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the administration supported \"any effort to de-escalate tensions in the region\". But he added: \"It really does remain to be seen if Iran is going to meet their obligations.\". UN chief Antonio Guterres thanked China for brokering the deal. .

        "content": "Inviting him to a grand jury indicates he could face charges, experts say. . Ms Daniels says she got $130,000 before the 2016 election in exchange for silence about an alleged affair. . Mr Trump denies they had sexual relations.. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue charges in a case. It is held in secret, and several former aides of Mr Trump have reportedly testified in this case.. If prosecutors proceed, it could be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. The New York Times was the .  Mr Trump had been invited to testify to the grand jury.. If the Manhattan district attorney's office has asked Mr Trump to appear, that indicates the office may be considering indicting the former president, Catherine Christian, a former financial prosecutor in District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, told the BBC. . Mr Trump, she said, is unlikely to accept the opportunity to testify.. \"Most people decline for a host of reasons. You waive immunity, you open yourself up, if you lie, to perjury charges,\" she said. \"You're also letting the district attorney know what your defence is.\". The Stormy Daniels case is one of several cases in which Mr Trump is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. They come as the 76-year-old Republican embarks on another campaign for the White House.. Prosecutors have not commented on news of the invitation, reported in US media and confirmed by Mr Trump's legal team.. The case stems from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair.. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges. Cohen testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (£110,000) just days before the 2016 election. . Mr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. . The former president could face two charges for his actions, Ms Christian said. . The first, she said, could be a straight-forward misdemeanour charge for falsifying business records, as prosecutors allege he listed reimbursements he made to Cohen as legal fees.. The district attorney's office may also seek to charge Mr Trump with a low-level felony, but that presents a much more complicated legal case, she said. . The felony charge would be brought against Mr Trump for falsifying business records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime. . Prosecutors could argue Mr Trump's efforts to hide his payments to Ms Daniels were election campaign related, as he allegedly did so to keep voters from knowing he had engaged in an \"illicit relationship\" with Ms Daniels, Ms Christian said - something she called  \"a novel theory\".. \"That doesn't mean they can't prove it and get a conviction, but it's going to be tough.\". If convicted, Ms Christian said Mr Trump could face probation or a fine. . \"But it would still be a felony, and who wants to be charged with a felony, and who wants to convicted of a felony? Certainly not a former president,\" she said. . On his social media network Truth Social, Mr Trump himself called the investigation a political witch-hunt by what he described as a \"corrupt, depraved, and weaponised justice system\". . Prior to a meeting with the Manhattan DA on Friday, Cohen told media he \"applauded\" Mr Bragg for \"giving Donald the opportunity to come in to tell his story\".  . \"Now, knowing Donald as well as I do understand that he doesn't tell the truth,\" Cohen told the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"It's one thing to turn around and to lie on your untruth social. It's another thing to turn around and lie before a grand jury.\". Legal wrangling over the allegations about Ms Daniels were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency. . A federal inquiry into the Stormy Daniels case was dropped in 2021 after he left office but Manhattan District Attorney's Office has been running a separate investigation since 2018..

        "content": "Its troubles prompted a rush of customer withdrawals and sparked fears about the state of the banking sector.. Officials said they acted to \"protect insured depositors\".. Silicon Valley Bank faced \"inadequate liquidity and insolvency\", banking regulators in California, where the firm has its headquarters, said as they . .. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which typically protects deposits up to $250,000, .  it had taken charge of the roughly $175bn (£145bn) in deposits held at the bank, the 16th largest in the US. . Bank offices would reopen and clients with insured deposits would have access to funds \"no later than Monday morning\", it said, adding that money raised from selling the bank's assets would go to uninsured depositors.. With many of the firm's customers in that position, the situation has left many companies with money tied up at the bank worried about their future. . \"I'm on my way to the branch to find my money right now. Tried to transfer it out yesterday didn't work. You know those moments where you might be really screwed but you're not sure? This is one of those moments,\" one start-up founder told the BBC.. Another founder of a healthcare start-up said: \"Literally three days ago, we just hit a million dollars in our bank account... And then this happens.\". He managed to get the money wired to a different account 40 minutes before the deadline. \"It was pending. And then this morning, it was there. But I know other people who did the same thing minutes after me, and it's not transferred.\". \"It was a crazy situation,\" he said.. The collapse came after SVB said it was trying to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss caused by the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, which had been affected by higher interest rates.. The news caused investors and customers to flee the bank. Shares saw their biggest one-day drop on record on Thursday, plunging more than 60% and fell further in after-hours sales before trading was halted.. Concerns that other banks could face similar problems led to widespread selling of bank shares globally on Thursday and early Friday.. Speaking in Washington on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was monitoring \"recent developments\" at Silicon Valley Bank and others \"very carefully\".   . She later met with top banking regulators, where the Treasury Department said she expressed \"full confidence in banking regulators to take appropriate actions in response and noted that the banking system remains resilient\".. SVB did not respond to a request for comment.. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses, the company is the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It now employs more than 8,500 people globally, though most of its operations are in the US. . But the bank has been under pressure, as higher rates make it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales, and more clients withdrew deposits, moves that snowballed this week. . In Silicon Valley the reverberations from the collapse were widespread as companies faced questions about what the collapse meant for their finances. . Even businesses without direct business were affected, like customers of Rippling, a firm that handles payrolls software and had used SVB. It warned that current payments may face delays and said it was switching its business to another bank.  . SVB's UK subsidiary said it was independent, with a separate balance sheet that is \"ring-fenced from the parent and its other subsidiaries\".. \"We appreciate that this is a concerning time for our clients so we are working tirelessly to support them and give more context,\"  said its EMEA boss Erin Platts.. As well as being a major blow to the tech industry, the collapse of SVB has raised concerns about the wider risks facing banks, as rapid increases in interest rates hit bond markets. . Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply raised borrowing costs over the last year as they try to curb inflation. . But as rates rise, the value of existing bond portfolios typically declines.. Those falls mean many banks are sitting on significant potential losses - though the change in value would not typically be a problem unless other pressures force the firms to sell the holdings. . Shares in some major US banks recovered on Friday, but the sell-off continued to hit smaller firms, forcing trading halts of names such as Signature Bank and others.  . The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day down 1.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4% and the Dow closed 1% lower.. Major European and Asian indexes also closed lower, with the FTSE 100 down 1.6%. . Alexander Yokum, equity research analyst at CFRA, said banks that specialise in single industries are seen as vulnerable to rapid withdrawals, like the one that hit SVB.. \"Silicon Valley Bank would not have lost money if they hadn't run out of cash to give back to their customers,\" he said. \"The issue was that people wanted money and they didn't have it - they had it invested and those investments were down.\". \"I know there's a lot of fear, but it's definitely company-specific,\" he said.. \"The average Joe should be fine,\" he added, but he said tech firms would likely find it even harder to raise money. \"It's not good,\" he said. .
