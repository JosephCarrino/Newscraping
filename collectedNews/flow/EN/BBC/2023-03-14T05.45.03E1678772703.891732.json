        "content": "Joe Biden promised to do \"whatever is needed\" to protect the banking system.. But investors fear other lenders may still be hit by the fallout, sparking sharp falls in share prices globally.. Earlier on Monday, Spain's Santander and Germany's Commerzbank saw their share prices dive by more than 10% at one point. . A string of smaller US banks suffered even worse losses than European counterparts on Monday, despite reassuring customers that they had more than enough liquidity to protect themselves from shocks. . The volatility has led to speculation that America's Federal Reserve will now pause its plans to keep raising interest rates, designed to tame inflation.. Mr Biden said that people and businesses that had deposited money with Silicon Valley Bank would be able to access all their cash from Monday, after the government stepped in to protect their deposits in full. . Many business customers had faced the prospect of not being able to pay staff and suppliers after their funds were frozen.. BBC North America Technology correspondent James Clayton spoke to people queuing up all day outside the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California, to access their funds.. As the bank was no longer offering wire transfers, they were taking out their money in cashier cheques. . Silicon Valley Bank - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by US regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the biggest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. It had been trying to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis. . Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank in New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run.. Mr Biden promised that covering the deposits would not cost taxpayers anything, and instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks.. As part of efforts to restore confidence, US regulators also unveiled a new way for banks to borrow emergency funds in a crisis. . Yet there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another US lender, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms. . Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the stockbrokers AJ Bell, said: \"The first rush of relief has been replaced by niggling concerns that the era of high rates might be more difficult for some banks to stomach than had been previously thought. . \"In the US, bank stocks slid despite Joe Biden's pledge that 'whatever is needed' will be carried out to prevent more dominos from tumbling.\" . The failure of SVB has re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks.. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says there will be a thorough and transparent review of the collapse.. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared.. \"They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,\" he said.. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue \"problematic\".. \"Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,\" he said.. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008.. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered \"too big to fail\". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.  . Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates. . The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates.. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change. . And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen.. ",

It comes just a month after two children were killed when a bus driver drove into a Montreal daycare centre.. Police were called to the latest incident around 15:00 (19:00 GMT) following reports of a collision between a van and pedestrians.. The two people killed are said to be a man in his 70s and another man in his 60s. Canadian media reported that children are among the injured being treated at the local hospital.. Quebec news outlet Le Devoir quoted a local Amqui businessman as saying: \"Amqui is a small place... This is a local tragedy.\" A witness told the newspaper that he saw the truck accelerate as it approached the pedestrians on the pavement. . Quebec police spokeswoman Helene St Pierre said all indications were that this was an isolated event. \"There is no more danger in the area and only one suspect,\" she told reporters.. Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the incident was \"shocking\", while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter that his heart was with the people of Amqui. \"As we learn more about the tragic events that have taken place, I'm keeping everyone affected in my thoughts,\" he said..

        "content": "But the $8bn (£6.6bn) proposal faced a torrent of online activism in recent weeks, particularly among youth activists on TikTok.. Opponents argued it should be halted over its climate and wildlife impacts.. Located on Alaska's remote North Slope, it is the largest oil development in the region for decades and could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.. According to US Bureau of Land Management estimates, that means it will generate up to 278 million metric tonnes of CO2e over its 30-year lifetime - the equivalent of adding two million cars to US roads every year.. CO2e is a unit used to express the climate impact of all greenhouse gases together, as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide.. Monday's announcement will allow only three drill sites for the project instead of the five that were initially proposed - a compromise of sorts with anti-Willow activists.. The approval also comes one day after the Biden administration imposed limits on oil and gas drilling in 16 million acres of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.. Environmentalists had argued Willow is inconsistent with President Biden's pledges to lead on climate action.. More than one million letters of protest were written to the White House, and a Change.org petition calling for Willow to be halted drew more than three million signatures.. \"It's the wrong move and will be a disaster for wildlife, lands, communities, and our climate,\" environmental charity Sierra Club said on Monday.. Sonny Ahk, a young Iñuipat activist from Alaska who campaigned against Willow, said the development would \"lock in Arctic oil and gas extraction for another 30 years and catalyse future oil expansion in the Arctic\".. \"While out-of-state executives take in record profits, local residents are left to contend with the detrimental impacts of being surrounded by massive drilling operations,\" he said. . But all three lawmakers who represent Alaska in Congress, including one Democrat, pushed for the project's approval, touting it as a much-needed investment in the region's communities.. They also argued it would help boost domestic energy production and lessen the country's reliance on foreign oil.. \"This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,\" added ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance on Monday.. The US energy giant, which is already Alaska's largest crude oil producer, will enhance energy security, create good union jobs and provide benefits to Alaska Native communities, he said.. Why has a president who has embraced strong action on climate change just approved a project dubbed a \"carbon bomb\"?. It's because Willow is all about politics and the law - and not the environment. . As a candidate Joe Biden promised \"no more drilling on federal lands, period\". . But under pressure from the courts last year, he authorised plans to sell new drilling leases. Similar pressure from the courts could be at play again.. The Biden administration is obviously aware that, from a purely climate perspective, the project can't really be justified. . So they've tried to balance the approval with new bans on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean. . But most environmentalists aren't buying that trade-off.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. A draft law introduced in the Russian parliament on Monday aims to push back the age bracket for compulsory military service, from the current 18-27 years to 21-30. . Reuters reported that, due to the transition period between the old legislation and the new, 2024 and 2025 would see the conscription age span 10 or 11 years rather than the usual nine - meaning more men would be eligible to fight. . Russia's previous attempt to draft thousands of new recruits into the Ukraine war met with some resistance. In September the announcement of a partial military mobilisation saw .  as men of draft age sought to flee the call-up. . The Kremlin said reports of fighting-age men fleeing had been exaggerated.. Besides the Bakhmut fighting, seven residents were injured elsewhere in Donetsk region on Monday, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line. He added that Russia was bringing more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. ",

        "content": "Joe Biden: \"Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs\". Under the Aukus agreement, Australia will first receive at least three nuclear-powered submarines from the US.. The allies will also work together to create a new fleet using cutting-edge technology, including reactors made by Rolls-Royce in the UK. . The pact is aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. . Speaking with the other leaders in San Diego, California, US President Joe Biden stressed that the boats would not have nuclear weapons and would not jeopardise Australia's commitment to being a nuclear-free country. . Under the deal outlined on Monday, members of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will be embedded at US and UK submarine bases from this year to gain the necessary skills to use the submarines.. From 2027, the US and UK will base a small number of nuclear subs at a RAN base in Perth, Western Australia, before Australia buys three American Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more. . After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies, called SSN-AUKUS. . This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.. The interim and future boats will give Australia submarines which can travel further and faster than its existing fleet, with cruise missiles that could strike targets on land and at sea. . President Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring that the region would remain free and open. He was flanked by the prime ministers of Australia and the UK - Anthony Albanese and Rishi Sunak, respectively. . \"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.. As part of Monday's announcement, the US has also pledged a total of $4.6bn (£3.7bn) over the next few years to build its submarine construction capacity and to improve maintenance of its Virginia-class submarines.. Australia's Anthony Albanese said the submarine plan would create thousands of new jobs and marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".. \"This will be an Australian sovereign capability, commanded by the royal Australian navy and - sustained by Australian workers in Australian shipyards with construction to begin this decade,\" said Mr Albanese.. He also noted that the agreement marks the first time in 65 years and only the second time in history that the US has shared its nuclear propulsion technology.. UK Prime Minister Sunak said that in the 18 months since the pact was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown. . \"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division.\". As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also .  over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states.. The pact has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, last week reiterated Beijing's position that the pact risked creating an arms race and \"undermines peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region\".. \"We urge the United States, Britain and Australia to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game, faithfully fulfil their international obligations, and do more to contribute to regional peace and stability,\" he said.. Touching on the concern about the West boosting its military presence in the Indo-Pacific, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan insisted that Washington had no intention of creating a new Nato-like alliance.. While all three leaders have been keen to stress how the deal will strengthen their co-operation and contribute to global stability, it hasn't been without its political fallout.. In 2021, Australia .  in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris. . The BBC's Phil Mercer, in Sydney, says the deal makes the Australian military more closely aligned with US and UK than ever before.. Australia's government is hailing the deal's strategic importance as well as the fact that it will bring thousands of jobs.. But the country faces some very delicate diplomacy going forward, our correspondent adds.. China is Australia's most important trading partner, and the question will be whether Australia can both strengthen its military ties with US, while fostering greater commercial ties with Beijing.. Aukus will cost Australia up to A$368bn (£201bn) over the next three decades, the government says.. No decision has been made on a future east coast submarine base, although Port Kembla near Wollongong, 100km (62 miles) south of Sydney, is thought to be a likely location.. A local official there said her community was worried by the possibility of a nuclear submarine base close by. . \"It's causing alarm that it could make us a potential military target,\" Greens party councillor Cath Blakey told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. . \"I think it's a potential sovereign risk to Australia to be hitching ourselves to the US and the UK.\".
