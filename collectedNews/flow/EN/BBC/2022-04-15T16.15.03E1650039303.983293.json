        "content": "But he added it was \"intolerable\" for his constituents not to be represented properly while he goes to the courts.. The decision will trigger a by-election for his seat, which had previously been held by Labour for 87 years.. Khan had a majority of 3,358 votes in 2019 in the West Yorkshire seat, which is seen as being part of the Conservatives' Red Wall of former Labour strongholds in the North of England.. Earlier this week, Southwark Crown Court found Khan guilty of groping the teenager at a party in Staffordshire in January 2008.. The jury heard he had forced the youngster to drink gin, dragged him upstairs and asked him to watch pornography before assaulting him.. The verdict saw the Conservative Party expel him \"with immediate effect\". . Khan, who is 48 and has continued to deny the offence, is awaiting sentencing. . If he received a prison term of more than a year, he would be automatically disbarred from being an MP.. Posting on Twitter, Khan said it would not \"ordinarily be appropriate to resign\" while legal proceedings were continuing. . But he added: \"Owing to long delays in the legal process, my constituents have already been without visible parliamentary representation for a year. . \"Even in the best case scenario, anticipated legal proceedings could last many more months.. \"I have therefore regrettably come to the conclusion that it is intolerable for constituents to go years without an MP who can amplify their voices in Parliament.\". It will be up to the Conservative Party when the by-election for his Wakefield seat will be held.. But parliamentary rules state they have to move a writ - the legal process to trigger a by-election - within three months, and the vote has to take place between 21 and 27 days later.. A Conservative spokesperson said: \"Decisions will be made in due course by the chief whip's office.\". During the trial, the victim, who is now 29, said he was \"not taken very seriously\" when he made an allegation to the Conservative Party press office in December 2019, days before Khan was elected as Wakefield's MP. . The victim went to the police days after the election.. Conservative sources told the BBC the party had found no record of a complaint being made about Khan in the run up to polling day.. Khan tried and failed to ban media reporting of the case, with his lawyers arguing that his life could be at risk, as the consumption of alcohol and homosexuality are strictly prohibited within his faith.. But a risk assessment by West Yorkshire police counter-terrorism security advisers concluded that there was \"no objective threat to [the] defendant's life that would arise from being named as the defendant in these allegations\"..

        "content": "The minister - who was appointed to lead efforts to help Ukrainian refugees - said last week there was \"no possibility\" of sending them to Africa.. Under the scheme, single men who arrive in the UK and claim asylum will be relocated to Rwanda. . , Lord Harrington said no refugees had been sent to Rwanda and added: \"If it's happening in the Home Office on the same corridor that I'm in they haven't told me about it.\". On Thursday, he told the BBC that \"hundreds of thousands\" of people were fleeing Ukraine and none of them would be going to Rwanda.. The agreement with Rwanda was announced earlier by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel. . Precise details of how it will work are yet to be confirmed, but the BBC understands the trial will be restricted to mostly single people the British authorities believe are inadmissible.. Rwanda will take responsibility for processing the asylum seekers. If they are successful they will be offered long-term accommodation in Rwanda.. The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, but questions remain about the legality of the scheme.. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the scheme was needed to \"save countless lives\" from human trafficking.. This video can not be played. He said action was needed to stop \"vile people smugglers\", adding the \"humane and compassionate\" plan was designed to break their business model.. But campaigners for refugees and opposition parties have been highly critical of the plans, pointing to Rwanda's poor record on human rights. . At the United Nations last year, the UK demanded investigations into allegations of killings, disappearances and torture.. Amnesty International UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Director Steve Valdez-Symonds described the initiative as \"the very height of irresponsibility\" and \"shockingly ill-conceived\". . He said it would go \"far further in inflicting suffering while wasting huge amounts of public money\".. For Labour, shadow cabinet minister Lucy Powell said the scheme was \"less about dealing with small boats and more about dealing with the prime minister's own sinking boat\".. She called it a \"pretty desperate\" distraction from the partygate scandal.. Ms Powell added that Labour would tackle illegal and dangerous routes of immigration through measures such as making it more difficult for smugglers to advertise online.. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as a \"cynical distraction\". . He said they would not stop people crossing the English Channel in small boats and called for more action against people smugglers.. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon condemned the Rwanda scheme as \"despicable\". She also claimed it was an attempt to distract people from partygate that laid bare the Government's \"moral bankruptcy\". . John Bishop talks maturity and working class representation.

        "content": "The prime minister initially told them no rules had been broken - but he is now among more than 50 people who have been fined by police.. This has led opposition parties to accuse him of misleading Parliament.. Under government rules, ministers are expected to resign if they knowingly mislead MPs.. The ministerial rulebook also says they should correct the record at the \"earliest opportunity\" if they inadvertently tell MPs something incorrect. . Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters on Thursday that Mr Johnson was a \"lawbreaker and a liar\" who has \"no honesty and no integrity\".. Mr Johnson, along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, was fined on Tuesday for attending a birthday party for him in June 2020.. Mr Johnson has since said it \"did not occur\" to him at the time of the gathering that it could be in contravention of Covid lockdown rules.. He is known to have attended at least two further events of the 12 being investigated by police, meaning he could be fined again.. One No 10 aide, who witnessed many of the events under investigation, told the BBC the June 2020 birthday party was the least serious gathering, in terms of potential rule-breaking, that the PM attended.. Alongside staff leaving parties on 18 June 2020 and 16 April 2021, the birthday event is among three events so far known to have attracted fines.. MPs are currently on their Easter recess but are due to return next week. . Asked whether he would put the record straight, Mr Johnson replied: \"You're going to have to wait until I come to Parliament. . \"Of course, I will set the record straight in any way I can.\". On Thursday, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey told reporters the PM had \"clearly misled\" MPs and should be \"sanctioned by Parliament\".. \"Liberal Democrats will be supportive of the Speaker in whatever approach he thinks is best to ensure Parliament can hold this law-breaking, dishonest prime minister to account,\" he added.. It comes amid reports opposition parties could push next week to have the privileges committee investigate whether Mr Johnson misled MPs, a process which could end in him being suspended from the Commons.. The fines for the prime minister and the chancellor are bound to trigger some kind of parliamentary hue and cry, but what, exactly? . The key problem for the opposition parties is that any stratagem they devise will not succeed without the support of 40-50 Conservatives - and very few have broken ranks. . So neither the blunt instrument of a no-confidence motion in the government, a targeted no-confidence motion against the PM, nor the more pointed device of a privilege motion calling for an investigation into whether he knowingly misled Parliament seem, as I write, likely to get through a Commons vote. . This is not to say that the opposition won't want to have a public row, to keep the issue alive, force Conservative MPs to publicly defend their leader, and make it as painful as possible. . But they will also wish to avoid any move that simply consolidates Conservative unity around the PM.. On Wednesday, Lord David Wolfson resigned as a justice minister over the \"official response\" to \"repeated rule-breaking\" within Downing Street. . Opposition parties are calling for the PM and chancellor to resign over their fines - but the two men have been backed by their fellow cabinet ministers.. More than 70 Conservative MPs have also expressed their support for the PM since he was fined, including some who have previously called for him to go.. Since the fines were issued on Tuesday, only four Tory MPs have publicly said that Mr Johnson should quit.. Reports of parties being held in No 10 and other government buildings during lockdowns first emerged in December last year.. Met police initially said they would not retrospectively investigate the allegations unless \"significant evidence\" of a regulation breach came forward.. But they launched an inquiry after civil servant Sue Gray investigated allegations of rule-breaking and passed information to officers.. Her full report will not be released until the Met has concluded its investigation.. When asked whether there was a party in Downing Street on 18 December 2020, the PM told the Commons on .  that \"all guidance was followed completely in No 10\". . After the .  showing No 10 staff joking about the 18 December event, he told MPs on .  he had been \"repeatedly assured\" that \"there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken\".. Later that day, he told the Commons he was \"sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.\". On . , he apologised for attending a Downing Street garden party on 20 May 2020 but said he had \"believed implicitly\" it was a work event..
