Ms Truss, who spoke after talks with her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau, urged G7 countries to go further in their sanctions ahead of G7 and Nato meetings this week.. Measures she is calling for include banning Russian ships from their ports, cracking down on Russian banks, going after industries \"filling Putin's war chest\" such as the gold trade, and agreeing a timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil and gas.. Ms Truss said the only way to end the war is for Russian President Mr Putin to lose in Ukraine and will stress the urgency of stepping up sanctions, as well as giving weapons to Ukraine to defend itself.. \"Although Russian troops have been defeated in their initial assault on Kyiv, there has been no change in their intent and ambition,\" she said.. \"We are seeing Putin's forces set their sights on the east and south of Ukraine, with the same reckless disregard for civilian lives and their nationhood.. \"So far our sanctions have had a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin's war machine.\".

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has outlined a fifth wave of sanctions, including an import ban on Russian coal, which she said was worth 4bn euro (£3.34bn) per year. . Earlier, Ms Truss agreed with her equivalent from Japan, a fellow G7 member, that the international community must increase pressure on Russia with further co-ordinated sanctions.. The UK has also announced a £10m fund to support organisations in Ukraine, including those helping victims of conflict-related sexual violence..

The public anger has prompted nearly all Cabinet ministers to quit, and scores of MPs to leave his government.. Opposition MPs have also rejected his invite to form a national unity government, saying voters want the president and entire government to resign.. But on Wednesday, Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando told lawmakers: \"As a responsible Government, we state President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will not resign from his post under any circumstances.\". On Tuesday night, Mr Rajapaksa lifted controversial state of emergency measures following further protests, the departure of several government lawmakers and the resignation of his finance minister.. The president had invoked the law - which allows the arrest of suspects without warrants - on 1 April after protests outside his house.. But he lifted them on Tuesday in an apparent concession to angry citizens. Earlier that day in parliament, 41 MPs had left the president's ruling coalition to \"represent themselves independently\". The implication of this is still unclear.. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from the UK in 1948.. The heavily import-reliant South Asian nation no longer has enough dollar reserves to buy essential items like food, fuel to power vehicles or even generate electricity. . People have been suffering power cuts of up to 13 hours, massive inflation and a shortage of food and basic goods. . Protests across the country continued on Wednesday. Public frustration over the crisis has seen peaceful demonstrations held since January.. But the situation has escalated in the last fortnight, with many more people taking to the streets as power cuts stretched to 13 hours and petrol stations ran out of fuel.. \"People can't afford their daily rice, their dhal, their basic necessities. People can't get on buses to come to work, to go to school,\" one protester told the BBC this week.. While most protests are peaceful, there have also been violent flare-ups - with attacks on politicians' homes and clashes between protesters and police.. This video can not be played. On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Council expressed its concerns about the emergency measures in a statement issued before they were lifted.. The UN noted the reports of police violence and said it was worried the restrictions aimed at \"preventing or discouraging people from legitimately expressing their grievances through public protests\".. It added that: \"The drift towards militarisation and the weakening of institutional checks and balances in Sri Lanka have affected the state's ability to effectively tackle the economic crisis.\".

        "content": "Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, had claimed the \"Oh I\" hook in Sheeran's track was \"strikingly similar\" to an \"Oh why\" refrain in his own track.. After the ruling, Sheeran said such \"baseless\" claims \"are way too common\".. In a video on social media, he said there was now a culture \"where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim\".. He added: \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music.. \"Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year and there's only 12 notes that are available.\". Shape of You was the UK's best-selling song of 2017 in the UK and is Spotify's most-streamed ever.. Judge Antony Zacaroli ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song.. He acknowledged there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\" in Shape of You and Oh Why, but said \"such similarities are only a starting point for a possible infringement\" of copyright.. After studying the musical elements, he said there were \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs, which \"provide compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".. He added that there was only a \"speculative foundation\" for the defence's case that Sheeran had head Chokri's song before writing Shape of You. \"I find, as a matter of fact, that he had not heard it,\" he said.. Sheeran wrote his chart-topping track with two collaborators, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, who all denied having previously heard Oh Why.. The case dates back to 2018, when the trio asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed the copyright of Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. That led to an 11-day trial in London last month.. This ruling will come as a huge relief to Ed Sheeran, who took the unusual step of pre-emptively suing Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue in 2018 in an attempt to clear his name. . He was stung by the accusation that he'd deliberately copied another writer's work without giving them credit. On the witness stand, the star was often terse and abrupt as he explained how, in several other instances, he shared royalties with writers who inspired him. Even on Shape of You, he protested, some of the profits went to the writers of TLC's No Scrubs.. He later sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good and Blackstreet's No Diggity on the stand in an attempt to prove the melody he was accused of stealing was commonplace in pop music.. Chokri was more emotional. He said he felt \"robbed\" by an artist he respected, and that he wished the trial had never come to court. However, he remained adamant that Sheeran had heard and copied his song.. In the end, the judge disagreed. In order for copyright infringement to be proved, Chokri needed to prove that Sheeran had listened to his song - otherwise the similarities would just be coincidence. But Mr Justice Zacaroli said Mr Chokri's team had failed to establish that Oh Why had ever graced Sheeran's speakers. . As a star who has faced his fair share of copyright claims, Sheeran will presumably hope this verdict makes future litigants think twice. . The Shape of You songwriters took legal action in 2018 after the track's royalties were frozen when Chokri and O'Donoghue asked the Performing Rights Society (PRS) to be added to the hit's credits as co-writers.. Shape of You earns Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon about £5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments having being frozen due to the dispute.. In his ruling, Mr Justice Zacaroli said Sheeran and his collaborators were justified in thinking the request from Chokri and O'Donoghue to be named as co-writers \"was a tactic designed to extract a settlement\".. After the initial legal action, Chokri and O'Donoghue launched a counter-claim alleging copyright infringement.. In a joint statement after the judgement, Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon said their mental health and creativity had suffered as a result of the case, as well as their wallets.. \"There was a lot of talk throughout this case about cost,\" they said. \"But there is more than just a financial cost. There is a cost on creativity. When we are tangled up in law suits, we are not making music or playing shows.. \"There is a cost on our mental health. The stress this causes on all sides is immense. It affects so many aspects of our everyday lives and the lives of our families and friends. We are not corporations. We are not entities. We are human beings.\". Giving evidence last month, Sheeran denied that he \"borrows\" ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement, insisting he was always \"completely fair\" in crediting people who contribute to his work.. Andrew Sutcliffe QC, representing Chokri and O'Donoghue, labelled Sheeran a \"magpie\", claiming he \"habitually copies\" other artists and that it was \"extremely likely\" he had previously heard Oh Why.. In closing arguments last month, Mr Sutcliffe said there was an \"indisputable similarity between the works\". But Sheeran's lawyer said the case against him was \"so strained as to be logically unintelligible\".. Forensic musicologists were called by both sides to argue the case, . . One said the songs were \"distinctly different\" but the other argued they contained \"significant similarities\".. Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, said .  for the star and his collaborators, while Chokri described the High Court case \"the worst few weeks of my life\"..

On Tuesday it was announced that he had been appointed to Twitter's board.  . The poll has already attracted over four million votes.. Twitter initially said it was exploring an edit button on 1 April but it was widely interpreted as an April Fool's joke.. Twitter says it was already working on an edit button before Elon Musk was appointed to its board. . But it does certainly look like the Tesla boss has moved the process along. . Twitter polls are notoriously unscientific - yet Mr Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results. . In November last year, he asked his 80 million followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll concluded he should, and he did. . Mr Musk's poll on whether there should be an edit button on Twitter is being taken seriously by the chief executive of Twitter. \"The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,\" Parag Agrawal said.. It certainly suggests that Twitter will now look to change its policy in this area as a consequence of the poll result. . Mr Musk overnight has generated huge influence over Twitter - and he seems to be giving his followers the ability to choose what approach he takes. . This was day one remember, who knows what else he might do in this new powerful position.. This video can not be played. The award-winning series, Gentleman Jack, is returning!.

        "content": "Mr Nazir was a partner at a law firm working in Singapore, where his family moved more than a decade ago. . His firm said he was a \"dear friend and colleague\".. Watson Farley & Williams said they would be \"remembering and honouring\" him.. The alarm was raised on Monday afternoon by the family's 15-year-old daughter after the landslide killed her father and younger brother, leaving her mother and older brother critically injured.. The teenage girl was said to be \"extremely distressed\" and is being kept in hospital under observation.. The two bodies were recovered from the mountains, near the popular walking spot of Wentworth Falls, about 60 miles (96km) from Sydney, at about 09:30 local time on Tuesday.. Tour guide Graham Chapman said landslides are common in the Blue Mountains and have been made more likely by recent heavy rain.. \"This beautiful family from England were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's so sad,\" he said.. \"Maybe another 50 metres either side or a delay during the day, this wouldn't have happened.\". Torrential rain has returned to the Blue Mountains. Thick bands of low cloud have moved in, obscuring buildings and bushland.  . As the rain beats down near Wentworth Falls, car headlights occasionally emerge from the mist. But this popular tourist destination is mostly quiet: walking tracks and some roads have been closed. . Months of heavy downpours are likely to have been a key factor in the tragedy involving the family of five from Britain. . They came on a day of rare sunshine in a year that's been dominated in much of eastern Australia by storms and floods. . In this World Heritage area, the ground is sodden and signs warn of the dangers of rockfalls and landslips. The earth and the famous sandstone cliffs have become saturated, and still it rains. . Landslides here are not uncommon - but rarely, if ever, have they devastated the lives of an entire family. . The family had set out on the hike on Monday in bright, sunny weather but the Blue Mountains had previously been lashed by weeks of heavy rain.. Mr Chapman said: \"I've seen so many landslides I couldn't tell you how many. But the thing is with landslides here in the mountains, you don't actually get to hear about them a lot because it's so remote.. \"Here in the mountains, it can change in the blink of an eye and sadly for the English family, that's exactly what happened the other day.\". He said he had cried when he heard the news of their deaths, adding: \"We've only just opened up our international borders, and to know that that family has come to our country and that this has happened on our soil, man, it's just heart breaking.\". The family are understood to be members of the Zoroastrian religion, . .. Zubin Appoo, president of the Australian Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales, said the accident was \"beyond tragic\". \"Everyone is shocked and so many in our community are reaching out to offer support in any way they can.\". Mr Appoo said tributes to the family were \"flooding in\", adding that the religion had a small and tight-knit global community.. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident was \"tragic\" and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open.. The Department of Environment and Heritage in the state said the area was closed to the public until further notice and a \"comprehensive review\" would be undertaken.. It said it had a \"world-class\" programme in place to assess the risks of incidents such as landslides but \"it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks\".. The walking trail had been inspected days before the landslide as part of a routine assessment, the department said.. The award-winning series, Gentleman Jack, is returning!.

        "content": "The soldiers took Oleg out beyond the gate onto the pavement, Volodymyr said, and threw a grenade in through the front door of the house that exploded with a deafening bang and set the house on fire.. Volodymyr grabbed a small fire extinguisher and tried in vain to extinguish the flames. \"Where is Oleg? Oleg will help!\" he shouted to his daughter.. But the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said.  . \"Oleg will not help you anymore.\" . They found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed.. The killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet.  . Russia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control.. The Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov \"did not ask him anything\", his wife Iryna said. . \"They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,\" she said. \"They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him.\" . She wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate.  . \"Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,\" Volodymyr said. \"Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke.\". Volodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. . But exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. \"I have no idea how we are going to find it now,\" he said.. Ukrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. . Along one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road.  . \"I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,\" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. \"What you see here is animal cruelty,\" he said. . Addressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg.  . \"The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,\" he said. \"They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.\". Ukraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far.  . There are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. . \"He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,\" Volodymyr said.  . \"Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.\". The award-winning series, Gentleman Jack, is returning!. Take a peek at the gruelling challenges they'll face!.

        "content": "The US is also planning more sanctions.. And UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for a \"tough new wave\" of sanctions from G7 and Nato ministers.. She said her Japanese counterpart had agreed the international community had to increase pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin \"and his war machine with further co-ordinated sanctions\".. EU officials had earlier indicated the focus would be on enforcing existing measures. . But revelations of atrocities, with hundreds of bodies of civilians found in towns abandoned by Russian troops, have given added impetus for new measures. . \"The new sanctions will probably be adopted tomorrow,\" French European Affairs Minister Clément Beaune said on Tuesday.. Ms von der Leyen said the proposals included:. The EU was also working on other sanctions including on imports of Russian oil, she said.. This is the fifth set of EU sanctions so far. Earlier measures have ranged from individuals including Vladimir Putin and hundreds of Russian MPs, to the financial and energy sectors. The 27 member states plan to cut use of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year and then make Europe entirely independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030.. There is an active debate in Germany on imposing a total embargo on Russian energy, but the government warns it would trigger a recession and mass unemployment and for the moment it has ruled it out. \"If it would stop the war, then we would do it immediately,\" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.. Germany relied on Russian gas for 55% of its imports last year, while for the EU as a whole it was 40%.. Experts widely agree that sanctions agreed by the West until now are unprecedented but Eddie Fishman rates them at \"seven or an eight of 10 in intensity\". He was a lead official in the US State Department in 2014 when sanctions were drawn up in response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.. \"Oil remains the life-blood of Russia's economy,\" he argues. \"Putin has made billions of dollars since the war began and Russia's oil sales remain very strong.\" . The EU's latest proposals tighten sanctions on four Russian banks. Although major Russian banks have been shut out of the Swift financial messaging system, two of the biggest are not. . Again, it's energy-related. Sberbank and Gazprombank facilitate energy payments from Europe to Russia.. Lithuania announced that from the start of this month it had put a stop to all Russian gas imports. . \"Look friends, you can do the same,\" President Gitanis Nauseda told his EU counterparts. It had become possible through investment in liquified natural gas and electricity link infrastructure, he explained.. But could the EU, as a whole, really turn off the taps to Russian energy?. There have been warnings of factory closures, jobs losses and plummeting public consent for sanctions. . You would have to pray for warm and windy weather, says Jacob Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund. Warm to lessen the need for heating homes - and windy to power Europe's electricity generating turbines.. And while Mr Kirkegaard agrees with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that a ban could trigger a recession, he believes the blow to Russia would be worse. . \"The Russian government would, in my opinion, be compelled to start printing large amounts of new roubles with the risk of inciting significant additional inflation in Russia.\" . Beyond energy, sanctions so far have hit Russia's tech, aviation and finance sectors, as well as its oligarchs - the wealthy Russians who made their fortunes under President Putin's patronage. . But, as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reminded Belgian lawmakers in an address last week, there are other awkward areas where business goes on. . Rough diamonds are still moving from Russia to Antwerp and sea ports remain open to Russian shipping.. So while trade ties between the EU and Russia have been seriously frayed, strained but lucrative connections remain.. An energy embargo remains the \"ultimate\" economic severance weapon, and Germany is usually cited as the main obstacle to that. But other countries are accused of hiding behind Chancellor Olaf Scholz's frank assessments.. \"Germany is really afraid of what might happen to its economy,\" says Prof Karen Pittel, a director at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich.. \"But in principle, if it happens tomorrow, then we'll survive it.\" . She also believes that the outlook has shifted after President Putin began demanding payment for gas in roubles. Germany refused but Prof Pittel says it's possible there may come a time when Germany has no other choice than to abandon Russian energy.. It still seems extremely unlikely that Europe will be cut off from Russian supplies in one, big dramatic move, but pressure is mounting.. \"Clear and determined sanctions are necessary. These sanctions are not working,\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this week.. Until recently, the idea of an energy embargo would not have just seemed unlikely. It would have been unthinkable.  . The award-winning series, Gentleman Jack, is returning!. Take a peek at the gruelling challenges they'll face!.
