It comes amid fears that Beijing could face a similar situation to Shanghai, which has seen some 25 million people shut in their homes for weeks. . All 3.5 million residents in Chaoyang, Beijing's most populous district, will undergo three rounds of mass testing, according to a notice by the city's disease prevention team. . The news prompted residents to rush to stock up essential supplies, with images circulating on local media showing supermarket shelves emptied of goods and snaking queues at check-out counters. .

On Saturday, dive teams searching for Mr Evans were forced to halt their operations due to strong currents. Rescue operations resumed on Sunday morning. . Mr Evans was assigned to Operation Lone Star, a border security operation announced by the state's Republican governor Greg Abbott last year. . The multi-billion dollar operation has seen thousands of state troopers and members of the Texas National Guard deployed to secure the state's 1,200 mile (1,920km) border with Mexico. .

        "content": "The retired four-star general said the US will allocate an extra $713m (£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and 15 other central and eastern European nations.. Mr Austin was speaking after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.. Accompanied by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. . The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. . At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".. The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believe Ukraine can win the conflict \"if they have the right equipment\" and the \"right support\". . Mr Putin appeared to seize on Mr Austin's comments during a speech on Monday and accused the West of trying to \"split Russian society and destroy Russia from within\". . The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. . Meanwhile, US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (£260m) will be allocated to Ukraine. . It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (£2.9bn). . Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles.. Last week the US confirmed that it has supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. . Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. . Meanwhile, Mr Blinken announced that some US diplomatic staff will start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv in western Ukraine initially, with a longer term plan to re-open the US embassy in the capital, Kyiv. . It comes as the White House announced that President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. . Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration has assembled has pressure on President Vladimir Putin's regime. . \"The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,\" Mr Blinken said. \"And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding.\". \"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,\" Mr Blinken added. . Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated \"the unprecedented assistance\" from Washington and added that he \"would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine\". . President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. . But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US Defence Secretary. . America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. . More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. . Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. . To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China.  . For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. . In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. . On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow has made minor advances in the region but has \"yet to achieve a breakthrough\" due to logistical issues. . The update claimed that \"Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness\". . Gary Lineker on football, politics and road rage.

        "content": "Yes, presidents have retained the Elysée before. But both François Mitterrand in 1988 and Jacques Chirac in 2002 were effectively in opposition in the period running up to the vote.. In both cases, actual government was - as a result of mid-term parliamentary elections - in the hands of the president's foes. Though in office, Mitterrand and Chirac were politically impotent - but that helped when the wheel turned again and they found themselves back in favour.. As for Charles de Gaulle's victory in 1965, he'd never been elected by the people in the first place. . So, Emmanuel Macron is the first president in modern times who, after running every aspect of foreign and domestic policy for a full term, has once again won the trust of the people.. When you consider France's longstanding relationship with government - which is essentially to cheer 'em in, then chuck 'em out at the first opportunity - this is no mean feat.. He has done it by two methods, the first of which bodes well for the next five years, the second less so.. The results suggest that hidden beneath the seething mass of social media caricatures - the arrogant Parisian rich, the angry provincial mob - there are millions of French people of the middling type who feel that Emmanuel Macron has not been at all a bad president.. These people appreciate that unemployment is no longer a political issue, largely because of Macron's reforms. They think his handling of Covid was competent, and they agree that pushing back the age of retirement is inevitable.. They also discern a leader who can more than hold his own on the international stage. They are glad there is someone at the Elysée with the stature to talk straight with Putin, even if it proved a fruitless endeavour.. And they reckon that under Macron France can aspire to take the lead in Europe, at a time when his vision of greater military and economic autonomy for the EU is looking more and more relevant. The contrast on this front with Marine Le Pen could not have been starker.. These people may not particularly like Emmanuel Macron - he's too different - but enough have come to respect him.. However, the second aspect of the Macron methodology is more problematic - and this is where the caveats come in. . Five years ago, Macron made a brilliant gamble about the state of modern politics. . By straddling the centre, he destroyed the old pairing of conservatives and social democrats, and using the powers implicit in De Gaulle's Fifth Republic, he installed a highly personalised and highly concentrated system of government from the Elysée.. Opposition was forced to the \"extremes\" of left and right, where he trusted they could never really pose a threat. So far he has been proved right, as this election shows.. This video can not be played. But the election has also demonstrated something else: that more and more people in France are now prepared to dally with the \"extremes\". They do it because - thanks to the successful Macron revolution - there is nowhere else for them to go if they want to oppose him.. Many of these voters - especially the millions who chose the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon - now want their revenge on the newly re-elected head of state. . They hope they can do it at the parliamentary elections which will take place in June. But if that does not work, they dream of a social \"third round\" in September taking the form of anti-Macron demonstrations on the street, especially if he has by then launched a new wave of reforms.. Emmanuel Macron will no doubt start this second term promising a new kind of government. He'll be more of a listener. He knows there are wounds that need to heal. The trouble is that he has said that kind of thing before, and a lot of people simply don't believe him.. \"Not only has this election shown that there are two opposing Frances out there. It's also revealed a growing tendency for people to say that the opposite camp is not legitimate,\" said commentator Natacha Polony.. \"In the past elections always ended with someone who people recognised as president of all the French. I'm not sure that is the case any more.\". Gary Lineker on football, politics and road rage. Searching for Vladislav Surkov, key architect of the 'post truth' world.

The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a \"president for all\".. He is the first sitting president in 20 years to be re-elected.. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen, 53, said her significant vote share still marked a victory.. The ideas her National Rally represented had reached new heights, she told her supporters. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had ultimately failed, just like her father who preceded her: \"It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat.\" . Marine Le Pen took over the party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 in a bid to make it electable. She won more than 13 million votes on Sunday, on a platform of tax cuts to tackle the high cost of living, a ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in public and a referendum on immigration controls.. \"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,\" Mr Macron said in his victory speech. \"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me.\". More than one in three voters did not vote for either candidate. . , the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969, and more than three million people cast spoilt or blank votes.. Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. Voters who said they were casting blank ballots told the BBC they wanted to punish the sitting president.. Anti-Macron demonstrators rallied in a number of cities, including Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, refusing to accept the result. . In his speech Mr Macron, 44, said his government would have to \"answer their choice to refuse to choose\". . Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. . While it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, he claimed that Mr Macron had been elected with a worse result than any other president. \"He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots.\". Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who had feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. . German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was first to congratulate him, singling out their mutual challenge in responding to Russia's war on Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also said he looked forward to \"close co-operation\" including on supporting Ukraine.. This video can not be played. While Mr Macron has played a key diplomatic role in the war, Marine Le Pen has struggled to shake off accusations of ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated him as a \"true friend\" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe. . UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.. Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars. . Accompanied by his wife Brigitte and leading a group of children, he walked to the stage accompanied by the EU anthem Ode to Joy before promising supporters that \"no-one will be left by the wayside\". Addressing voters who had backed him to keep the far right out of power he said he would be indebted to them for years to come.. The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich.. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message, when France was going through a considerable crisis involving \"many divisions and a lack of understanding\". . Mr Castex is now likely to be replaced in the next few days, and Mr Macron may ask Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne to take over. She refused to say whether she had been lined up to be the next prime minister, insisting that the focus had to be on dealing with people's worries about living standards. But a ministerial colleague, Clément Beaune, said the president was definitely keen on having a female prime minister.. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight and one opinion poll suggests 63% of voters want him to lose his majority.. If that happened, he would be forced into a \"cohabitation\" with a government led by other parties.. Mr Mélenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. . In her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the \"match is not completely over\" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high.. For now there is no talk of a change of leadership in her National Rally party. \"Everything will be rebuilt around her, she's at the head of this popular and social bloc,\" spokeswoman Laure Lavalette told French TV..
