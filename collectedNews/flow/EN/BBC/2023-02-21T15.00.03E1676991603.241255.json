        "content": "It has now said not enough progress has been made to allow full access. . The Australian government has expressed disappointment at the cancellation.. The SPT, which is made up of independent human rights experts, was supposed to check Australia's adherence to a protocol aimed at preventing torture and degrading treatment. . The country's involvement in this was approved by the federal government in 2017 and allows SPT members to visit prisons, police stations and other detention centres unannounced.. But SPT Chairperson Suzanne Jabbour has said that despite Australia's co-operation, there was no alternative but to \"terminate the visit as the issue of unrestricted access to all places of deprivation of liberty in two states has not yet been resolved\".. The SPT added that it \"could not ascertain that it would be able to resume its visit in a reasonable timeframe\".. A spokesperson for Australia's federal Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said the government deeply regretted the decision and that it doesn't reflect the country's \"commitment to protecting and promoting human rights\".. He added that SPT visits in all other Australian states had been successful. . Since October, Queensland has made some progress in allowing the UN to visit mental health in-patient wards, access to which had been blocked over privacy concerns.. A bill aimed at removing legal barriers is currently being examined by parliament. . New South Wales Attorney General Mark Speakman has said his government had \"consistently indicated\" it supported the protocol. . The state restricted access to prisons in October, with the corrections minister telling local media at the time that officers at one facility had been right to deny inspectors access as they didn't have proper approval. . \"It's really unnecessary for the UN to demand to come and demand to get into our jails,\" said Geoff Lee, adding that the state had nothing to hide. . Australia's human rights commissioner, meanwhile, has said the visit's cancellation was \"neither unexpected or undeserved\".. Lorraine Finlay told ABC News that Australia hasn't treated the issue with the seriousness it deserves.. \"I think there's no doubt that it does damage our reputation,\" said Ms Finlay.. \"Australia wants to be a global leader when it comes to human rights, but it's really hard to take on that leadership and advocate… when we're not meeting our own international commitments.\".

The design fault was made public earlier this month. . The Spanish government says the mistake was spotted early enough to avoid financial loss. However the region of Cantabria has demanded compensation. . Renfe ordered the trains in 2020 but the following year manufacturer CAF realised that the dimensions it had been given for the trains were inaccurate and stopped construction.  . The rail network in northern Spain was built in the 19th Century and has tunnels under the mountainous landscape that do not match standard modern tunnel dimensions. . The mistake means the trains will be delivered in 2026, two years late. . Renfe and infrastructure operator Adif have launched a joint investigation to find out how the error could have happened. Earlier this month, Spain's transport ministry fired a Renfe manager and Adif's head of track technology over the blunder.. ",

A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and 31 subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit.. Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP news agency he had been looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquakes when the latest tremors hit. . \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall,\" he said. . In the city of Adana, the latest earthquake drove people to a volleyball centre that had been converted into a rescue centre following the first earthquake.. The authorities have told the BBC they believe as many as 600 people may have arrived overnight - seeking a sturdy, ground-level building in which to take shelter.. When the quake struck, people were reported to have run out into the streets rather than staying put, reflecting the fact that there is still significant fear two weeks after the initial disaster. . In Syria, some 470 injured people are said to have visited hospitals after Monday's quakes, which were also reportedly felt in Egypt and Lebanon. . In a visit to Turkey on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid, saying that America would help with earthquake recovery \"for as long as it takes\".. It is one of several countries to have offered their help in the wake of the first earthquake. . Rescue operations had .  in all but two areas, with hopes of finding people alive fading fast. .
