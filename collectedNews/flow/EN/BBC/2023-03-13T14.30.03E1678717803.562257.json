        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. ",

        "content": "WATCH: Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis make emotional speeches. Sunday's ceremony was an opportunity for Ke Huy Quan to catch up with his old friend Harrison Ford.. Quan, who starred alongside Ford in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was a child, won best supporting actor for Everything Everywhere All at Once following a two-decade break from performing.. After . , he excitedly ran up to the stage and embraced his former co-star, who presented the award.. Lady Gaga made sure her vocals were centre stage when she performed without make-up and wearing jeans and a plain T-shirt.. The look for her performance of Hold My Hand, nominated for best original song, was a stark contrast to her earlier appearance on the not-so-red carpet, in a black Versace dress with a sheer corset bodice.. While on the carpet, she received praise from fans on social media for rushing to the aid of a photographer who appeared to have fallen when walking past her.. British actor Hugh Grant's humour was a hit with the crowd at the Dolby Theatre.. When presenting the award for best production design with his Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star Andie MacDowell, Grant joked: \"The purpose of this is two-fold.. \"The first is to raise the vital importance of a good moisturiser. Andie has used one every day of her life, I have not.\" . Grant then gestured to MacDowell, saying: \"Still stunning.\" He then gestured to himself: \"Basically a scrotum.\". Earlier in the evening, Grant seemed less enthused as he spoke to model Ashely Graham about his cameo appearance in the film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.. Asked about his experience filming the sequel, he replied: \"Well I'm barely in it. I'm in it for three seconds.\". Probed further about whether he enjoyed filming it, he replied: \"Almost.\". When presenting the In Memoriam tribute for Hollywood figures who have died last year, John Travolta offered an emotional tribute to his Grease co-star Olivia Newton John. . \"We remain hopelessly devoted to you,\" Travolta tearfully said, referencing the iconic song by Newton John.. The late-night talk show host returned to host his third Academy Awards ceremony. He quickly addressed last year's Oscars controversy, when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage. . \"We want you to have fun, feel safe and, most importantly, we want me feel safe. So, we have strict policies in place,\" Kimmel said.. \"If anyone in this theatre commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute long speech.. \"But seriously, the Academy has a crisis team in place,\" he added. \"If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the show, sit there and do absolutely nothing. Maybe even give the assailant a hug.\". In an ode to the Irish film Banshees of Inisherin, Kimmel later brought a donkey on stage. . \"She's a certified emotional support donkey. At least that's what we told the airline to get her on the plane from Ireland. If you're feeling sad or need a hug... Let's get you back on that Spirit Airlines flight now.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Kimmel kicks off Oscars with Will Smith joke, then brings out a donkey. Elizabeth Banks presented the award for best visual effects - accompanied by a very hyperactive grizzly.. \"I recently directed the film Cocaine Bear and without visual effects, this is what the bear would look like,\" Banks joked. . The directors of best short film, An Irish Goodbye, used their acceptance speech to sing a rendition of Happy Birthday to one of the film's stars, James Martin.. After saying their thank yous, director Ross White said: \"This award is actually the second most important thing about today because it's this man's birthday\", referring to Martin.. \"We'd like to use the rest of our time up here to sing for James,\" he added, before leading the audience in song while Martin clasped the Oscars award..
