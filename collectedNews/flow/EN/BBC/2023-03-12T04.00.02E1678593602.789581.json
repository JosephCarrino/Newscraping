        "content": "It's why he and his family are moving out of the flat they've lived in for the last 15 years. The whole building has been condemned after failing an earthquake safety test. There's a very high chance that a tremor would bring this whole block crashing to the ground. . Here in Istanbul, fear is growing. . The two powerful earthquakes in Turkey's south that claimed almost 50,000 lives have brought a new urgency to its biggest city. Home to 15 million people, it sits on the North Anatolian fault line, and experts predict it's due its own major earthquake before 2030. . Around 70% of the city's buildings were built before rule changes that enforced stricter construction standards in 1999, and so are considered potentially unsafe. Just three months ago, a study said a quake here could kill up to 90,000 people. Now, the race is on to get the city ready.. Mesut knows all too well the devastation a quake can cause. He's just returned from the epicentre in the southern city of Kahramanmaras, where he lost relatives. As we talked in his now-empty flat, he described the moment he found out. . \"It happened at 04:17, a relative called and we all woke up screaming.\" Mesut's face crumples into tears and he turns away to compose himself. \"It's a horrible situation. We couldn't get [to Kahramanmaras] for three days because of snow, and when we reached the rubble it was so hard. I can't describe it. I hope God doesn't make anyone else experience this.\". When Mesut returned to Istanbul, the authorities had shut off power and water to his flat. \"I asked for them back again just so we could move. They gave me two more days.\". \"The municipality had sent us written warning about it, but the situation wasn't resolved due to rejections from the neighbours. We knew that our utilities were going to be shut off, and we were ready to leave here, but then the quake happened and it all became a shambles.\". Since the earthquakes in the south, there've been more than 100,000 new applications to the Istanbul municipality for building safety checks. The waiting list for one shot up to three months, then four, and it keeps rising. . Tenants as well as landlords can now apply, but some still don't because of the financial implications. The compensation to help those who need to move out of condemned buildings is low. There are no official numbers showing how many fail the test. . The city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has promised more training for rescue teams, and preparation of temporary shelters that could house up to 4.5 million people in the aftermath of a quake. But many fear it still isn't enough.. A walk down an average Istanbul street tells you why. Many of the buildings have particular design features that can make them collapse if they're put under pressure during a quake. . Dr Kurtulus Atasever, a structural and earthquake engineer, met me to point some of them out. We stood on an empty patch of ground, strewn with rocks, that used to be the foundations of a building. When a magnitude 5.8 quake hit Istanbul in 2019, it was so badly damaged it had to be knocked down. Up and down the street, its neighbours have many of the same flaws.. Good quality concrete is vital, he tells me. And the architecture is crucial. \"We have some overhangs here. In this type of building we have some weak or soft storeys. There are short columns too, they are actually all typical building problems.\" . In very simple terms, each of them weakens a building at ground level, meaning it struggles to hold up the floors above if there's an earthquake. An overhang makes the rest of the building wider than the footprint. Soft storeys are where the ground floor is taller than the floors above it. Short columns don't have enough length compared to their diameter. . They can be done safely, Dr Atasever points out, but only if proper thought and planning has gone into the design. In old buildings especially, that's rare. . We're standing in the shadow of Yasemin Suleymanoglu's house, and I ask if she's concerned about the apartment block it's in. She holds her daughter's hand and looks up at the face of the building. \"I don't feel safe here,\" she says. . \"Our building shook a lot during the 2019 earthquake, and the columns of the one across the street cracked. I've been feeling restless since that sound, and with this latest quake we are really scared. We're losing our sleep because it may hit us any time. And I think we're at risk because our building is old.\" . The next step is the development of a 50km (31-mile) long fibre-optic based early warning system. But for a city so huge, it's hard to know where people would go to seek shelter, even if they had notice that a quake was coming.. As pictures of the devastation in the south continue to fill Turkish TV screens, these concerns are now front-of-mind for a huge slice of Istanbul's population. And just two months away from important presidential and parliamentary elections, that really matters. . Overnight, the earthquake and its aftermath have joined Turkey's economic crisis as a key issue for voters. Many aren't happy with the government's handling of either. The aftershocks here aren't just physical, they're political too. . ",

        "content": "But it faces competition from All Quiet on the Western Front and The Banshees of Inisherin, among others.. Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser, Cate Blanchett and Michelle Yeoh are the frontrunners in the acting categories.. The 2023 awards season has been one of the most unpredictable of recent years, with three of the four acting categories too close to call.. Winners have varied at the other major ceremonies, such as the SAG Awards, Baftas and Golden Globes, and there is a lack of consensus over who will triumph at the Oscars as a result.. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.. It will be the chat show host's third time hosting the Academy Awards. He most recently presided over the 2018 event.. The US comic is probably trying to forget about the other occasion, in 2017, when .  after the wrong best picture winner was mistakenly announced.. As part of a media call at the Dolby Theatre on Wednesday, Kimmel joked about how the venue's red carpet has changed colour for the first time since 1960.. Referring to .  Kimmel said: \"People have been asking if there's going to be any trouble this year, is there going to be any violence this year? . \"I certainly hope not. But if there is, I think the decision to go with a champagne carpet rather than a red carpet shows how confident we are that no blood will be shed.\". The decision to change the carpet's colour was actually made for practical reasons, .  The new one means organisers \"can transition more seamlessly from daytime arrivals to an elegant evening setting\".. Viewers in the US can watch the Oscars live on ABC. The network is also streaming the ceremony on its website and app.. In the UK, Sky will air the ceremony across four of its channels simultaneously - Sky Arts, Sky News, Sky Showcase and Sky Cinema Oscars.. Unusually, that means British viewers can watch the Oscars on Freeview and Freesat. It will also be available on streaming service Now (formerly Now TV). . The ceremony starts at 17:00 PT / 20:00 ET on Sunday. In the UK, it starts at midnight as Sunday becomes Monday.. The prizes are scheduled to be handed out over three hours - but the ceremony runs late almost every year, often by at least 30 minutes.. Traditionally, the four acting winners from the previous year's Oscars come back to present the prizes to their successors.. This year, three of 2022's winners are returning - Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur - but the fourth, Will Smith, is absent as .  for 10 years.. Other stars presenting categories this year include Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Samuel L Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, John Travolta, Emily Blunt, Glenn Close, Jennifer Connelly and Florence Pugh.. Interestingly, Halle Berry has also been invited to present. She remains the only woman of colour to win best leading actress at the Oscars, but we could see the second this year with Yeoh.. Other category presenters include Paul Dano, Andrew Garfield, Cara Delevingne, Kate Hudson, Michael B Jordan, Jonathan Majors, Mindy Kaling, Eva Longoria, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Andie MacDowell and Riz Ahmed.. They will be joined by Antonio Banderas, Elizabeth Banks, Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek Pinault, Melissa McCarthy, Halle Bailey, Janelle Monáe, Questlove, Elizabeth Olsen and Pedro Pascal.. Excitingly, this year's winners are the hardest to predict for some time, due to the variation at the many precursor ceremonies. . The only acting category awards pundits are confident about is Everything Everywhere All At Once star .  winning best supporting actor. . Otherwise, it's all to play for. .  (The Whale) and .  (Elvis) have both won a host of best actor prizes at other major events and either one could take the Oscar. . There is another dead heat in the actress category, with .  (Everything Everywhere All At Once) enjoying a late surge of momentum, challenging the early frontrunner .  (Tár).. Best supporting actress is arguably the most open of the acting categories - with a three-way race between .  (Wakanda Forever), .  (The Banshees of Inisherin) and . (Everything Everywhere All At Once).. At this point, .  is the clear frontrunner, having won nearly every major precursor it needed to - with the notable exception of Bafta.. The British Academy was far less keen on the film than US voters have been, and the Baftas gave far more prizes to . At the Oscars, the World War One epic is the bookies' second favourite to take the top prize, followed by . .. This video can not be played. Oscars 2023: The best picture contenders in 40 seconds. Best picture is decided via a preferential ballot - Academy members are asked to rank the 10 nominated films from favourite to least favourite.. That can mean a film which has passionate support among a vocal but relatively small section of the Academy can lose out to a film which pleased a wider number of voters overall. . For example, a crowd pleaser such as .  could be a dark horse in the best picture race due to the large number of second and third place votes it is likely to have received.. Rihanna will take to the Academy Awards stage exactly one month since .  She will perform Lift Me Up (from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), which is nominated for best original song. . The most likely winner in that category, however, is Naatu Naatu (from RRR) - which will be performed at the ceremony by Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava.. David Byrne, Son Lux and Stephanie Hsu will perform This Is A Life (from Everything Everywhere All at Once), while Diane Warren and Sofia Carson will perform Applause (from Tell It Like a Woman).. However, .  despite her song Hold My Hand (from Top Gun: Maverick) being the fifth nominee in the category. She is attending the ceremony though, so fans hope she might yet spring a surprise performance.. Elsewhere, Lenny Kravitz will perform during the In Memoriam segment, which pays tribute to film figures who have died over the past year. . Officially, these are the Academy Awards, but they have been known affectionately as the Oscars for decades.. There are three possible sources. One is the late US columnist Sidney Skolsky, who claimed he gave the award its nickname.. Actress Bette Davis claimed that the name derived from her observation that the backside of the statuette looked like that of her husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson.. But the most popular theory is one attributed to former Academy librarian Margaret Herrick, who declared that the golden statuette looked like her uncle Oscar.. ",
