        "content": "WATCH: UN Chief condemns Ukraine war in special meeting. The meeting was debating a motion backed by Ukraine and its allies demanding Russia pull out immediately and unconditionally.. Ukraine hopes that by supporting the motion countries will show solidarity.. The Kremlin has accused the West of wanting to defeat Russia at any cost. . Vasily Nebenzya, the Kremlin's ambassador to the UN, said the US and its allies were prepared to plunge the entire world into war.. Russian President Vladimir .  in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two. . The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to . , while Russia and Ukraine have each seen at least 100,000 of their soldiers killed or injured, . .   . More than 13 million people were made refugees abroad or displaced inside Ukraine.. Mr Putin's claim that his operation was needed to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine, a country with historic ties to Russia, was dismissed by Ukraine and its allies as a ruse for an unprovoked attack.. \"That invasion is an affront to our collective conscience,\" Mr Guterres told the General Assembly. \"It is a violation of the United Nations Charter and international law.\" . The possible consequences of a \"spiralling conflict\" were, he said, a \"clear and present danger\".. Mr Guterres said the war was \"fanning regional instability and fuelling global tensions and divisions, while diverting attention and resources from other crises and pressing global issues\".. There had, he said, been \"implicit threats to use nuclear weapons\".. \"It is high time to step back from the brink,\" he said.. \"Complacency will only deepen the crisis, while further eroding our shared principles proclaimed in the Charter. War is not the solution. War is the problem. People in Ukraine are suffering enormously. Ukrainians, Russians and people far beyond need peace.\". Sixty countries have sponsored the resolution, which stresses \"the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\". The UN is likely to approve the resolution, which is not legally binding but carries political weight. Voting will take place later on Thursday, the eve of the invasion's first anniversary.. Over the past year, the General Assembly has voted on similar resolutions opposing Russia's invasion. In October 143 member states voted to condemn Moscow's illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine. Russia, Belarus, Syria, and North Korea opposed the motion, while India and China were among the 35 states that abstained.. This video can not be played. Watch: Battle for the city of Bakhmut intensifies. Mr Guterres was speaking after Russia's President Vladimir .  for the war. . In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Putin also announced Russia's decision to suspend a key nuclear arms treaty after US President Joe Biden, fresh from a surprise visit to Kyiv, praised Western democracy for standing up to Russian aggression.. Mr Biden has called the decision to suspend the treaty, designed by the US and Russia in 2010 to prevent nuclear war, a . .. On Wednesday, Mr Putin met China's top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, in Moscow and said co-operation with Beijing was \"very important to stabilise the international situation\".

        "content": "The Israeli military said it killed three wanted militants holed up inside a house who refused to surrender.. Several of those killed outside were civilians, including two elderly men.. The Palestinian health ministry said 72-year-old Adnan Saabe Baara was one of them. Video footage purportedly showed his body in a street next to bags of bread, in what is usually a busy market area. . A 61-year-old man, Abdul Hadi Ashqar, and a 16-year-old boy, Mohammad Shaaban, were also shot dead, the ministry said. . Another elderly man, Anan Shawkat Annab, 66, who suffered from tear-gas inhalation, died in hospital on Wednesday evening.. Six members of the Lions' Den and other militant groups were killed during the raid, the Lions' Den said in a Telegram post.. The number of dead is one more than that of an Israeli military raid last month in Jenin, which was the deadliest in the West Bank since 2005. . What makes this raid even more significant is the huge numbers wounded, with the Palestinian health ministry saying more than 80 people have suffered bullet wounds. Five different hospitals in Nablus are currently treating them. . Senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh condemned what he described as a \"massacre\", while a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held Israel's government responsible for \"this dangerous escalation, which is pushing the region toward tension and an explosion\".. The militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, warned that it was \"monitoring the escalating crimes conducted by the enemy against our people in the occupied West Bank and is running out of patience\".. The raid lasted four hours and took place in the middle of morning, when the narrow streets of the old city are often packed with families and people shopping. . Resident Khalil Shaheen described hearing an explosion, which woke him up. . \"I looked out the window and saw special forces with dogs, and they were connecting wires, which I assume are for TNT [explosives], God knows,\" he said. . The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it \"upgraded\" its operation after forces were shot at by Palestinian gunmen. Its troops fired shoulder-launched missiles at the building where the wanted militants were hiding, which caused it to partially collapse.. It said it acted when it did because it had real-time information - thought to be a geolocated Facebook post - on the location of one of the militants.. \"We saw the threat and we had to go in and finish the work,\" IDF spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht said in a briefing to reporters. . But Palestinian videos posted on social media also show young men in the street, who appear unarmed, apparently being fired at while running away, with one falling to the ground as gunshots are heard. The IDF described the footage as \"problematic\" and said it was being reviewed.. Two of the militants in the encircled building were Muhammad Junaidi, a commander in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and another senior militant figure, Hussam Isleem.. The IDF said they and the third militant, Walid Dkhail, were suspected of carrying out previous shooting attacks, including one in the West Bank last October that killed an Israeli soldier, and of planning more attacks in the near future. Two other suspects were arrested in Nablus last week.. During the raid, Isleem recorded a WhatsApp audio message that was shared on social media, saying: \"We're in trouble, but we won't surrender ourselves. We won't hand over our weapons. I'll die as a martyr. Keep carrying weapons after us.\". Isleem's house had been raided by Israeli forces earlier this month and his family interrogated. His father told Palestinian media afterwards that forces told him his son should hand himself in or he would be killed. . Both Isleem and Junaidi were active in the Lions' Den - a new militant group that emerged in Nablus over the last year amid a collapse in control by the official Palestinian Authority security forces. . As with a similar group in the nearby city of Jenin, the young gunmen used TikTok and Telegram to spread a message of armed resistance against the Israeli occupation to a new generation of Palestinians. . Israel has targeted parts of both cities in waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids, saying it is trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis. . So far this year, more than 60 Palestinians - including militants and civilians - have been killed, while 11 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis.. Wednesday's deadly raid in Nablus is a further sign that recent attempts led by the US to ease tensions are failing. . This week, the Palestinian Authority abandoned its push for a vote at the UN Security Council on a resolution which would have censured Israel's new nationalist government over its plans to expand Israeli settlements in the West Bank. . As part of an apparent understanding, Israel then said it would not announce new settlements in the coming months. According to sources quoted in the Israeli media, Israel was also to lower the intensity of its raids into Palestinian cities.. ",

        "content": "The two Spectrum News 13 journalists were covering the killing of a woman in the area that morning when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . None of the three people killed in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",

        "content": "Beijing has maintained that the balloon was a weather ship blown off course.. But Washington says the balloon was part of a sprawling Chinese intelligence collection programme.. As the balloon flew over US territory, at least two planes gathered information on its features and trajectory.. A senior State Department official said earlier this month that fly-bys revealed it \"was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations\".. Officials first became aware of the balloon when it crossed into Alaskan airspace on 28 January.. Fighter jets belonging to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) - a joint operation between the US and Canada - identified the foreign object, but the military did not shoot it down at the time.. Officials explained they could not shoot the balloon down over land because its size and likely debris field posed a threat to civilians on the ground. . One defence official told US lawmakers earlier this month the balloon was as tall as the Statue of Liberty and had \"a jetliner-size payload\".. The image released on Wednesday was taken the day before the aircraft was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February. It has reportedly \"gained legendary status\" inside the Pentagon.. The balloon was said to be hovering at 60,000 feet (18,200m) in the air.. U-2 planes routinely fly at altitudes over 70,000 feet, according to the Air Force.. The single-seater reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, were previously flown by the CIA. Pilots are required to wear full pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts.. Recovery efforts for the balloon's scattered remnants in the Atlantic Ocean ended last Friday.. Pieces of the debris, including its payload, have been recovered and are being studied, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. ",

That was Meteorologist Evelyn Taft of station KCAL. She's been covering California weather for nearly 14 years. She stresses this is a bizarre weather event for Southern California, known locally as SoCal. It's \"unbelievable\", she says.. As much as 5ft (1.5m) of snow could fall in the mountains with wind gusts up to 75mph (121km/h). The lower foothills, like Santa Clarita, will see a rare dusting of snow.. \"Never thought that my move to LA would involve storm coverage… with snow,\" tweeted KCAL anchor Sheba Turk. She shared a video of herself in nearby Lebec, California, as big flakes of snow landed on her jacket. \"Look at this,\" she says. \"You see the flurries?\". \"I had to stop and get gloves. I didn't even bring gloves to LA with me.\" . Meteorologist Paul Deanno warned his Twitter followers they might start to see snow starting late Wednesday night. That's \"not a typo\", he said.. \"First blizzard warning of my career,\" tweeted Autumn Robinson of Spectrum News 1.. \"...In So Cal,\" she continued. \"Cool I guess.\" . Snow may be rare in Southern California, but the area is no stranger to extreme weather. Wildfires regularly spread through the area, and a years-long drought was just interrupted in January by heavy rains and flooding. . Meteorologists in SoCal and elsewhere say such extreme weather events are likely to grow more severe as the climate changes.. ",

        "content": "It comes after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and Canadian airspace before it was shot down by the US military. . China has also been recently accused of interfering with Canadian elections. . Monitoring buoys were discovered and retrieved last fall as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the country's security by surveilling air, land and sea domains.. A spokesperson for Canada's Department of National Defence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, said in a statement that the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches\". . Mr Le Bouthillier added that China does this using \"dual-purpose technologies\", meaning devices that conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes. . He said the military has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory since 2022, but did not elaborate on their nature.. China has long displayed interest in the Arctic. It has sent high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and participates in most major Arctic institutions. . It has also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north, often for research expeditions.. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate change, and gain access to emerging resources.. But experts say that China's research interests in the region have also doubled as attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.. Their efforts are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US, Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped potential in the region.. \"This is a part of the world that has not been mapped and understood to the same degree of detail as other latitudes,\" said Roberto Mazzolin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a former high-ranking official in the Canadian Armed Forces. . Mr Mazzolin said Canada has historically looked at the Arctic as a safe area with little potential for threat. But interest in the region by Russia, and more recently China, has changed that.. \"[Canada is forced to] look at how we would posture our own security, our military defence, or our economic development activities to secure Canadian and American interests,\" he said. . On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that she views China as an increasingly disruptive power. . Ms Joly added that Canada is working closely with the US to protect North American airspace, as well as Canada's Arctic sovereignty.. The Canadian military's discovery of the Chinese buoys comes at the heels of revelations by Canadian intelligence that China had tried to interfere in Canada's last federal election in 2021. . In documents first reported on by the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service outlined China's efforts to re-elect Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority of government, and to ensure the defeat of Conservative politicians who are seen as unfriendly to China.. It did so through cash donations to preferred candidates, the spread of disinformation and using consulates and paid students to help certain Liberal candidates, according to reporting by the Globe. . Canadian parliamentarians are in the midst of probing allegations that China interfered in Canada's 2019 federal election. On Tuesday, they expanded their scope to include the 2021 election as well. . On Wednesday, Prime Minister Trudeau called the suspected Chinese election interference \"an extraordinarily serious issue\", and said he supported a further probe into these reports. . He added the meddling efforts so far appear to have been unsuccessful, but still raise concern that foreign countries are trying to interfere with Canada's democratic processes. . \"Foreign actors are trying to undermine people's confidence in democracy itself,\" Mr Trudeau said.. Chinese officials in Canada have denied these reports, saying they do not interfere in Canadian election or internal affairs. Earlier this month, China's suspected surveillance efforts in North America dominated headlines after a Chinese balloon was discovered flying over North America.. Both the US and Canada said that the balloon was spying on sensitive military assets. China, however, has denied it was used for surveillance, instead saying it was a civilian weather balloon that had blown off course.. ",
