        "content": "Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia.. Russian energy giant Gazprom operates a facility near the village of Gubastovo, about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, where the drone crashed.. Gazprom told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that its operations in the Kolomna region had not been interrupted.. The target of the drone in Kolomna \"was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, which was not damaged\", Mr Vorobyov posted on Telegram. . \"There are no casualties or damage on the ground. The FSB (Russian security service) and other competent authorities are investigating,\" he added.. Images shared by Russian media and officials show a damaged drone in a snow-covered field in front of a forest of birch trees. The area around the Gazprom facility is heavily forested.. The appearance of the drone matches that of the UJ-22 Airborne, a product of Ukrainian manufacturer Ukrjet.. Ukrjet says the vehicle has a range of 800km - enough for it to reach the Kolomna area from Ukraine.. A reverse image reveals no previous matches for the image, suggesting it is recent.. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, tweeted a photo of the drone. . \"It is more than 500km away from Russian border with Ukraine. Soon Putin might get very afraid to show himself in public as drones can reach far distances,\" he wrote alongside the photo.. If Ukraine was behind the Kolomna drone, it would be the closest attempted drone attack to the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.. It came as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had downed two Ukrainian drones in southern Russia.. The ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to use drones \"to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar region and the Adygea Republic\", adding that they were \"neutralised by electronic warfare units\".. Moscow has accused Ukraine of being behind attacks on Russian military infrastructure during the war, but Kyiv has not confirmed this. .  left three people dead, Moscow said. The Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.. Just weeks before, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the same airfield, which is home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine.. In August, a series of blasts rocked a military base in Crimea, in what was seen as a significant expansion of the conflict by Ukraine into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . President Vladimir Putin told the FSB on Tuesday to intensify its activity against what he said was increasing espionage and sabotage by Ukraine and the West.. He instructed the FSB to strengthen security in territories occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He said units deployed at the border must stop sabotage groups and prevent the passage of illegal weapons and ammunition.   . \"We need to beef up our counterintelligence in general, because Western special services have traditionally been very active in relation to Russia,\" he said.. \"And now they have put in additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly.\". Russia's defence ministry said its fighter jets were involved in a training exercise in the country's western airspace on Tuesday, hours after airspace over St Petersburg was closed due to reports of an unidentified object..

Officials have warned the final death toll could climb to more than 100.. Rescuers pulled another body from the sea, that of a man, on Tuesday morning.. The three men arrested are said to have sailed the boat from Izmir in Turkey to Calabria in Italy despite bad weather conditions.. Police say they allegedly asked the migrants for about €8,000 (£7,000; $8,500) each to make the long journey.. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for.. The coffins of the victims found so far have been laid out in a sports hall in Crotone - small white caskets for the younger victims and brown ones for the adults - to allow people to pay their respects. At least 12 children including a baby are among the victims.. Relatives of the victims living in northern Europe have arrived to try to get news of their relatives and identify bodies where necessary. . Rescuers said many of the migrants on board came from Afghanistan, and Pakistan has said 16 of its citizens survived the disaster, but four were missing.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. ",

        "content": "The order follows similar moves by the EU and Canada in recent weeks. . A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry accused the US of abusing state power to suppress foreign firms.. \"We firmly oppose those wrong actions,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday. \"The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, stop suppressing the companies and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the US.\". \"How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that,\" she added. . Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the popular video sharing app - which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance - in recent months. . TikTok has faced allegations that it harvests users' data and hands it to the Chinese government, with some intelligence agencies worried that sensitive information could be exposed when the app is downloaded to government devices.. The company insists it operates no differently to other social media companies and says it would never comply with an order to transfer data. . On Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young told agencies they had to scrub the app from all state-issued phones to protect confidential data. . The agency said the guidance marked a \"critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data\". . Some federal offices - including the White House and the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State - have already banned TikTok from their devices. . The US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said the move emphasised the Biden administration's \"ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people's security and privacy\". . Tuesday's announcement follows the passage of legislation by the US House of Representatives in December which banned the use of TikTok on state-issued phones and gave the White House 60 days to issue agency directives. . And congressional Republicans are expected to pass further legislation in the coming weeks which would give President Joe Biden the power to ban the app nationally. . \"We hope that when it comes to addressing national security concerns about TikTok beyond government devices, Congress will explore solutions that won't have the effect of censoring the voices of millions of Americans,\" a TikTok spokesperson told the BBC. .  starting from Tuesday. The decision followed a review conducted by the country's chief information officer, who ruled the app presented \"an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\".. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.. \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.. And the European Parliament also approved a ban on the app on staff phones, following the European Commission's move last week. . A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that the bans had been adopted \"without any deliberation\" and amounted to \"little more than political theatre\". . ",

        "content": "\"It became evident that some people wanted all schools, especially girls' schools, to be closed down,\" the deputy health minister said on Sunday.. However, he later said that his remarks had been misunderstood.. The prosecutor general announced last week that he was opening a criminal investigation. However, he said that the available information only indicated \"the possibility of criminal and premeditated acts\".. Meanwhile, public frustration is continuing to grow.. The first poisoning took place on 30 November, when 18 students from the Nour Technical School in the religious city of Qom were taken to hospital.. Since then, more than 10 girls' schools have been targeted in the surrounding province.. At least 194 girls are reported to have been poisoned in the past week at four schools in the city of Borujerd, in the western province of Lorestan.. And on Tuesday another 37 students were poisoned at the Khayyam Girls' School in Pardis, near the capital Tehran.. The poisoned girls have reported the smell of tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill. . Earlier this month, at least 100 people protested outside the governor's office in Qom.. \"You are obliged to ensure my children's safety! I have two daughters,\" one father shouted in a video widely shared on social media. \"Two daughters... and all I can do is not let them go to school.\". \"This is a war!\" declared a woman. \"They are doing this in a girls' high school in Qom to force us to sit at home. They want girls to stay at home.\" . Some parents have said their children were ill for weeks after the poisoning.. Another video from a hospital shows a teenage girl lying dazed on a bed, with her mother beside her.. \"Dear mothers, I'm a mother and my child is in a hospital bed and her limbs are weak,\" says the distraught mother. \"I pinch her but she doesn't feel anything. Please don't send your children to school.\". At a news conference on Sunday, Deputy Health Minister Younes Panahi said the girls had been poisoned by chemicals that \"are not military grade and are publicly available\".. \"The pupils do not need any invasive treatment and it's necessary to maintain calm,\" he added.. Dr Panahi's comment that it was \"evident that some people wanted all schools... to be closed down\" appeared to confirm the government believed the poisonings were premeditated. . His subsequent denial suggested splits among officials over how to handle public anger when no suspects have been identified.. The poisonings have notably been concentrated in Qom, a city that is home to important Shia Muslim shrines and the religious leadership that forms the backbone of the Islamic Republic.. Since September, the clerical establishment has been challenged by the mass protests that erupted after the death in custody of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf \"properly\".. Some Iranians have speculated that if the schoolgirls are being poisoned as \"payback\" for their role in the unrest. Social media was flooded with videos showing schoolgirls ripping off their headscarves and chanting anti-establishment slogans.. Others have speculated that the poisonings are the work of hardliners who want to \"copy\" the Taliban in Afghanistan and the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria by terrorising parents to stop sending their girls to school. . \"Has Boko Haram come to Iran?\" former Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi asked in an Instagram post. . The reformist politician also warned that \"extremists will interpret the boundaries of government and religion in their favour\".. Iran's leaders have traditionally rejected criticism of its restrictions on women, such as the mandatory headscarf, and instead boasted about the number of women who attend university. But if young girls do not finish school, college is just a dream.. The comments of one schoolgirl, who says she has been poisoned twice, at the meeting with Qom's governor earlier this month highlighted how vague and misleading some of the statements from the authorities have been.. \"They [officials] tell us: 'All is good, we've done our investigation.' But when my father asked at my school, they told him: 'Sorry, the CCTV has been down for a week and we can't investigate this,'\" she said.. \"And when I was poisoned for the second time on Sunday, the school principal said: 'She has a heart condition, that's why she is hospitalised.' But I don't have any heart condition!\" . ",

Mummification was practiced by a variety of cultures in Peru before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.
