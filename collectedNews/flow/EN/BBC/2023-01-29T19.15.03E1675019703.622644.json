        "content": "Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols. Scorpion stands for \"Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\".. The unit is a 50-person team tasked with bringing down crime levels in particular areas.. But now it is being abolished after its officers were seen beating Mr Nichols, 29, in the videos from 7 January.. In a statement, the department said \"it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate\" the unit. . \"While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonour on the title Scorpion, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department, take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted,\" it added.. Mr Nichols' family welcomed the decision in a statement from their lawyers, calling it \"both appropriate and proportional to the tragic death of Tyre Nichols, and also a decent and just decision for all citizens of Memphis\".. The unit was launched in October 2021 with a focus on high-impact crimes, such as car thefts and gang-related offences.. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired last week.. They were taken into custody on Thursday and each faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.. Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who \"appeared on the scene following\" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation. . \"The unit that murdered Tyre has been permanently disbanded,\" a protester shouted into a megaphone in Memphis and the crowd erupted into cheers. . Despite the rain, the group of fewer than 100 protesters had gathered in the square in front of the Memphis Police headquarters to demand change to a system of policing that they said makes a habit of brutalising black people in Memphis and across the country.   . \"Memphis is taking a stand,\" said Casio Montez, one of the protest organisers. \"This means we're doing something right.\". Mr Montez vowed that he and other community organisers would continue to pressure Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis and city officials until \"the community's demands are met\", including reforming the department's organised crime unit.  . In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Chief Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be \"more responsive\" and \"more proactive\" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols \"decided to go off the rails\".   . \"We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,\" she said. \"This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.\"  . But for some, the problem of police violence is more deeply rooted than any reform can address. . At the rally Saturday, Memphis native Allie Watkins held a sign that proclaimed, \"All cops uphold white supremacy.\"  . The sign is historically accurate, she said, because the history of policing in America began with slave patrols.  . \"This is not an issue of corruption in the United States, this is an issue of the fact that the system has been built against black bodies,\" she said.  If the system is broken, she added, the only way to fix it is to start again.. \"We need to have national criminal justice reform\", Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the BBC. She said units like the Scorpion unit exist \"across the country\" so piecemeal reform was not going to be a solution. . Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January.. Mr Nichols was black, as are all five officers charged in the case.. Memphis Police Department released four graphic videos of the traffic stop and its violent aftermath on Friday, totalling more than an hour of footage.. Peaceful protests took place in Memphis on Friday night after the video was released, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in the city, while small-scale demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country.. Many protesters held banners demanding justice for Mr Nichols and an end to \"police terror\".. Lawyers for Mr Nichols' family likened the assault to the 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King.. The Scorpion programme was touted by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland in a speech a year ago. He said the city used crime data \"to determine where the unit will conduct its enforcement activities within the city\".. From October 2021 until January 2022, the unit made 566 arrests, he said. They also seized more than $100,000 in cash, 270 vehicles and 253 weapons.. In the wake of Mr Nichols' death, one local man, Cornell McKinney, told a Memphis-area TV network that he had a tense encounter with the unit on 3 January, just days before the incident involving Mr Nichols.. Mr McKinney alleges that the officers - who were travelling in unmarked vehicles - threatened to \"blow his head off\", pointed a weapon at his head and accused him of carrying drugs.. He complained to the Memphis Police Department after the incident, but says he has not heard anything back.. One of the officers that arrested Mr Nichols had previously been sued by a man who accused him of beating him when he was a prisoner eight years ago.. ",

        "content": "People now have until 10 February to do the swap.. The redesign of the higher denomination naira notes has been heavily criticised with analysts saying six weeks was not enough time for Africa's most-populous country to phase out the old currency.  . It is happening a few weeks before the country goes to the polls in presidential and parliamentary elections.. Local media has been reporting that there are not enough of the new notes in circulation, with people unable to withdraw them from banks. . The move by the the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is seen as a push to encourage Nigerians to embrace digital payments in a society where cash is king.. It hopes the exchange will bring some of the cash currently being hoarded by individuals and companies back into the banking system.. When the bank announced in October that the 1,000 ($2.18, £1.75), 500 and 200 naira notes were to be replaced, it said 80% of the notes in circulation were outside banks.. The CBN believes that with the redesigned currency it will have a better understanding of the money circulating in the economy so it can better manage inflation. . The bank governor said the new deadline of 10 February would allow more people in rural areas, where there are very few bank branches, to exchange the old notes.. He added that Nigerians would then have a further seven days to deposit old notes directly with the CBN.. ",

        "content": "But Ukraine has asked allied nations to create a \"fighter jet coalition\" to bolster their capabilities. . The US said it would discuss the idea of supplying jets \"very carefully\" with Kyiv on Thursday. . In an interview with Tagesspiegel, Mr Scholz said his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks.. \"The fact we've only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and the next debate is firing up in Germany, that just seems frivolous\", he said. . On Wednesday Germany committed to supplying 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, after weeks of pressure from allies.. Following Germany's commitment to send the tanks, the US said it would provide Ukraine with its M1 Abrams tanks. . Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Andrii Melnyk, has called for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would provide Ukraine with US F-16s and F-35s, Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Ukraine's Freedom Television Network they also needed missiles \"to drastically reduce the Russian army's key weapon\".. And Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky echoed that in a daily video address where he said the country needed the US-made ATACMS missile, which has a range of 185 miles (297km). . He said the missiles would help Ukraine anticipate Russian attacks on urban areas and civilians. . Washington has so far refused to provide that weapon. . In the Tagesspiegel interview, Mr Scholz reiterated that Nato was not at war with Russia, \"we will not allow such an escalation,\" he said. . He confirmed that he speaks regularly to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, with the most recent call between the two in December 2022. . \"We need to talk to each other,\" he said, but added that he was always clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was absolutely unacceptable and only the withdrawal of its troops would resolve the situation. .
