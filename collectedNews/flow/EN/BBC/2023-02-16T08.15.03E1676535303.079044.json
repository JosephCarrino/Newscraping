        "content": " which until now had not lost its power to inspire, to lift the spirits. . The astonishing saga of the Thai boys rescued from the cave in July 2018 was that rarest of things in the news business: a tale with an almost flawlessly happy ending.. When we first got news that a group of Thai footballers had gone missing, I had dashed with my colleagues up to Chiang Rai, and then to the entrance of the Tham Luang cave complex, carrying just three days of clothes. . In my haste I had assumed few people around the world would care for long. The boys would be found, or perhaps they never would. That would be that. It was quite a misjudgement, and in the mud-soaked conditions outside the cave, I would come to regret my packing decisions. . Five days later, with no indication that the boys were alive or where they might be, and Thai rescuers driven out of the cave by rising flood waters, I was interviewed by a Thai television team.  . I found I was too emotional to respond. The boys were more or less the same age as my two sons. Dom was just 12 days older than my eldest. Reporting about them day and night, seeing their bikes still chained to the railings by the cave, they had become very precious lives. . Against all the evidence, all of us hoped against hope that they might still be alive.. And then that astonishing moment, when British divers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton found them, calling out in the dark, \"how many are you? Thirteen? Brilliant\". It seemed nothing less than a miracle. . The journalists at the cave site multiplied quickly, far more than it could accommodate. But we knew getting the boys out would be difficult. So difficult, in fact, that the divers had told the Thai government getting even half of them out alive should be considered a success. . By now they were the most famous boys in the world. All of Thailand was rooting for them. For days the Thai authorities had pushed for a zero-risk option - leaving the boys there until the monsoon rains stopped four months later, even though they were warned this was a near-certain death sentence. Their lives had become too precious.. And when they eventually went for the high-risk, improvised rescue plan, and we watched the boys and their coach being brought out, heavily sedated, one by one over three days, it seemed impossible they had all survived.. But they did. And within days they were charming the world in their first appearance before the media, smiling, joking, knocking footballs around. . The Thai government took control at that point, leading the lucrative negotiations with Hollywood filmmakers and organising overseas trips. Yet none of that ever spoiled them.. They remained small-town boys with a few big dreams - polite, grateful for the effort so many had made to save them, and for the new opportunities their story had brought them to travel and study, but always refreshingly down-to-earth. Even the fear that fame would inevitably tarnish the fairy tale proved unfounded.. When he won the scholarship to go to Britain last year, Dom thanked Zico, the former Thai national team captain who had arranged it, and promised to study hard there. . \"I will do my level best,\" he wrote. No-one who watched him and his team-mates dealing so modestly with all the attention that came their way can doubt that he would have lived up to that promise.. This video can not be played. How the Thai cave boys were rescued. ",

        "content": "Welch became an international sex symbol in the 1960s, widely remembered for playing a bikini-clad cavewoman in the 1966 film One Million Years B.C.. She also won a Golden Globe for her role in 1974's The Three Musketeers.. Born Jo-Raquel Tejada in 1940, Welch grew up in California, where she won teen beauty pageants and later became a local weather forecaster.. During a brief stint in Dallas, Texas, the divorced mother-of-two modelled for the Neiman Marcus clothing store and worked as a cocktail waitress.. Her big break came in 1964 soon after she moved back to California, when she scored cameos in A House Is Not A Home, and Roustabout, a musical starring Elvis Presley.. She shot to prominence two years later, with her back-to-back roles in the sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage and the fantasy movie One Million Years B.C.. Welch only had a few lines in the latter, but promotional stills of her wearing a skimpy two-piece deerskin bikini turned her into a leading pin-up girl of the era.. Despite her public image, however, she long expressed discomfort with the representation of her body, once saying she \"was not brought up to be a sex symbol, nor is it in my nature to be one\".. \"The fact that I became one is probably the loveliest, most glamorous and fortunate misunderstanding,\" she added.. This video can not be played. Watch: What a Hollywood studio asked Raquel Welch to change her name to. Welch went on to address her image in her memoir, Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage, in which she opened up about her childhood, her early career woes as a single mother in Hollywood, and why she would never lie about her age.. In a career spanning over five decades, Welch appeared in more than 30 movies and 50 television shows.. It included playing the love interest of Frank Sinatra's character in 1968's Lady in Cement; the titular transgender heroine in 1970's Myra Breckenridge; and a Golden Globe-nominated performance in the 1987 TV drama Right to Die.. Later in life, she also released her own signature line of wigs, a jewellery and skincare collection, and a Mac Cosmetics makeup line.. Actress Reese Witherspoon was among those paying tribute, writing on Twitter that she \"loved\" working with Welch on Legally Blonde.. \"She was elegant, professional and glamorous beyond belief,\" said Witherspoon. \"Simply stunning.\". Actress and producer Viola Davis posted a clip of her singing \"I'm a Woman\" with Cher in 1975, writing: \"You were ageless to me...iconic\".. In 1978 she sang the same song with the famous puppet Miss Piggy, earning a tribute on Wednesday from the beloved comedy programme.. 'We'll never forget our remarkable friend Raquel Welch, one of our favorite guests on The Muppet Show,\" the Disney series tweeted.. Actor Paul Feig said he enjoyed working with her on TV series Sabrina the Teenage Witch.. \"Kind, funny and a true superstar whom I was pretty much in love with for most of my childhood,\" he wrote, adding: \"We've lost a true icon.\". She leaves behind a son, Damon Welch, and daughter Latanne \"Tahnee\" Welch, who is also an actress.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Family of victim charges Buffalo shooter in court room. Payton Gendron, 19, pleaded guilty to 25 counts, including first-degree murder and terrorism motivated by hate.. Ahead of the sentencing on Wednesday, a family member rushed towards the killer and was restrained by security. . Other relatives shared emotional impact statements.. Barbara Massey, whose sister Katherine was killed, said to the gunman: \"You are going to come to our city and decide you don't like black people. Man, you don't know a damn thing about black people. We're human.\". Ms Massey's statement was interrupted by her own son lunging toward the gunman. She told reporters outside court \"he saw me emotional and I'm his mom\".. \"We're close,\" she said. \"You hurt one of us, you hurt us all.\". Zaire Goodman, who was injured, suffers from survivor's guilt, his mother told the courtroom. . \"He is dealing with the pain that I as a mother cannot bear,\" Zeneta Everhart said.. \"On that day this terrorist made the choice that the value of a black human meant nothing to himâ€¦ whatever the sentence is that [the gunman] receives, it will never be enough.\". Brian Talley lost family member Geraldine Talley in the shooting. . He said: \"I forgive you, but I forgive you not for your sake, but for mine and for this black community.\". All of the 10 people killed were black. Three others were wounded.. Wayne Jones, the son of a victim, Celestine Chaney, addressed the killer: \"You've been brainwashed. You don't even know black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.. \"I hope you find it in your heart to apologise to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason.\". The killer wept as Tamika Harper shared memories of her murdered aunt, Geraldine Talley.. Ms Harper told him: \"Do I hate you? No. Do I want you to die? No. I want you to stay alive. I want you to think about this every day of your life.\". Investigators said the gunman researched the racial makeup of Buffalo, which was 200 miles (320km) away from his house in Conklin, New York, before his attack.. Wearing bullet-resistant armour, he live-streamed the 14 May attack at Tops Friendly Market after writing online how he had been inspired by other racially motivated shootings. . But speaking to the court on Wednesday he warned against copycat shootings.. The gunman, who is not eligible for parole, said: \"I shot and killed people because they were black. Looking back now, I can't believe I actually did it. . \"I believed what I read online and acted out of hate. I know I can't take it back, but I wish I could, and I don't want anyone to be inspired by me and what I did.\". As she delivered her decision, Judge Susan Eagan said: \"There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances.\". New York state no longer allows the death penalty, but prosecutors at the federal level may seek it over hate and domestic terror charges to which the gunman has pleaded not guilty.. ",
