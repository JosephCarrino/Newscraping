        "content": "Meanwhile, unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places. . The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 30,000.. More arrests are expected - but the action will be seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. . Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.. With elections looming, .  after spending 20 years in power.. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone, he appeared to blame fate. \"Such things have always happened,\" he said. \"It's part of destiny's plan.\". On the sixth day after the quake hit, the situation is growing more desperate. . On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province. Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.. \"There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,\" Austrian Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said. \"The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.\". The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. . Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. . Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening.. The border crossing between Turkey and Armenia reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track down the object which Mr Trudeau says was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.. It is the third object to be shot down over North America in the last week.. The American military destroyed a Chinese balloon last weekend, and on Friday an unspecified object the size of a small car was shot down off Alaska.. Mr Trudeau confirmed on Saturday he gave the order and had spoken with US President Joe Biden.. \"Canadian forces will now recover and analyse the wreckage of the object,\" he wrote on Twitter.. The latest unspecified object was flying over central Yukon at about 40,000 ft (12,000m) and intercepted at about 15:41 local time on Saturday, defence minister Anita Anand told reporters.. She described it as \"small\" and \"cylindrical\", but that recovery efforts are still being carried out to discover more details.. Ms Anand said it was taken out \"about 100 miles\" from the US border, adding it posed a \"reasonable threat to civil aviation\".. She said it \"appears to be smaller than the one shot down off the coast of South Carolina\" .  - meaning the giant Chinese suspected spy balloon that measured 200ft (60m) tall.. Posting earlier on Twitter, Prime Minister Trudeau thanked the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) which carries out air defence for the US and Canada and led the mission.. The White House said the object had been tracked and monitored \"over the last 24 hours\".. \"Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,\" it said. . \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\". Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.. Pentagon Press Secretary Brig Gen Pat Ryder added that the FBI will be \"working closely\" with Canadian police.. Separately on Saturday, the US military also scrambled fighter jets over Montana as some airspace was closed - but it turned out to be a \"radar anomaly\" and nothing unusual was found.. The latest object's appearance over North America comes just a week after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was also destroyed by the US.. On Friday another unspecified object was tracked and shot down over Alaska at the orders of US President Biden. . In a short statement, the military said US troops, including from the Alaska National Guard, were still conducting search and recovery activities on sea ice for Friday's object.. It said it had no further details about the object's capabilities, purpose or origin but confirmed the FBI is helping with the recovery near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse.. \"Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,\" it added - and that the rescue operation will continue as weather permits.. Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. China has denied the balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. The US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\".. In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the Chinese balloon, maintaining that it was not \"a major breach\".. ",

        "content": "Watch: Rescuers use specialist cameras to free Irem And Merve from the rubble of their building in Antakya. With sensitive devices they listen for any response. Everyone is frozen in anticipation.. And then, a breakthrough. \"Irem, my dear, I am close to you, you hear me, yes?\" Mustafa says. . Those of us watching can't hear it, but it is clear now that she is responding. A small group of the girls' friends wait silently with us.. \"You are superb! Now you stay calm and answer me. Ah ok, that's Merve. Merve dear, just answer my questions,\" he says.. Merve, 24, and her sister Irem, 19, were trapped under the rubble of their five-storey apartment block in Antakya, southern Turkey, which was flattened by the earthquake. It had been two days, but for them those days felt like weeks.. \"It's Wednesday. No! You weren't trapped for 14 days. Give us five minutes. You will be out.\". Mustafa knows it will take hours, but tells us: \"If they lose their hope they might not survive.\". Merve and Irem start to joke and laugh together. I can see a big smile on Mustafa's face: \"If they had space they would probably dance,\" he says.. By the rescuers' calculations it is 2m (6.6 ft) to reach the sisters but Hasan Binay, the rescue team's commander, says digging a tunnel into the concrete is a very delicate operation. One wrong move could lead to a catastrophe.. A bulldozer is called to very slightly lift and hold the thick concrete to stop the building collapsing when they start digging.. \"Girls, soon we will give you blankets.\" Mustafa tells the sisters. \"Ah no, you don't worry about us. We are not tired or cold.\". Mustafa says Merve is worried about the rescuers' situation. It is 20:30 local time and it is very cold. This area has had one of the coldest winters that people can remember.. The rescuers start furiously digging and throwing the rubble away with their bare hands.. But after a couple of hours we feel the ground suddenly shaking under our feet. It is a strong aftershock. Operations must stop and we leave the devastated building.. \"There is a brutal reality here. The safety of our team comes first,\" Hasan says.. After 30 minutes, Mustafa and three other rescuers go back to where they were digging.. \"Don't be scared. Believe me we won't leave you here. I will bring you out and you will take us for a good lunch,\" Mustafa shouts. The girls thought they had been left to die.. It is midnight now and the digging has resumed. The team have hardly slept for days. We have gathered around a small fire next to the building.. Every so often there is a shout: \"sessizlik\", meaning silence. The light goes off, total darkness now. They have made a small hole in the concrete to see if the girls can see the light coming from Mustafa's torch.. \"Merve! Irem! Do you see the light? OK! Perfect! Now I am sending a small camera down. Once you see it tell me and I will tell you what to do.\". It is a moment of elation for everyone. Hasan joins his team to see the girls on the small screen connected to their night vision camera. They can see both Irem and Merve.. \"You are so beautiful. Don't move too much. Irem pull the camera so we can see Merve better.\" . On the screen, we see that Irem is smiling. Luckily there is enough space for them between the concrete trapping them.. Relief floods everyone's faces. The girls look well and at least Irem has room to pull herself out if they make the hole bigger.. But almost immediately the team look concerned. Merve has told them that she has started to feel cold and there is something heavy on her feet.. The medics were worried: \"Do Merve's feet have gangrene? Or is this the first symptom of hypothermia?\". It is around 05:00 now. The tunnel is big enough for the slimmest team member to crawl down. The rescuer was able to reach and hold Irem's hand for a few moments.. \"Our mother's body has started to stink and we can't breathe properly,\" Irem tells the rescuers. The girls have been lying next to their dead mother for days.. It is shocking. How awful that there can be moments in life when you would not want your mother next to you, we reflected.. Hasan asks one of Merve's friends - still waiting, stressed and silent - to show them the picture she has of the girls. They are trying to estimate the width they need to make the hole. The two girls are smiling, in party dresses, celebrating a wedding.. \"Perfect! We can bring them out.\" The medical team gets ready with thermal blankets and stretchers. Everyone is excited. It is 06:30 and Irem comes first. She is laughing and crying at the same time.. \"God bless you. Please bring Merve out too. Please,\" she begs the rescuers. \"Merve will follow. I promise,\" Hasan tells her.. But bringing Merve out takes another tense 30 minutes. They need to free her feet from under the concrete without doing her harm. The operation is successful.. Once Merve is out, everyone starts clapping and cheering. I hear Merve screaming in pain but then asking: \"Am I really alive?\". \"You are dear,\" Mustafa replies, smiling.. The friends who have been here all night start shouting in tears. \"Merve! Irem! We are here. Don't be scared.\" The sisters were loaded into ambulances and transferred to a field hospital.. After this joyful moment comes a chilling one. The rescuers ask everyone to be silent again. This is the last call.. \"If anyone hears me, respond. If you can't respond, try to touch the ground.\". Hasan repeats, imploringly, from different angles. Then sadly, with red spray he signs on the concrete, writing codes so other rescue teams will not search the building.. \"Rescuing a human being is a beautiful feeling, but we wish there were no deaths.\" I can see the sadness in his face.. \"Will you eat lunch with Merve and Irem?\" I ask. He smiles: \"I hope one day we can. But the most important thing is that they are alive and in good hands now.\". ",

Northland declared a state of emergency then too over fears of unprecedented rain, but those concerns proved to be unfounded.. This time, however, gale force winds and heavy rain has been reported, leaving thousands of people without power. They have been warned that it may take days for power to be restored. . \"This is a serious event for New Zealand,\" meteorologist Georgina Griffiths told Radio New Zealand. . People who knew their homes were flood-prone were advised to evacuate ahead of the storm's arrival. . Declaring a state of emergency gives local authorities greater power to respond to dangerous situations and allows them to restrict travel and provide aid.. Further south in the country's largest city, Auckland, authorities issued a red weather alert - meaning severe gales, flooding and land slips are possible. . Schools have once again been advised to move learning online and emergency shelters have been set up in preparation for the storm. Trains have been cancelled and the Harbour Bridge, an important transport link, has been temporarily closed.. Air New Zealand, the country's national carrier, has announced it would cancel multiple long-haul international fights, Tasman and Pacific Island flights, and domestic services in and out of Auckland planned for Monday, when the worst of the bad weather is expected. . Thousands of homes suffered damage in January's record-breaking rainfall, which caused severe flooding and landslides, and four people died.. Residents are on high alert as they have been warned that the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure from the recent deluge could mean parts of the city will flood again more easily.. They have been using sandbags to try and people protect their houses and long queues have been forming at supermarkets after the authorities advised people to have enough supplies to last at least three days in case the situation deteriorated. . \"The water was knee-deep,\" one man who was filling up sandbags and a public facility told Television New Zealand. \"You never know what`s going to happen in the next two days.\". \"We had the creak behind us burst its banks, and it was pretty much against our back fence,\" said another. . New Zealand's prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has asked people to take the severe weather warnings seriously and to make sure they are prepared. . \"Central and local government have been working very closely to prepare for this event and also to make sure the early lessons that can be captured from our response a week or two back can be incorporated into this one.\". Thousands of people are already reported to be without power on the Coromandel Peninsula - where major roads connecting the mainly rural communities have been closed or are under warnings. . Residents in vulnerable areas there and in Tairāwhiti have also been urged to seriously consider evacuating..

Storm Gabrielle hits New Zealand. The tiny Australian territory of Norfolk Island, which lies north of New Zealand, had a lucky escape after the storm's most destructive winds bypassed it. . Norfolk Island's emergency controller, George Plant, told ABC News there were some emergency calls but that an initial assessment suggests the damage was \"manageable\". . \"We're feeling very fortunate as a community that we didn't cop the full brunt of what Gabrielle had to offer,\" resident Hannah Taylor said. . \"If she had moved a few a little bit south, we would have seen a lot more damage.\".

        "content": "It is believed the women want to make sure their babies are born in Argentina to obtain Argentinian citizenship. . The number of arrivals has increased recently, which local media suggests is a result of the war in Ukraine. . Of the 33 women who arrived in the Argentinian capital on one flight on Thursday, three were detained because of \"problems with their documentation\", joining three more who arrived the previous day, migration agency head Florencia Carignano told La Nacion. . The Russian women had initially claimed they were visiting Argentina as tourists, she said. . \"In these cases it was detected that they did not come here to engage in tourism activities. They acknowledged it themselves.\". She said the Russian women wanted their children to have Argentinian citizenship because it gave more freedom than a Russian passport. . \"The problem is that they come to Argentina, sign up their children as Argentinean and leave. Our passport is very secure across the world. It allows [passport-holders] to enter 171 countries visa-free,\" Ms Carignano said.. Having an Argentine child also speeds up the citizenship process for parents. As it stands, Russians can travel visa-free to only 87 countries. . Travel to many Western countries has become more difficult for Russians since their country invaded Ukraine last February. . Last September, the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia was suspended, resulting in the need for additional documentation, increased processing times and more restrictive rules for the issuing of visas.. A number of countries have also suspended tourist visas for Russians, including .  that border Russia.. A lawyer for the three women who were detained on Thursday said that they are being \"falsely imprisoned\", as they are being held on suspicion of being \"false tourists\". This is a term \"which does not exist in our legislation,\" Christian Rubilar said. . \"These women who didn't commit a crime, who didn't break any migratory law, are being illegally deprived of their freedom,\" he added.. The women have since been released. . La Nacion attributed the dramatic uptick in arrivals of Russian citizens to the war in Ukraine, saying that \"besides fleeing war and their country's health service, [Russian women] are attracted by their [right of] visa-free entry to Argentina, as well as by the high-quality medicine and variety of hospitals\".. \"Birth tourism\" by Russian citizens to Argentina appears to be a lucrative and well-established practice. . A Russian-language website seen by the BBC offers various packages for expecting mothers who wish to give birth in Argentina. The website advertises services such as personalised birth plans, airport pick-ups, Spanish lessons and discounts on the cost of stays in \"the best hospitals in the Argentinian capital\". . The packages range from \"economy class\", starting at $5,000 (£4,144), to \"first class\", starting at $15,000 (£12,433).. The website says its founder has been facilitating birth tourism and offering migration support since 2015, and the company says it is \"100% Argentinian\".. On Saturday, La Nacion reported that Argentinian police has been carrying out raids as part of an investigation into a \"million-dollar business and illicit network\" that allegedly provided pregnant Russian women and their partners with fake documents issued in record time to allow them to settle in Argentina. . Police said the gang charged up to $35,000 (£29,011) for the service.. No arrests were made, but police were said to have seized laptops and tablets as well as immigration papers and significant quantities of cash.. ",
