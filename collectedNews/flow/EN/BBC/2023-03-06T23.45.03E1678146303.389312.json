        "content": "Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. A local official says . .. But Deputy Mayor Oleksandr Marchenko said at the weekend that Russia had not yet gained control of the city.. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner private army involved in the Russian campaign, .  amid apparent friction between his fighters and regular Russian forces. . He also says his representative had been barred from a Russian military headquarters.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin. . Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine it annexed last September after referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Mr Zelensky said in his evening address that he had discussed Bakhmut with senior generals..  \"[They] responded not to withdraw, but to strengthen [our defences],\" he said..  \"The command unanimously supported this position. There were no other positions. I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut.\". The comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that armed forces commander Valery Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.. Most defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.. And at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were .  while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.. Ground forces commander Olexandr Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".. \"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\".

        "content": "Polls suggest a tight race in a country highly polarised after two decades of Mr Erdogan's authoritarian rule.. Economic crisis and .  may make him more vulnerable than in previous elections.. A huge crowd of supporters cheered Mr Kilicdaroglu, a former civil servant, as he was chosen by a six-party opposition alliance.. Known as \"Gandhi Kemal\" or \"Turkey's Gandhi\" for his resemblance to Indian civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi, the quiet-spoken 74 year old offers a radically different vision in both substance and style to the fiery, charismatic Mr Erdogan's.. However, some of Mr Kilicdaroglu's allies fear he lacks drawing power.. He promised his supporters that he would govern Turkey through consensus and consultation.. \"Our table is the table of peace,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. \"Our only goal is to take the country to days of prosperity, peace and joy.\". He also said he would return the country to a parliamentary system - Mr Erdogan oversaw a transition to a presidential system in 2018, gaining sweeping powers.. The CHP was created by modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and is the country's oldest political party, though it has been out of power centrally since the 1990s.. However, Mr Kilicdaroglu has broadened its appeal by embracing minority groups and has formed alliances with right-wing parties.. He has also shown himself willing to challenge Mr Erdogan, a leader who has become increasingly intolerant of criticism.. In February's earthquake, in which more than 45,000 people were killed in south-eastern Turkey, Mr Kilicdaroglu led attacks on the government, which he said had allowed corruption and poor building standards..

        "content": "The couple later fled, but they were arrested nine months later at the Croatia-Montenegro border and returned to Spain.  . None of the wine has been recovered. . The court named the couple only as Tatania and Estanislao, but they have been identified by Spanish media as Priscila Guevara and Constantín Dumitru. . According to the court, Tatania checked into the exclusive Atrio hotel in October 2021 using a fake Swiss passport. . She was later joined by Estanislao and they both enjoyed a 14-course meal at the property's Michelin star restaurant, followed by a guided tour of the wine cellar. . Estanislao then returned in the early hours of the following morning to raid the cellar using a stolen key, which the court suggested he took from reception while Tatania provided a distraction. . One of the bottles of wine, which were stuffed into their backpacks, had a unique 19th Century vintage and is reported to have been worth €350,000 (£310,000).. The theft sparked an international police hunt that ended in July when the pair were caught while trying to cross into Croatia. . According to the El País newspaper, the pair had reportedly visited the restaurant at least three times beforehand in order to prepare for the robbery. . The couple have also been ordered to pay more than €750,000 to insurers in damages. . Their sentences are not yet final and the couple will have the opportunity to appeal them. . ",

Authorities have released very little information about their investigations and announced no arrests, but they have accused Iran's \"enemies\" of using the suspected poisonings to undermine the clerical establishment. . Some Iranians believe the girls' schools are being targeted by hard-line elements to stop them receiving an education. . Others suggest the authorities may be punishing girls for their leading role in the nationwide anti-government protests that erupted in September.. The first known case was reported at a school in the Shia holy city of Qom on 30 November, when 18 schoolgirls fell ill and were taken to hospital. .

Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei meanwhile warned that they could face the charge of \"corruption on earth\", which is punishable by death.. He also said special courts would be set up in each province to summon \"lie-spreaders and disrupters of public opinion in the case of the poisonings\". . Their remarks came a day after a series of suspected poisonings was reported in at least 15 cities and towns, with the south-western city of Ahvaz and the central city of Yazd said to have been worst affected..  that it said showed girls at Fatemieh Art School in the western city of Hamadan shouting: \"We don't want to die.\". , a woman in the northern city of Rasht said security forces had fired tear-gas at concerned mothers protesting outside the local education department..

Health Minister Bahram Eynollahi meanwhile told a conference last Tuesday that research indicated that \"a kind of mild poison caused the intoxication\".. 1500 Tasvir tweeted on Sunday that it had \"received the results of 25 blood tests from poisoned students in different cities\" and that the \"MCV number in all of them is lower than normal\". .
