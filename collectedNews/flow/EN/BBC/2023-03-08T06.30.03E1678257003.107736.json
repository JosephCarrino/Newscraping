        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Four US citizens were kidnapped by armed men on 3 March while driving into the city of Matamoros in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, across the border from Texas. . They had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.  . One man, named only as José \"N\", 24, from Tamaulipas, has been arrested.. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \"We offer our deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who were killed in these attacks.\". The two surviving victims were delivered to the US on Tuesday in co-operation with the US consulate in Matamoros, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica . .. They were brought back under armed escort by a heavily armed Mexican military convoy.. The FBI later confirmed that two Americans were found dead and that the other two have been brought to American hospitals for treatment. . \"One of the surviving victims sustained serious injuries during the attack,\" the FBI said. . The statement added that the agency will work with international partners and other law enforcement agencies to \"hold those responsible for this horrific and violent attack accountable for their crimes\".   . The bodies of Zindell Brown and Shaeed Woodard have been recovered and are being repatriated, US officials said.. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said: \"We are very sorry that this happened in our country and we send our condolences to the families of the victims, friends, and the United States government, and we will continue doing our work to guarantee peace and tranquillity.\". The injured Americans were named by family members as Latavia \"Tay\" McGee, a mother of six from South Carolina, and Eric James Williams.. The four were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said this week.. Video shows them being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men. One is manhandled on to the vehicle while others appear to be unconscious and are dragged to the truck.. A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander more than one block away, was killed in last Friday's incident.. At a news conference later on Tuesday, Mexican officials confirmed a 24-year-old man had been arrested and that the four Americans were discovered at a wooden shack outside Matamoros.. The victims had been transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday \"to create confusion\", officials say.. Investigators think the Gulf Cartel, one of the oldest organised crime groups in Mexico, is responsible for the attack, a US law enforcement source told CBS. . It is still unclear whether the Americans were ambushed, mistaken for competing drug traffickers, or were caught in cross-fire between warring factions. . US state department officials said on Tuesday that the investigation was still in the early stages. . Ms McGee was said to be travelling to the Mexican border town to have a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat.. Her mother Barbara Burgess told ABC News that she had asked her daughter not to go, but her daughter had reassured her she would be safe. . The FBI offered a $50,000 (£42,000) reward for the return of the Americans. . Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US state department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".. Medical tourism is common, particularly among people living in US border states. . But Matamoros is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, as drug cartels control large swathes of the state of Tamaulipas and can hold more power than local law enforcement.   . ",

        "content": "The storm first wreaked havoc in south-eastern Africa in late February, killing 21 people and displacing thousands in both countries.. Meteorologists say it is rare for a storm to make such a loop.. The tropical cyclone is on track to become the longest-lasting storm on record and it continues to gain strength.. The storm has already broken records for the strength it has accumulated and the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean.. Its longevity and strength have drawn the interest of weather experts globally.. The cyclone developed off the north Australian Coast in early February and then travelled thousands of kilometres across the southern Indian Ocean, affecting Mauritius and La Réunion, before making landfalls in Madagascar two weeks later and then Mozambique.. Experts say that is a very rare path for such a storm to take.. It already holds the record for highest accumulated cyclone energy in the southern hemisphere. That is a measure of a storm's strength over time.. Mozambique is now bracing for a second landfall, whilst still reeling from the rains and floods brought by the cyclone.. Madagascar received around three times its usual monthly average rainfall in the past week alone.. The Weather and Climate Extremes evaluation committee of the UN says it will probably set up an investigation into this \"remarkable\" and \"rare occurrence\" after the cyclone has dissipated.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Police in Georgia fire water cannon and pepper spray at protesters. Riot police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse the crowds outside the parliament building. . Some protesters were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags. . The government says several policemen were hurt and police gear was damaged. . There has been widespread international condemnation of the bill, which would require non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and  independent media who receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as foreign agents. . The opposition described it as a Russian-style law that would stigmatise and clamp down on Georgia's vibrant civil society and independent media.. Russia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media. . \"The law is Russian as we all know... We don't want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency. . The country's President, Salome Zourabichvili, says she supports the protesters, saying they represented what she called free Georgia which saw its future in Europe.. But inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law.. On Monday, a committee hearing into the proposed legislation ended in a parliamentary brawl. . Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\". . It added that parliament's advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia's clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\". . The two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People's Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party. . The group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). . Georgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency. . At a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy's statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. Brussels is currently considering Georgia's application for EU candidate status.. On Tuesday evening, the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the draft legislation was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report as a \"co-ordinated attempt to rig the news\".. He questioned how the US could make assumptions without an investigation.. \"Obviously, the authors of the attack want to divert attention,\" Mr Peskov told state news agency Ria-Novosti.. German media say investigators believe they have identified the boat used to plant the explosives.. Russian gas deliveries had been suspended before the blasts. Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in August last year, saying it needed maintenance. Nord Stream 2 had never been put into service. . The exact cause of the 26 September blasts that hit the natural gas pipelines is unknown, but it is widely believed they were attacked. . Moscow has blamed the West for the explosions and called on the UN Security Council to independently investigate them. . Nato and Western leaders have stopped short of directly accusing Russia of attacking its own pipelines, although the EU has previously said Russia uses its gas pipelines as a weapon against the West.. On Tuesday, . that new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group had carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. . Citing anonymous US officials, the report said there was no evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation.. The US newspaper reported that the officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or \"any details of the strength of the evidence it contains\".. It added: \"Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two.\". Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the Ukrainian government \"was absolutely not involved\" in the sabotage. In a statement in response to the New York Times report, Mr Podolyak added that Kyiv had no information about what had happened.. Also on Tuesday, German newspaper Die Zeit reported that German authorities had made a breakthrough in their investigation into the cause of the attacks.. According to joint research published by the paper and other German media organisations, the boat used to plant the explosives was a yacht hired from a firm based in Poland, which reportedly belonged to two Ukrainians. The nationalities of those who carried out the attack were unclear. . However, the paper says German investigators have not yet found any evidence as to who ordered the destruction. It also points out that there is still the possibility of a false flag operation which was intended to point towards Ukraine. . At least 50m (164ft) of the underwater Nord Stream 1 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany is thought to have been destroyed by September's blast.. Danish police believe \"powerful explosions\" blew four holes in the pipe and its newer twin, Nord Stream 2.. German, Danish and Swedish authorities have all been investigating the incident. . Mr Peskov said Nord Stream shareholder countries should insist on an urgent, transparent investigation.. \"We are still not allowed in the investigation,\" he said. \"Only a few days ago we received notes about this from the Danes and Swedes. This is not just strange. It smells like a monstrous crime.\". For decades, Russia supplied huge amounts of natural gas to Western Europe. But after the war in Ukraine began in February of last year, most EU countries drastically reduced their reliance on Russian energy. . This video can not be played.
