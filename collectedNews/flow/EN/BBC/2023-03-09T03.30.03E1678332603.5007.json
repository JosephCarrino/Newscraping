        "content": "He detailed a period of chaos and unpreparedness in the days after the Taliban captured Kabul. . Others spoke of enduring trauma and moral injury in the aftermath.. Sgt Vargas-Andrews, 25, was one of several US military personnel tasked with protecting Kabul's airport on 26 August 2021, when two suicide bombers attacked crowds of Afghans trying to flee the Taliban during the US evacuation. . Thirteen US soldiers died in the bombing, along with 170 Afghan civilians. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews testified that he and another marine had received intelligence about the bombing before it occurred, and that he had spotted the suspect in the crowd. . He said he had alerted his supervisors and requested permission to act but had never received it. . \"Plain and simple, we were ignored,\" Sgt Vargas-Andrews said. . In emotional testimony, he described being thrown in the air during the bombing and opening his eyes to see his comrades dead or lying unconscious around him. . \"My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearings and shrapnel,\" he said. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews called the withdrawal a \"catastrophe,\" adding: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability and negligence.\". \"I see the faces of all of those we could not save, those we left behind,\" he said.. The House Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into the evacuation from Afghanistan also heard from other US soldiers and veterans who spoke of the mental health toll that the withdrawal has had on them. . Retired Lt Col David Scott Mann, who worked to evacuate Afghans at the time, testified that the experience working to get allies out had been \"gutting\". . He added that calls to the Veteran Affairs hotline spiked 81% after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and he warned that the US was on the \"front end of a mental health tsunami\". . He said a friend he had served with had died by suicide in the aftermath. . \"He just couldn't find his way out of the darkness of that moral injury,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Testimony from the majority of witnesses placed the blame on every presidential administration since US troops were first deployed to Afghanistan, from George W Bush to Joe Biden. . Witnesses also urged for immediate action to help Afghan allies who had worked with US soldiers who are now in limbo both in Afghanistan and in the US. . \"America is building a nasty reputation for multi-generational systemic abandonment of our allies where we leave a smouldering human refuse, from the Montagnards of Vietnam to the Kurds in Syria,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Republicans who had long pushed for an investigation placed the blame on the Biden administration.. Panel chairman Mike McCaul, a House Republican from Texas, said the withdrawal had been a \"systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level, and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration\".. In response, Democrats spoke out in defence of President Biden. . House representative Gregory Meeks from New York said that Mr Biden had \"made the right decision to bring all our troops home\". . \"I can't in good conscience imagine sending more American men and women to fight in Afghanistan.\". Mr Biden had previously said that he bore \"responsibility for fundamentally all that has happened\" but he also blamed former President Donald Trump for overseeing the withdrawal deal with the Taliban..

        "content": "Watch: Police car flipped over as Georgians stay defiant on streets. The crowds are angry at a controversial Russian-style law, which would class non-government and media groups as \"foreign agents\" if they receive more than 20% of their funds from abroad.. On Wednesday evening, police pushed back protesters who pulled down a metal barrier outside parliament. . The crowds were ordered to disperse and some people have been injured.. Pictures from Georgian TV showed hundreds of riot police on the streets late on Wednesday night, wearing helmets and holding shields. At least one police car had been overturned. . Clouds of tear gas rose above the streets around the parliament building as police tried to break up the protests. . Earlier, tens of thousands of people joined the second day of protests. . They took place outside parliament, where on Tuesday lawmakers backed a first reading of the controversial new law, which has been widely condemned internationally. . A similar law in Russia has been used to severely limit press freedom and supress civil society. . \"We think that our government is under Russian influence and it's very bad for our future,\" said Lizzie, one of many students taking part in the protests.. The protesters worry that the new law, if passed, would damage the country's hopes of joining the EU. . \"People are really angry because this is not about one specific thing, it's about the future of Georgia and it's about how we'll function as a country,\" another demonstrator named Tekla Tevdorashvili told the BBC.. \"Everyone is really against this and I think that's why they're so afraid and that's why the government is trying to use everything that they can against the people to silence us but we will not be silenced.\". In a statement, the US expressed solidarity with the protesters and called on Georgia's government to allow peaceful demonstrations.. \"We urge the government of Georgia to respect the freedom of peaceful assembly and peaceful protests,\" state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. \"We are standing with the people of Georgia and the aspirations that they have.\". Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, also expressed his support for the Georgian people. . Authorities said 55 police were hurt during the first night of protests, when stones and petrol bombs were thrown at them. Some of the most arresting images of Tuesday night came when a water cannon was sprayed at protesters waving EU flags. . Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili denounced the \"stir\" over the draft law, which went through its first reading inside parliament on Tuesday. Ruling party Georgian Dream maintains the legislation dates back to US legislation in the 1930s. The same argument was used by Russia after it passed a similar law in 2012.. Russia's law has since been expanded to suppress Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers. Anyone identified as a foreign agent now has to highlight a foreign-agent label on their publication.. Opposition-supporting TV stations have also dubbed the proposed legislation as a \"Russian law\". . Georgia has applied to the European Union for candidate status and also aims to join Nato, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Another student, Lia Chagovadze, said she and her friends were there to fight for Western values and freedom, while Nanuka Shakinovi said the protesters would not allow the government to stop Georgia's push to join the EU: \"We are going to fight them and we will not stop until we win.\". \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old Luka Kimeridze.. Georgian Dream chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said criticism of the draft law as similar to Russia's own repressive legislation was misleading. \"In the end, the stir will die out and the public will have transparency in the funding of NGOs,\" he said.. However, Eka Gigauri of Transparency International told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Political tensions in Georgia have been heightened by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seen by many Georgians as a war of aggression by Moscow, and many thousands of Russians have fled there. However, the government in Tbilisi has adopted a neutral stance, refusing to openly back Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia.. Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". She has vowed to veto the legislation, but Georgian Dream has enough votes to override the president's veto in parliament. The party has applied to the Council of Europe for its opinion.. Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. ",

        "content": "The warming gas can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored safely and cheaply in seawater. . The new method could speed up the deployment of carbon removal technology, experts say.. While the world has struggled to limit and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in recent decades, several companies have instead focussed on developing technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.. Climeworks in Switzerland is perhaps the best known. Over the past ten years it has developed machines to suck in the air from the atmosphere that filter and trap the carbon dioxide molecules. . At a .  the captured CO2 is injected deep underground where it is permanently turned into stone. . The company has recently started selling a certified carbon removal service to large corporate clients including Microsoft, Spotify and Stripe.. However, one big problem for most current approaches to direct air capture is cost. . CO2, although a powerful warming agent, is relatively diluted in the atmosphere at around 400 parts per million (ppm) in air. . So big machines that require large amounts of energy are needed to both absorb and discharge the CO2. . This new approach, using off-the-shelf resins and other chemicals, promises far greater efficiency and lower cost, say the scientists involved.. The research team have borrowed an approach used for applications in water, and \"tweaked\" existing materials to remove CO2 from the air. . In tests, the new hybrid absorbing material was able to take in three times as much CO2 as existing substances.. \"To my knowledge, there is no absorbing material which even at 100,000 ppm, shows the capacity we get it in direct air capture of 400 ppm,\" said lead author Prof Arup SenGupta from Lehigh University in the US.. \"This simple ability to capture CO2 at a high quantity, in a small volume of material, is a unique aspect of our work.\" . The development, while in its early stages, has been welcomed by others in the field.. \"I am happy to see this paper in the published literature, it is very exciting, and it stands a good chance of transforming the CO2 capture efforts,\" said Prof Catherine Peters from Princeton University, an expert in geological engineering, who wasn't involved in the research project.. \"What is clever about this is that the starting point was a technology previously designed for applications in water. This advance applies this technology to the gas phase - a new idea.\". \"The demonstrated performance for CO2 capture is promising.\". One of the big challenges in capturing CO2 is what to do with the trapped gas. . Storing it under the ground or sea in former oil wells is one widely used approach. But the new paper suggests that with the addition of some chemicals the captured CO2 can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored simply and safely in sea water. . Dr SenGupta says he now wants to establish a spin-off company to develop the technology further. . He believes that removing CO2 in this way will not only be critical to limiting the rise in global temperatures but could also be directly empowering for developing countries. . \"We have to take it to places like Bangladesh, Barbados or the Maldives, they also have a role to play, they cannot be just bystanders who keep suffering.\". Some scientists are reluctant to put too much emphasis on new and emerging technologies like direct air capture because they fear that it could dilute the carbon cutting efforts of governments and individuals.. But with the temperature thresholds of the Paris climate agreement under threat from rising emissions, many others feel that the rapid deployment of direct air capture in addition to massive cuts in carbon is the best hope of avoiding dangerous climate change. . \"It has become even more important now that we are definitely in an overshoot regime, where we have to take carbon back from the environment,\" said Prof Klaus Lackner, a pioneer in the field of removing CO2.. \"DAC will have to get cheaper to make a useful contribution. I am optimistic that it can do this.\". Professor SenGupta shares that optimism, believing that this new approach can remove CO2 for less than $100 a tonne.. The research has been .  in the journal, Science Advances. . ",

It was valued at nearly $1.5m.. , 92.4% of home appraisers are white.. In 2021, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation released a study of 12 million appraisals over five years, showing that homes in black and Hispanic neighbourhoods were routinely undervalued.. Ms Tate-Austin and Mr Austin bought the house in 2016 in the San Francisco suburb of Marin City for about $550,000. . The city has a large African-American population (38%), compared with the predominantly white Marin County, where it is situated, in which only 2.8% of the population is black.. In 2020, when interest rates were historically low, the couple decided to refinance their mortgage.. The year before, a company had appraised their four-bedroom property for $1,450,000, after they made major improvements, including adding square-footage. . But when they decided to refinance again in 2020 to take advantage of low rates, they were appraised for just $995,000.. So they came up with an experiment. What if their friend, a white woman, posed as the homeowner instead? . They removed all trace of themselves from their home, including their African-themed artwork and their photographs. . The process is known as \"white-washing\", and black homeowners across the country have reported doing it in order to sell their properties.. Several weeks after their first estimate, a different appraiser toured the house for the decoy white homeowner. . This time, it was appraised at $1,482,500 - almost half a million dollars more than the initial estimate, . .. \"You feel a sense of relief like, 'I told you.' Then you just feel a sense of sadness,\" Ms Tate-Austin told the BBC's broadcast partner CBS News in 2021. . \"We had to do what we had to do in order to have our house appraised for what it should have appraised for from the start.. \"I mean, it's the financial impact, but it's the emotional impact. It's the feeling every day like, the tax of being African-American in this country, like you don't know, it's a coin toss.\" . The couple sued the first appraisal company for violating the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits housing discrimination.. The lawsuit was settled on Wednesday for an undisclosed amount. . As part of the agreement, the defendants do not have to admit any liability in the case, but will have to watch a documentary about discriminatory real estate and attend a training session on the history of racial discrimination in real estate..
