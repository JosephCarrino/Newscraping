        "content": "But at a meeting in Switzerland to agree their findings, climate scientists warned a key global temperature goal will likely be missed.. Their report lays out how rapid cuts to fossil fuels can avert the worst effects of climate change. . In response to the findings, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres says that all countries should bring forward their net zero plans by a decade. These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.. \"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.. The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.. \"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. . The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.. Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. . It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. . By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.. Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. . \"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.. \"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.. \"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\". The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. . And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. . \"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.. \"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\". The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". . The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. . They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. . But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.. Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.. Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. . \"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.. ",

Kenya's highest court upheld his victory in last year's election, but Mr Odinga insists that the election was \"stolen\". . He has been driving through Nairobi's residential suburbs to rally his supporters and has vowed to organise weekly protests against the government. . It has caused many businesses to shut in the city, due to fears of looting.. Running battles have taken place on the main Kenyatta Avenue between police and demonstrators, some of whom are throwing stones at the security officers.. Roads leading to key government buildings have been blocked and the president's official residence sealed off. . Mr Odinga's convoy was tear-gassed by police as he left a hotel after addressing the media. Hundreds of his supporters were part of the procession.. that the opposition leader's vehicle had been hit by a bullet.. \"Our windscreen has been badly damaged,\" Prof Makau Mutua said. He did not give further details, and it is unclear exactly where the alleged incident took place. . Police had earlier denied the opposition permission to hold the protest, and warned that any gathering would be illegal. . Some of the fiercest scenes have been in Nairobi's Kibera settlement - a poor neighbourhood with a strong history of supporting the opposition.. \"We came here peacefully, but they tear-gassed us,\" 21-year-old Charles Oduor told the AFP news agency in another district of Nairobi. . \"They lie to us everyday. Where is the cheap maize flour they promised? Where are the jobs for the youth they promised? All they do is hire their friends.\". Riot police have also confronted protesters in the western town of Kisumu, where Mr Odinga draws a fanatical following.. Footage shared by Kenya's Standard newspaper earlier on Monday appears to show . . . Meanwhile, an opposition party in South Africa, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), has also organised anti-government protests, demanding that the president step down over the worsening economy, power cuts, and widespread corruption.. Similar demonstrations have been planned in Senegal and Tunisia, marking growing dissatisfaction with sitting presidents. . ",

        "content": "Foreign minister Ali Sabry told the BBC the government will raise funds by restructuring state-owned enterprises and privatising the national airline.. However, analysts warned Sri Lanka still faces a tough road ahead.. The country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices, and populist tax cuts.  . A shortage of medicines, fuel and other essentials also helped to push the cost of living to record highs, triggering nationwide protests with inflation running at more than 50%.. As a result .  with international lenders last May for the first time in its history.. \"We have lived beyond our means. Whether we like it or not, these difficult measures which may be very unpopular need to be taken,\" Mr Sabry said in an interview before the funding was announced.. \"Luckily, most [people] other than politically-motivated unions have understood that. I know they are not happy, but they also understand we have no choice,\" Mr Sabry added.. Earlier this year the country introduced income taxes for professionals, ranging from 12.5% to more than 36%.. It also raised other taxes to pay for critical purchases, including fuel and food.. This is in stark contrast from the big tax cuts former Sri Lanka president Gotabaya Rajapaksa introduced in 2019, which lost the government income of more than $1.4bn (£1.14bn) a year.. Andrew Wood, analyst at the S&P Global Ratings agency, said: \"Sri Lanka still faces a long road toward consolidation of its government balance sheet, consistent economic growth, and external stability.. \"We expect the economy to contract again in 2023, albeit at a more modest pace, before returning to growth in 2024.\". Earlier this month, the IMF said Sri Lanka had secured financing assurances from all its major creditors, including China and India, which paved the way for the bailout.. Mr Sabry said it was \"a little premature\" to discuss if China - Sri Lanka's biggest bilateral lender - would consider writing-off some of the country's debts.. \"We have the will to pay, but we don't have the capacity to pay. What we are now trying to do is get that capacity back,\" he said. . \"That's going to be a very difficult and serious discussion.\" . The Sri Lankan government had initially hoped to agree a new payment plan with China and India by the end of 2022.. Beijing's lending to Sri Lanka stands at around $7bn (£5.71bn) while India is owed around $1bn (£820m).. This video can not be played.

If the no-confidence motions succeed, President Emmanuel Macron would not be at risk of losing his job, but the positions of Ms Borne and the government would be jeopardised.. Mr Macron could either name a new government or dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections.. The pension reform bill would also be nullified.. If the no-confidence motions are unsuccessful, the bill to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 will become law.. Mr Macron has argued that France's ageing population makes the current pension scheme unaffordable. . But that is not a sentiment shared by all in parliament. . The author of one of the two no-confidence votes, Charles de Courson, said removing the government was \"the only way of stopping the social and political crisis in this country\", AFP reported.. Mr Macron's allies are in a minority in the lower house of the National Assembly, but for the no-confidence motions to succeed, all of the opposition would have to unite. . France's Republican party holds 61 seats, and last week their leader, Eric Ciotti, said they would not support the no-confidence motions.. Mr Ciotti said the decision to invoke the clause was \"a result of many years of political failures\" that demonstrated \"a profound crisis in our constitution\", but he did not believe the vote of no confidence was the solution. . But one senior Republican, Aurelien Pradie said he would vote against the government. . The decision to use 49:3 has angered many in France, with protesters clashing with police at the weekend over the reforms. Thousands lit fires around the country and some threw firecrackers at police.. Mr Ciotti said people.  with other MPs in favour of the bill saying they received death threats. . The strikes are set to continue in opposition to the proposed raising of the retirement age.. ",
