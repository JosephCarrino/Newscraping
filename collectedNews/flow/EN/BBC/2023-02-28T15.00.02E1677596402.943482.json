        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis. The bill strips power uniquely held by Disney for over 50 years and enables more oversight by Mr DeSantis' Republican-led legislature.. The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education.. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis.. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World.. \"There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\". For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department.. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 sq miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year.. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state.. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes.. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (Â£41,467) to Mr DeSantis' re-election campaign.. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed.. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\".. Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.. Friction between Disney, one of the world's biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April.. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under.. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content.. Mr DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power.. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that's happened over the past couple of years, I've always been very proud of our parks,\" he said.. \"It's almost like a rite of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you've got to have people who can tell you the truth.\".

The ransomware attack was discovered on 17 February, the USMS said.. \"Shortly after that discovery, the USMS disconnected the affected system, and the Department of Justice initiated a forensic investigation,\" said Drew Wade, spokesperson for the US Marshals Service. . Mr Wade said that hackers were able to access sensitive data, like law enforcement information on ongoing legal procedures, personal information of some employees, and information about wanted fugitives. . But the witness protection programme was not compromised, a senior official told CNN.. The USMS is overseen by the Department of Justice, who deemed the breach a \"major incident\" on 22 February. . Under US policy, this classification means that the breach likely caused harm to US national security, foreign relations, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or the public health and safety of Americans. . Mr Wade said the Department continues to look into the breach and that remediation efforts are ongoing. . \"We are working swiftly and effectively to mitigate any potential risks as a result of the incident,\" he said..

        "content": "\"It became evident that some people wanted all schools, especially girls' schools, to be closed down,\" the deputy health minister said on Sunday.. However, he later said that his remarks had been misinterpreted.. The prosecutor general announced last week that he was opening a criminal investigation, but he said that the available information only indicated \"the possibility of criminal and premeditated acts\".. Meanwhile, public frustration is continuing to grow.. The first poisoning took place on 30 November, when 18 students from the Nour Technical School in the religious city of Qom were taken to hospital.. Since then, more than 10 girls' schools have been targeted in the surrounding province.. At least 194 girls are reported to have been poisoned in the past week at four schools in the city of Borujerd, in the western province of Lorestan.. The poisoned girls have reported the smell of tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill. . Earlier this month, at least 100 people protested outside the governor's office in Qom.. \"You are obliged to ensure my children's safety! I have two daughters,\" one father shouted in a video widely shared on social media. \"Two daughters... and all I can do is not let them go to school.\". \"This is a war!\" declared a woman. \"They are doing this in a girls' high school in Qom to force us to sit at home. They want girls to stay at home.\" . Some parents have said their children were ill for weeks after the poisoning.. Another video from a hospital shows a teenage girl lying dazed on a bed, with her mother beside her.. \"Dear mothers, I'm a mother and my child is in a hospital bed and her limbs are weak,\" says the distraught mother. \"I pinch her but she doesn't feel anything. Please don't send your children to school.\". At a news conference on Sunday, Deputy Health Minister Younes Panahi said the girls had been poisoned by chemicals that \"are not military grade and are publicly available\".. \"The pupils do not need any invasive treatment and it's necessary to maintain calm,\" he added.. Dr Panahi's comment that it was \"evident that some people wanted all schools... to be closed down\" appeared to confirm the government believed the poisonings were premeditated. . His subsequent denial suggested splits among officials over how to handle public anger when no suspects have been identified.. The poisonings have notably been concentrated in Qom, a city that is home to important Shia Muslim shrines and the religious leadership that forms the backbone of the Islamic Republic.. Since September, the clerical establishment has been challenged by the mass protests that erupted after the death in custody of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf \"properly\".. Some Iranians have speculated that if the schoolgirls are being poisoned as \"payback\" for their role in the unrest. Social media was flooded with videos showing schoolgirls ripping off their headscarves and chanting anti-establishment slogans.. Others have speculated that the poisonings are the work of hardliners who want to \"copy\" the Taliban in Afghanistan and the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria by terrorising parents to stop sending their girls to school. . \"Has Boko Haram come to Iran?\" former Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi asked in an Instagram post. . The reformist politician also warned that \"extremists will interpret the boundaries of government and religion in their favour\".. Iran's leaders have traditionally rejected criticism of its restrictions on women, such as the mandatory headscarf, and instead boasted about the number of women who attend university. But if young girls do not finish school, college is just a dream.. The comments of one schoolgirl, who says she has been poisoned twice, at the meeting with Qom's governor earlier this month highlighted how vague and misleading some of the statements from the authorities have been.. \"They [officials] tell us: 'All is good, we've done our investigation.' But when my father asked at my school, they told him: 'Sorry, the CCTV has been down for a week and we can't investigate this,'\" she said.. \"And when I was poisoned for the second time on Sunday, the school principal said: 'She has a heart condition, that's why she is hospitalised.' But I don't have any heart condition!\" . ",
