        "content": "But military leaders decided against shooting it down as there were concerns over the danger of falling debris.. China has not yet commented.. US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the situation.. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, officials said.. A senior defence official speaking on condition of anonymity said the government prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, in case the White House ordered the object to be shot down.. Top military leaders, including Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, met on Wednesday to assess the threat. Mr Austin was travelling in the Philippines at the time.. But they advised against taking \"kinetic action\" against the balloon because of the danger falling debris might pose to people on the ground.. Montana, a sparsely populated state, is home to one of only three nuclear missile silo fields in the country, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, and officials said the apparent spy craft was flying over sensitive sites to collect information.. The defence official, however, said there was no \"significantly enhanced threat\" of US intelligence being compromised because American officials \"know exactly where this balloon is and exactly where it's passing over\".. He added that there was also no threat to civilian aviation as the balloon was \"significantly\" above the altitude used by commercial airlines. . The defence official said the US had raised the matter with Chinese officials in their embassy in Washington DC and in Beijing.. During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location. They also refused to provide more details of the object, including its size. . \"There have been reports of pilots seeing this thing even though it's pretty high up in the sky,\" the unnamed defence official said. \"So you know, it's sizable.\". They added that such surveillance balloons had been tracked in the past several years, but this one was \"appearing to hang out for a longer period of time this time around\".. It confused social media users in Montana, with some posting images of a pale round object high in the sky. Others reported seeing US military planes in the area, apparently monitoring the object.. Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the \"big white circle in the sky\" and went home to get a better camera. . \"I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,\" he said. \"So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.\". Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, slammed China's alleged balloon.. \"The level of espionage aimed at our country by Beijing has grown dramatically more intense & brazen over the last 5 years,\" he tweeted.. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, a Republican, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"deeply troubling\" situation.. Speaking at an unrelated event in Washington DC on Thursday, CIA Director William Burns made no mention of the balloon, but called China the \"biggest geopolitical challenge\" currently facing the US.. The alleged spy craft is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary.. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.. He will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, the .

        "content": "The news comes just two weeks after Spike the Chihuahua, 23, was given the record for the oldest living dog. . The previous oldest dog ever was Australia's Bluey, who died in 1939 at the age of 29 years and five months. . As of 1 February, Bobi was 30 years and 226 days old. . This has been validated by the Portuguese government's pet database, which is managed by the National Union of Veterinarians, according to Guinness World Records. . He has lived his whole life with the Costa family in the village of Conqueiros, near Portugal's west coast, after being born with three siblings in an outbuilding.. Leonel Costa, who was eight years old at the time, said his parents had too many animals and had to put the puppies down, but Bobi escaped. . Leonel and his brothers kept the dog's existence a secret from their parents until he was eventually discovered and became part of the family, who feed him the same food they eat.. \"Between a can of animal food or a piece of meat, Bobi doesn't hesitate and chooses our food,\" said Mr Costa, who always soaks the food in water to remove most of the seasoning. . Apart from a scare in 2018 when he was hospitalised after suddenly collapsing due to breathing difficulty, Mr Costa says Bobi has enjoyed a relatively trouble-free life and believes the secret to his longevity is the \"calm, peaceful environment\" he lives in. . It may also be in the blood - Bobi's mother living to the age of 18. . However, time has taken its toll on Bobi, who now has trouble walking and worsening eyesight.. Mr Costa says Bobi is the \"last of a long generation of animals\" in the Costa family and describes him as \"one of a kind.\". ",

        "content": "Mr Kyrgios pushed Chiara Passari onto the pavement during a row in Canberra in 2021, the court heard.. The magistrate called the incident \"a single act of stupidity or frustration\" when sparing him a criminal record.. Agreed facts tendered to the court say Mr Kyrgios pushed Ms Passari after after she stopped his car from driving away while they were arguing on 10 January 2021.. Ms Passari reported the incident to police the next month but did not make a formal complaint. The couple reconciled and resumed a relationship, but after they broke up, Ms Passari made a formal complaint in December 2021.. Lawyer Michael Kukulies-Smith argued Mr Kyrgios had been trying to de-escalate the fight by calling an Uber, and had repeatedly tried to \"lawfully\" move Ms Passari away from the car before the incident.. \"It is in that context and the frustration that resulted, that my client reacted and the offence occurred,\" he said.. \"There is a relationship between the mental health and the offending - even though he no longer suffers it to the same extent today.\". Mr Kyrgios apologised the next day, showing his acceptance of responsibility to Ms Passari, Mr Kukulies-Smith added.. When sentencing Mr Kygrios, Magistrate Beth Campbell said he had been \"a young man trying to extricate himself from a heighted emotional situation\". . \"You acted in the heat of the moment,\" she said.. \"I am dealing with you in the same way I would deal with any young man in this court. You are a young man who happens to hit a tennis ball particularly well.\". She told Mr Kyrgios that references from family showed he had a lot of \"love and support\" around him.. ",
