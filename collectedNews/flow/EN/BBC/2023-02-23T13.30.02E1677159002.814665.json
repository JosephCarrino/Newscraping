        "content": "It comes after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and Canadian airspace before it was shot down by the US military. . China has also been recently accused of interfering with Canadian elections. . Monitoring buoys were discovered and retrieved last fall as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the country's security by surveilling air, land and sea domains.. A spokesperson for Canada's Department of National Defence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, said in a statement that the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches\". . Mr Le Bouthillier added that China does this using \"dual-purpose technologies\", meaning devices that conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes. . He said the military has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory since 2022, but did not elaborate on their nature.. China has long displayed interest in the Arctic. It has sent high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and participates in most major Arctic institutions. . It has also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north, often for research expeditions.. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate change, and gain access to emerging resources.. But experts say that China's research interests in the region have also doubled as attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.. Their efforts are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US, Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped potential in the region.. \"This is a part of the world that has not been mapped and understood to the same degree of detail as other latitudes,\" said Roberto Mazzolin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a former high-ranking official in the Canadian Armed Forces. . Mr Mazzolin said Canada has historically looked at the Arctic as a safe area with little potential for threat. But interest in the region by Russia, and more recently China, has changed that.. \"[Canada is forced to] look at how we would posture our own security, our military defence, or our economic development activities to secure Canadian and American interests,\" he said. . On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that she views China as an increasingly disruptive power. . Ms Joly added that Canada is working closely with the US to protect North American airspace, as well as Canada's Arctic sovereignty.. The Canadian military's discovery of the Chinese buoys comes at the heels of revelations by Canadian intelligence that China had tried to interfere in Canada's last federal election in 2021. . In documents first reported on by the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service outlined China's efforts to re-elect Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority of government, and to ensure the defeat of Conservative politicians who are seen as unfriendly to China.. It did so through cash donations to preferred candidates, the spread of disinformation and using consulates and paid students to help certain Liberal candidates, according to reporting by the Globe. . Canadian parliamentarians are in the midst of probing allegations that China interfered in Canada's 2019 federal election. On Tuesday, they expanded their scope to include the 2021 election as well. . On Wednesday, Prime Minister Trudeau called the suspected Chinese election interference \"an extraordinarily serious issue\", and said he supported a further probe into these reports. . He added the meddling efforts so far appear to have been unsuccessful, but still raise concern that foreign countries are trying to interfere with Canada's democratic processes. . \"Foreign actors are trying to undermine people's confidence in democracy itself,\" Mr Trudeau said.. Chinese officials in Canada have denied these reports, saying they do not interfere in Canadian election or internal affairs. Earlier this month, China's suspected surveillance efforts in North America dominated headlines after a Chinese balloon was discovered flying over North America.. Both the US and Canada said that the balloon was spying on sensitive military assets. China, however, has denied it was used for surveillance, instead saying it was a civilian weather balloon that had blown off course.. ",

        "content": "The two Spectrum News 13 journalists were covering the killing of a woman in the area that morning when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . Spectrum News 13 identified the reporter as 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, who was killed, and photojournalist Jesse Walden who was injured. . The other two killed in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have not yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",

Clay Jacke announced Holder's 60 years to life sentence on Wednesday after hearing from one of Hussle's friends as well as reading a letter from Holder's father. . Holder was found guilty of murder as well as two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter for the two bystanders injured in the shooting after a months-long trial. . He was not eligible for the death penalty and was widely expected to receive a life sentence. . Wearing orange jail attire, he did not react when his sentence was read out.. Holder's attorney told ABC News he planned to appeal the verdict. . \"It was always going to be tough given the high-profile circumstances surrounding the case,\" the attorney, Aaron Jansen, said.. Prosecutors said during the murder trial that the attack was premeditated, while Holder's defence team argued it was a heat-of-the-moment decision. . Holder's defence attorney said he was provoked by a conversation he had with Hussle about rumours that he was cooperating with police..

        "content": "Official figures published last month showed Japan's rate of inflation was at its highest level in over 40 years.. That has put pressure on businesses and authorities to help people as their spending power shrinks.. Each year Japanese firms typically hold pay talks with unions for weeks before announcing their decisions around the middle of March..

On Wednesday, Toyota said it will meet union demands for pay and bonuses, with wages increasing by the most in 20 years.. Toyota's incoming president Koji Sato said that he hoped the move would have a positive impact across the Japan's motor industry and \"lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company.\". The company declined to provide further details when approached by the BBC.. Meanwhile, rival car maker Honda told the BBC that it had \"fully answered\" union requests for wage increases and bonuses.. The company said it will raise salaries by 5%, marking the biggest increase since 1990 and above Japan's rate of inflation..
