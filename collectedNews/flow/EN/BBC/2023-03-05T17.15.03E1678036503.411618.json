        "content": "In the past few weeks, accusations have flown between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova over alleged .  and warnings about the potential for conflict to erupt here again.. Moldova's prime minister, Dorin Recean, has said Russian troops should be expelled from the region, amid warnings from President Maia Sandu that Moscow is planning to topple her pro-western government.. Russia, meanwhile, has been talking up the threat of a \"false flag\" attack by Ukrainian forces - and warned that any attack on its troops in Transnistria would be seen as an attack on Russia itself.. Many western analysts point out that Transnistria could provide Russia with another entry point into Ukraine, forcing Ukrainian troops away from other areas of fighting.. So Transnistria - controlled by pro-Russian separatists since .  - is being closely watched globally, but also by those much closer to home.. The warnings and threats about fresh conflict here hang heavy over the village of Molovata Noua.. This is a tiny Moldovan enclave, jammed up against Transnistrian territory and separated from the rest of Moldova by the River Dneister.. If residents of Chisinau feel vulnerable, residents of Molovata Noua feel completely exposed.. Many of the older men here fought pro-Russian separatists for this land 30 years ago. They're wondering now if they'll have to fight here again.. On Friday, veterans of that conflict gathered in Molovata Noua for an annual pilgrimage across the line of control into Transnistria, to honour those who died.. Two dozen men in military fatigues, bright medals on their chests and darkness behind their eyes. Among them, 62-year-old Vlad Untila.. \"We're lucky that Ukraine is defending us at the moment,\" he said, \"but if it kicks off in Moldova, we're ready to defend this territory again.\". Their convoy of cars makes its way down the deserted dirt road from Molovata Noua into the breakaway pro-Russian territory - crossing into enemy territory as they did three decades ago.. \"See how they look at us,\" Vlad growls, as his car approaches the Russian checkpoint.  . A gaggle of armed soldiers eye the convoy, as it carries men in Moldovan military fatigues into separatist territory, turning a blind eye to this eye-catching annual ritual.. \"Look around you,\" Vlad says, \"this is where we fought - it was all a battlefield.\". Now the narrow dirt road cuts through the silent countryside, flanked by brown fields and broken winter trees.. \"It's hard because I feel I'm in my own country,\" his friend Constantin joins in. \"It's my own land, and yet I can't walk freely here.\". A short drive beyond the checkpoint, hidden in brambles by the side of the road, is the first stop on the pilgrimage - a simple blue cross made from metal poles.. It marks the spot, 31 years ago, where a local mayor was killed.  The veterans gather round with a garland of flowers and a plastic bottle full of wine, to toast their fallen comrades.. They follow the trail of pale blue monuments dotted through this territory, repeating the ritual at every stop, honouring their comrades, siblings, and friends.. \"We were both snipers,\" Vlad remembers, at the spot his friend Vasea was killed. \"They were shooting at us from that hill over there, from a tank. One of the shrapnel fragments hit him in the neck. He fell to the ground and died in my arms.\". As the veterans pass a local Moldovan school, pupils come out to greet them, led by their headmistress Tatiana Rosca.. \"There were big battles here in 1992,\" Tatiana says.  \"And there are still deep wounds in the souls of the people.  We're very afraid: we know what war means and we don't wish it on anyone.\". One of her pupils says she's ready to take up arms if conflict erupts again, as her father and grandfather did 30 years ago.. But loyalties here - as in the rest of Moldova - are complicated by history, geography and economics.  . Here on the other side of the River Dniester, the pull of Moldovan identity is set against the pull of subsidised Russian gas from Transnistria.. The economic gulf with the rest of the country has widened since the start of the war in Ukraine, after Moscow cut gas supplies to Moldova last year.. \"I'll be honest,\" the mayor of Molovata Noua, Oleg Gazea, told me. \"It's very difficult to convince people that life is better in Moldova when they pay a fraction of the price for gas here.\". \"We can't talk about freedom and a better life, and at the same time tell them to go across the river and pay 30 times more for their bills - they'll tell us: are you crazy? But there's a hidden price [to the cheap gas] - it buys their support.\". Some people here firmly believe that Moscow is not a military threat, but an economic ally - and that president Maia Sandu is the one provoking a war by moving closer to the West.. \"Transnistria is really sticking up for us,\" 59 year old Maria Ursachi tells me.  . \"But Moldova is a disappointment. People are afraid to come over the river to talk to us: they have a border control post there and they check our bags. Chisinau doesn't see us.\". Arriving back in Molovata Noua, the veterans end their pilgrimage in the village square by laying red carnations at a memorial to the frozen conflict here.. In the years since they fought the pro-Russian separatists, their children have grown up alongside Russian soldiers, Russian language and Russian economic support.. \"We older men will still form the heart of any resistance\", Vlad tells me, \"even with the involvement of younger men.\". Memories of the past, that linger in this tiny Moldovan enclave, are being sharpened by growing fears for the future. . ",

        "content": "They will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.. The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.. But this year's sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions. . They will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while \"strengthening party-building work\" in private businesses, according to state media.. The moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party's control of the private sector.. This comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was .  in the tech sector.. This week's NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi's leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.. He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party . . . It was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China's first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.. Mr Xi's appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.. At the start of the meeting, it was announced that China will pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year, while defence spending is to rise by more than 7%.. Abroad, Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.. The NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China's equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.. Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi's most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines. . Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October's party congress, will deliver his last work report speech. . The political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi's cabinet, will also be announced.. Many will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.. Observers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.. ",

The cause of the fire is not yet clear and no casualties have been reported.. The blaze started at about 14:45 local time (08: 45 GMT) and quickly tore through the bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters, an official said.. \"Some 2,000 shelters have been burnt, leaving about 12,000 forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals shelterless,\" Mijanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee commissioner, told AFP news agency.. The blaze was brought under control within three hours but at least 35 mosques and 21 learning centres for the refugees were also destroyed, he added.. Hrusikesh Harichandan, from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the BBC there had been \"massive damage\" to the camp.. He said basic services such as water centres and testing facilities had also been affected.. \"My shelter was gutted. [My shop] was also burnt,\" Mamun Johar, a 30-year-old Rohingya man, told AFP.. \"The fire took everything from me, everything.\". Thick black clouds were seen rising above Camp 11, one of many in the border district where more than a million Rohingya refugees live. . The camps, overcrowded and squalid, are vulnerable to fires.. Between January 2021 and December 2022, there were 222 fire incidents in the Rohingya camps including 60 cases of arson, according to a Bangladesh defence ministry report released last month..

The refugee camp, said to be the world's largest, houses people who fled from Myanmar following a military crackdown against the Rohingya ethnic minority.. The Rohingya are Muslims in largely Buddhist Myanmar, where they have faced persecution for generations.. The latest exodus of Rohingya escaping to Bangladesh began in August 2017, after Myanmar's military brutally retaliated when a Rohingya insurgent group launched attacks on several police posts.. ",

        "content": "The agreement was reached on Saturday evening, after 38 hours of talks, at UN headquarters in New York.. The negotiations had been held up for years over disagreements on funding and fishing rights.. The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 - the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.. That agreement established an area called the high seas - international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research - but only 1.2% of these waters are protected. . Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.. In the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, . These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. . Environmental groups .  that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.. The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".. Rena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.. Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.. Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. . Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. . Dr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.. He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that's our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\". Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\". \"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.. Countries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. . Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\". ",

The tool was designed in 1869 and had changed little, the ministry said.. \"The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologised in Russia,\" the ministry said.. The continued use of the shovel \"as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterise much of the war\", it said.. One of the reservists described being \"neither physically nor psychologically\" prepared for the action, the update added.. \"Recent evidence suggests an increase in close combat in Ukraine,\" it said. . \"This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.\". The BBC has been unable to independently verify these reports. The ministry did not give information on where such battles were taking place.. Meanwhile Russian forces appear to have secured a sufficient positional advantage in the besieged city of Bakhmut, . Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take control of the small city, where around 4,000 civilians remain. . Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia, but the city's strategic value has been questioned.. The ISW said Russia's positional advantage could allow a \"turning movement\" in the city. . The purpose of a turning movement is to force the enemy to abandon prepared defensive positions, and is different from the aim of an encirclement, which is to trap and destroy enemy forces, the ISW says. . \"The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,\" the ISW said.. However, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday that it had no intention of withdrawing from Bakhmut.. A statement by the Armed Forces General Staff acknowledged that Russian forces were still trying to surround the city, but said more than 100 attacks had been repelled in the eastern Donbas region in the past 24 hours. . Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000.. ",

Police estimated 12,000 people attended the protest. . Some demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.. The protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading \"Down with killer governments\".. On the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track. . The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.. The train crash has been widely attributed to human error. . Earlier this week, a 59-year-old station master in Larissa was charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court. His lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident.. But many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. Union members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. Train drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.. The transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a \"sign of respect\" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.. Immediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.. ",
