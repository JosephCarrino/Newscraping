        "content": "She was also barred from activities as a journalist for five years.. Hundreds of civilians died when the Mariupol theatre was bombed last March.. Ponomarenko was detained last April, weeks after the bombing, for posting that Russian warplanes had carried out the attack even though the Russian defence ministry had denied it.. She is one of a growing number of Russian dissidents jailed for criticising the war in Ukraine.. Some 1,200 civilians were seeking shelter inside the theatre when it was bombed by Russian fighter jets. Ukrainian authorities believe 300 people were killed but an Associated Press investigation said the number was closer to 600. Many of the bodies were found in the basement.. Amnesty International said it was a war crime carried out by Russian forces and the international monitoring group .  that a Ukrainian battalion had blown up the theatre.. Prosecutors said Maria Ponomarenko had committed a criminal offence brought in within days of the invasion of spreading \"knowingly false information\" about the Russian armed forces.. Addressing the court ahead of her sentence she stressed that under Russia's constitution she had done nothing wrong: \"Had I committed a real crime then it would be possible to ask for leniency, but again, due to my moral and ethical qualities, I would not do this.\". Declaring herself a patriotic, opposition pacifist, she ended her address by saying: \"No totalitarian regime has ever been as strong as before its collapse.\". The journalist and activist, who has two young children, has suffered mental health problems in jail, according to her lawyer, and last year compared her conditions in pre-trial detention to torture.. Last summer, Moscow councillor Alexei Gorinov was jailed for seven years after he was filmed speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine in a city council meeting. Earlier this week a UN working group called for his release, concluding that his detention was arbitrary and contravened the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.. In December one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years for spreading \"fake news\" about the military after he went on YouTube to condemn the killing of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians by Russian occupying forces in Bucha, near Kyiv. .

        "content": "On Monday, there was a violent incident at the hospital in the opposition-held region where she was being treated.. A male nurse, accompanied by two armed men, allegedly beat the manager. . The head of the health directorate, Dr Ahmad Hajj Hassan, denied claims on social media that it was a foiled attempt to kidnap Aya.. \"The kidnap allegations were a misunderstanding. This was a wholly internal hospital-related issue and had no connection whatsoever with the baby,\" he told the BBC.. Thousands of people offered to adopt the baby last week, after her story was widely reported by local and international media.. However, the health directorate is determined to prioritise her welfare and act cautiously with the adoption process, according to the source. . Aya's mother went into labour soon after their family home in the town of Jindayris was destroyed by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck southern Turkey on 6 February.. She died after giving birth to Aya, who was still connected by her umbilical cord when she was found by rescuers.. Dramatic footage shared on social media showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris.. Aya's father, four siblings and an aunt were also killed in the disaster. . Khalil al-Suwadi, a distant relative who was there when she was pulled to safety, brought the baby to the hospital in Afrin.. . \"She had bumps, bruises, she was cold and barely breathing,\" he added.. She responded to treatment and by the next day her condition had stabilised.. The hospital's manager said his wife was breastfeeding Aya alongside their own four-month daughter and that they would care for her until she was adopted.. Jindaryis, about 8km (5 miles) from the Turkish border, was one of the worst-hit towns in Syria. Some 200 buildings there have completely collapsed.. The White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders have been leading the search and rescue effort in opposition-held areas, say 517 bodies have been pulled from the rubble there. . The deaths represent almost a quarter of the total reported by the White Helmets and opposition authorities across the region, where 90% of the 4.6 million population needed humanitarian assistance even before the disaster..
