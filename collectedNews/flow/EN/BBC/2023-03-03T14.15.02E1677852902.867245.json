Meanwhile, Russian mercenaries say they have \"practically encircled\" the key city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.. The comments were made by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who heads the paramilitary Wagner group.. In its latest news bulletin, Ukraine's military said Russian troops continued their offensive on Bakhmut - but the attacks were \"repelled\". .

The Institute for the Study of War .  that Russian forces were continuing \"limited ground attacks\" north-east of Kupiansk, as well as offensive operations around Kreminna, about 80km south-east.. Kupiansk - home to an important railway junction - has witnessed fierce fighting since the war began, with Russia taking control in a matter of days, and occupying the city for several months. . However, in September Ukrainian forces took back control amid a .  that saw almost entire of the Kharkiv region brought under Kyiv's control.. Those advances - and the liberation of the southern city of Kherson - were the most significant front-line changes since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. . Last month, Ukraine warned that Russia was preparing a major new offensive, with officials saying Moscow has amassed thousands of troops on Ukraine's eastern flank..

        "content": "Violators of the new drag law, meanwhile, face nearly a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 (£2,100). . Governor Bill Lee enacted the laws as questions were asked about an old photo apparently of him in women's clothing.. When it comes into force next month, the drag law will ban performances \"harmful to minors\" by \"go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators\" in public places or venues where they could be viewed by children.. The statute is the first of its type to be enacted in the US after a recent flurry of similar laws proposed in Republican-run states.. Governor Lee, a Republican, has rejected allegations he is being hypocritical by signing the law. . He has faced questions over a photo posted over the weekend on Reddit labelled \"Tennessee Governor Bill Lee in drag\", purportedly from a 1977 school yearbook photo. The person in the picture seems to be wearing a cheerleader's uniform, curly wig and a pearl necklace. . Mr Lee was asked about the photo earlier this week during a press conference. . \"What a ridiculous, ridiculous question that is,\" he responded, without confirming or denying the authenticity of the image. . \"Conflating something like that to sexualised entertainment in front of children, which is a very serious subject.\". His office later issued a statement: \"The bill specifically protects children from obscene, sexualised entertainment, and any attempt to conflate this serious issue with light-hearted school traditions is dishonest and disrespectful to Tennessee families.\". What exactly the law will prohibit is still unclear. . One of its sponsors, state legislator Chris Todd, previously called drag shows \"child abuse\" no matter what they contain, . . . But other Republicans say the law would not broadly affect drag shows that are legal under Tennessee's existing laws on obscenity.. Opponents of the law, including the state legislature's Democrats, argue that this new legislation is redundant because they say sexualised performances in front of children are already illegal under Tennessee law.. Bills to restrict drag events have been introduced in recent months in at least 14 different states, . , a free-speech organisation.. Drag performances at libraries, which usually involve reading storybooks to children, have been the target of protests by religious organisations, parents' groups, right-wing activists, and extremists including the Proud Boys. . Opponents say such shows aim to groom or sexualise young children. Performers and LGBT groups say the events are age-appropriate and educate children about being different. . LGBT groups say they are worried about the potential chilling effect of the law. Chris Sanders, of the Tennessee Equality Project, says drag show organisers in the state are considering cancelling or delaying performances until there is clarity around the legislation.. The law restricting medical treatment for transgender youth prohibits doctors from providing hormones or surgical treatment for minors, with a few limited exceptions. Children and teenagers under 18 who are already receiving such treatment can continue to receive it until April 2024.. Doctors who violate the law could be fined up to $25,000 (£21,000) per procedure. . House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Republican, said children are not mature enough to make \"life-altering\" decisions about such operations or medication.. \"These treatments and procedures have a lifetime of negative consequences that are irreversible,\" he said, . .. But the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organisation, said they would sue to stop the legislation from being enforced. . \"We are dedicated to overturning this unconstitutional law and are confident the state will find itself completely incapable of defending it in court,\" the organisations said in a statement. . Enforcement of similar laws in other states, including Alabama and Arkansas, has been paused by lawsuits.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Police held hostage in Colombia protest. Violence erupted on Thursday after residents blockaded the compound of the oil exploration company Emerald Energy.. They were demanding its help to repair and build new roads in the area.. A civilian was also killed and nine oilfield workers captured alongside the police officers. Video showed the hostages sitting in a crowded room on rows of chairs and on the floor. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he hoped they would be \"unilaterally\" released before any escalation of violence, and asked for medical help from the Red Cross.. Many of the protesters are rural and indigenous people who want Emerald Energy to build new road infrastructure around the San Vicente del Caguan area.. The oil company did not respond when approached by Reuters news agency for comment.. Colombian police paid tribute on Twitter to the police officer killed in the clash, who they named as Ricardo Monroy.. \"Today we are more united than ever,\" they wrote, adding that Mr Monroy had \"offered his life in the line of duty\".. Local government officials said the officer died from a machete attack, while the civilian was killed by gunfire.. Colombia's human rights ombudsman Carlos Camargo - who was on site to mediate - said he had spoken with protesters and stopped them from firing Molotov cocktails at the oil facility.. Protests in areas near energy and mining operations in Colombia are common as communities demand companies build infrastructure, including roads and schools.. Police said a dissident subgroup of Farc rebels which rejected the 2016 peace deal were present in the region and may have been provoking the unrest.. Separately, Mr Petro on Thursday unexpectedly published a statement on Twitter asking the country's prosecutor general to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption involving his own son and brother.. The statement did not specify the accusations against his eldest son, Nicolas Petro Burgos, and brother, Juan Fernando Petro Urrego, but it did say: \"my government will not give out benefits to criminals in exchange for bribes\". .
