The 24 passengers are said to include two children and there were also two crew members aboard the boat.. Waves in the area had been high and local fishing boats had apparently decided to return to port by mid-morning. . The crew reportedly said that all those on board were wearing life jackets. .

It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned by the Kremlin, but they were widely cited in Russian state media including the Interfax and Tass news agencies.. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were \"looking into\" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. . Meanwhile, a senior EU official told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. . Moldova has summoned Moscow's ambassador over the comments, which its foreign ministry described as \"deeply concerning\".. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. . A small detachment of around 1,500 Russian troops has been stationed in the region since 1995 as part of a truce agreement. . Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region on Friday. . \"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,\" Gen Minnekayev said. . Mr Putin made similar claims, without providing evidence, about alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine before launching the invasion on 24 February. . Ukraine's defence ministry denounced Gen Minnekayev's comments as Russian \"imperialism\". . And the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to them in his regular overnight address. \"The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries,\" he claimed.. He earlier said Russia was planning on holding a series of sham independence referendums in occupied regions to create a series of pro-Russian breakaway states. . \"If they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know this is not to help you,\" he warned.. \"This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. This is the reality. Be careful.\". A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defence ministry said that referendums were planned in Kherson and occupied areas around Zaporizhzhia in the coming weeks. .

        "content": "Women and children in a crowded room can be heard saying they are running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated from the southern city.. Some say they have seen no daylight for weeks, having been there from February.. The BBC has not verified the video, believed to be filmed on 21 April.. On the same day, President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks, and ordered his troops to seal it off instead. . Moscow also declared itself to be in full control of the strategic city - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says Russian troops were simply unable to seize the Azovstal steelworks.. The plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is a huge industrial site in central Mariupol. . Taking the Sea of Azov port - which has been almost erased by weeks of heavy Russian bombardment - is a key Kremlin war aim, and would release more troops to join an ongoing Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. The footage was posted online on 23 April. . The Azov regiment, which was originally a far-right group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard, says it shows its fighters delivering food and other aid to women and children in one of the Azovstal underground bunkers.. Big signs reading \"Children\" in red paint are seen on the walls leading to the room. One woman, who is not named, is heard saying more than 15 children - from babies to those aged 14 - are sheltering there.. Another unnamed woman is seen on camera telling how she has been sheltering since 25 February - the second day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. One of the children, a girl, says she left her house together with her mother and grandmother on 27 February. . \"We haven't seen the sky or the sun since. We want to get out of here very much. We want it to be safe for us, so no-one is hurt, and then live in safety.\". The girl says she wants to be able to go to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where one of her brothers has managed to escape to from Kharkiv - a heavily-bombed city in the north-east.. \"I want to get out… to be in safety. I don't want to risk getting out only to be hit by bomb fragments, for example,\" she adds.. Weaving deep through what the battalion say is the Azovstal steelwork tunnels, the video shows an underground rabbit warren, filled with families and young children. . It is difficult to verify the video, but if accurate it is a rare glimpse of life in the Azovstal plant and a final push by the Azov regiment to ensure that the situation in Mariupol is at the forefront of global attention as the Russian army seal it off. . The Russian media have portrayed their brutal campaign in Mariupol as a way to \"de-Nazify and demilitarise\" Ukraine. This video has been released to replace that image with one of fear and desperation in the eyes of children who say they've not seen the sun in one-and-a-half months, asking to be evacuated. This video is an attempt to control the narrative about what is happening on the ground. . The Azov regiment is controversial; it was originally a far-right group. This video shows them as approachable warriors, fist-bumping children and bringing them supplies, while other images on social media show Russian soldiers standing outside burning buildings and Russian tanks rolling through the city.. Earlier this week, one of the commanders of Azov told the BBC that many civilians, including children, were sheltering at the site. He also said dead Ukrainian fighters were there.. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula, to fight against Russian forces and pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Donbas region. . Some of Azov fighters originally had links to nationalist and far-right groups. The regiment was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. . The regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in Mariupol.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round.. But these are two polarising figures in France, and no votes are guaranteed.. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having close ties to Russia's president.. Mr Macron came to power on a whirlwind promise of change but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now rising prices.. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017.. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last.  . The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout could be historically low.. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration. . Polls open at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) with voting set to end some 12 hours later. . Whatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.. The rising cost of living - described in France as .  or spending power - has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins.. She has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era.. She came top two weeks ago in La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, Cécile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: \"Before Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm.\". She will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: \"People can't afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I'm in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat.\" African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds.. There are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that. . She has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a \"Europe of nations\" would tear the EU apart.  . Jean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and take drugs.. This video can not be played. Across France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La Ferté too.. Apprentice accountant Séréna, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: \"We don't really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now.\". Nicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. \"I'm not so worried about her, more about the people behind her - her lieutenants.\". Ms Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.. He was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes. . The town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a Mélenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply.. Outside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right's policies as racist. \"I'm going to vote blank,\" she says. It's a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all.. Many Mélenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. \"Macron is more for the rich than the poor,\" he says, before adding that he could still vote for him.. Unemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and  abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires.. When Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all. . If the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.. Epic tracks from the 90s and a special guest appearance by Chesney Hawkes!.
