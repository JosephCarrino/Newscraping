        "content": "Speaking to US media, Ben Crump urged President Joe Biden to use Mr Nichols's death to gain support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.. And he said Mr Nichols's mother was coping with her son's loss by hoping that his death could lead to change.. \"She believes in her heart Tyre was sent here for an assignment and that there is going to be greater good that comes from this tragedy,\" Mr Crump said. . The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was introduced in 2021 after Mr Floyd was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. His death sparked international protests.. The bill would see a federal ban on the use of chokeholds by police and make it easier to bring charges against offending officers. . Lawmakers in the House of Representatives - which was then controlled by the Democratic Party - passed the bill in March 2021, but it was later held up by opposition in the Senate. . \"Shame on us if we don't use his tragic death to finally get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,\" Mr Crump told CNN. The lawyer said if the law did not change, deaths at the hands of police would continue. . Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP civil rights group - also called on legislators to take action. . \"By failing to write a piece of legislation, you're writing another obituary,\" Mr Johnson said in a statement. \"We can name all the victims of police violence, but we can't name a single law you have passed to address it.\". But the Republican House of Representatives Judiciary chair Jim Jordan warned politicians to not rush legislation. . \"These five individuals did not have any respect for life... I don't know if there's anything you can do to stop the kind of evil we saw in that video,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press programme. . A childhood friend of Mr Nichols told the BBC his legacy would be preserved through legal reform. Angelina Paxton said he \"always wanted to change the world\".  . Ms Paxton said Mr Nichols was \"very passionate about Black Lives Matter\".. \"He always wanted to make a difference,\" she said. \"If it gives anyone any comfort out of all those pain that we're all going through right now, just know that I can guarantee you he's up there right now smiling, because he finally did what he always wanted to do.\" . On Saturday, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the so-called Scorpion special unit of which the police officers now charged with murder were members. . The unit was a 50-person team that was tasked with bringing down crime levels - particularly car thefts and gang-related offences. . Scorpion stood for \"Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\".. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired from the Memphis police force last week.. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.. In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be \"more responsive\" and \"more proactive\" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols \"decided to go off the rails\".  . \"We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,\" she said. \"This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.\"  . Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who \"appeared on the scene following\" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation.. This video can not be played. Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols. ",

        "content": "One drone was destroyed by air defence systems and two were caught by \"defence traps\", causing minor damage to a building, the ministry added.. The extent of damage to the site has not been confirmed by the BBC, and there has been no immediate claim of responsibility.. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran's foreign minister, said the \"cowardly\" incident was an attempt to destabilise the country.. But he added that the incident would not impact Iran's \"determination and intention regarding the peaceful nuclear progress\".. Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Patrick Ryder said the US military played no part in the strikes, but declined to speculate further, the Reuters news agency reported.. The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Iran's nuclear programme and its supply of arms to Russia's war in Ukraine.. The country has also been wracked by internal turmoil in recent months, spurred by the death of a woman who was detained for violating Iran's strict dress code.. In a statement to Iranian state media, the defence ministry said the drone strike happened on Saturday night at around 23:30 local time (20:00 GMT).. Local authorities did not comment on activities at the site, but called it a \"workshop\". The IRNA news agency said the strike had targeted \"an ammunition manufacturing plant\".. Isfahan province is home to a large air base and several nuclear sites, including Natanz, which is at the centre of Iran's uranium enrichment programme. . In a separate incident on Saturday, the IRNA new agency reported a fire broke out at an oil facility near the north-western city of Tabriz. No details about the cause have been revealed.. In recent years, there have been a number of explosions, fires and cyber attacks on Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities.. After Iran accused Israel of sabotaging the key nuclear facility near the city of Natanz in 2021, Israel's defence chief said the country's operations in the region \"are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy\".. And in 2020 Iran alleged that Israel was behind the assassination one of its top nuclear scientists, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. . ",

        "content": "But Ukraine has asked allied nations to create a \"fighter jet coalition\" to bolster their capabilities. . The US said it would discuss the idea of supplying jets \"very carefully\" with Kyiv on Thursday. . In an interview with Tagesspiegel, Mr Scholz said his focus was on the delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks.. \"The fact we've only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and the next debate is firing up in Germany, that just seems frivolous\", he said. . On Wednesday Germany committed to supplying 14 of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, after weeks of pressure from allies.. Following Germany's commitment to send the tanks, the US said it would provide Ukraine with its M1 Abrams tanks. . Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, Andrii Melnyk, has called for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would provide Ukraine with US F-16s and F-35s, Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Ukraine's Freedom Television Network they also needed missiles \"to drastically reduce the Russian army's key weapon\".. And Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky echoed that in a daily video address where he said the country needed the US-made ATACMS missile, which has a range of 185 miles (297km). . He said the missiles would help Ukraine anticipate Russian attacks on urban areas and civilians. . Washington has so far refused to provide that weapon. . In the Tagesspiegel interview, Mr Scholz reiterated that Nato was not at war with Russia, \"we will not allow such an escalation,\" he said. . He confirmed that he speaks regularly to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, with the most recent call between the two in December 2022. . \"We need to talk to each other,\" he said, but added that he was always clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was absolutely unacceptable and only the withdrawal of its troops would resolve the situation. .

        "content": "\"If you absolutely want to join Nato, you will return these terrorists to us,\" said Mr Erdogan.. His comments come days after Turkey suspended talks to accept the two Nordic nations as members.. The move was prompted by a series of controversial protests in Stockholm, including one during which a copy of the Koran was burned.. Swedish officials have condemned the protests, but defended the country's free speech laws.. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland applied to join Nato last year, ending decades of military non-alignment.. Their application must be unanimously approved by all current Nato members, but Turkey and Hungary have failed to ratify their bids.. In his speech, Mr Erdogan suggested Turkey might now \"give a different response concerning Finland,\" adding that \"Sweden will be shocked\".. \"We gave Sweden a list of 120 persons and told them to extradite those terrorists in their country,\" said Mr Erdogan. \"If you don't extradite them, then sorry about that.\". Sweden has a larger Kurdish diaspora than Finland, and its talks with Ankara over Nato membership have been heated.. Turkey has called on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU.. In response, Sweden approved a constitutional amendment which allows it to create tougher anti-terror laws demanded by Turkey.. Both Sweden and Finland have also lifted bans on the sale of military equipment to Turkey, introduced after Ankara's military intervention in Syria in 2019.. But Turkey has heavily criticised Sweden over recent protests in Stockholm, . Earlier this month, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May.. Helsinki's Foreign Minister, Pekka Haavisto, has since .  and that negotiations should be paused.. The diplomat also stressed his country should join at the same time as Sweden - appearing to backtrack on his earlier suggestion that Finland could be forced to join without its Nordic neighbour.. ",
