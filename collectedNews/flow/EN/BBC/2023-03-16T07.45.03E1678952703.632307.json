        "content": "Ukraine's forces are outgunned and outnumbered, but on a chalk hillside to the south, there is the anti-tank group from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. 3Storm - as they are known - are unyielding. They've dug trenches deep into the earth. Timber props supporting the roof shudder as Russian artillery lands in the near distance, and field mice scurry along duck boards. An antiquated field telephone sits in a wooden nook; these are conditions their grandfathers would recognise. . \"They cannot get to us, we can see for a kilometre in all directions,\" says a bearded 26-year-old soldier who goes by the call sign \"Dwarf\", pointing out Russian positions. \"We can hit the enemy with everything we have,\" he says.. Neither the Russian nor Ukrainian armies release official casualty figures for Bakhmut, or elsewhere, but the mostly abandoned city has become a slaughter house.. In a week fighting for the city, Dwarf's company faced conscripted prisoners from Russia's Wagner group. \"We had battles every two hours,\" he says. \"I guess a single company eliminated 50 people per day.\" In case of any doubt, he points out these numbers were confirmed by aerial reconnaissance. \"The [Russian vehicle] arrives, 50 bodies come out, a day passes, 50 bodies come out again,\" he says. His company lost a fraction of that number, he says. . Officially, Ukraine estimates that for every one of its soldiers killed, Russia loses seven. Earlier this week, Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members in a 24-hour period in the battle for Bakhmut. None of these numbers can be independently verified. . In a newspaper interview, two captured Wagner conscripts told the Wall Street Journal that before they are sent forward, they receive little training beyond learning to crawl through forests in the dark. After six months serving at the front they are freed - assuming they survive.. This video can not be played. Quentin Somerville approaches the frontline in Bakhmut. Conditions all along the 600-mile-long eastern front have begun to change. 3Storm's chalky hilltop hideout feels like dry land compared with the surrounding territory. An early spring has turned the hard ground of winter to mud porridge - which may favour the defenders. To get there, we had to follow the Ukrainian soldiers on foot - within a few paces my boots become lumpen and heavy with thick dirt. A battlefield ambulance speeds by unsteadily, its caterpillar tracks ploughing up the ground, and spraying pools of sludge as it struggles for grip. . The villages around here - the location can't be revealed - are in ruin. Handwritten signs on gates, mostly in Russian, announce \"People Live Here\", a plea as much as it is a statement. But the streets are entirely empty, apart from abandoned dogs who roam the ruins of destroyed farms and homes. . For the past two months, Russian forces have steadily advanced, trying to encircle Bakhmut. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, says his forces will continue to resist. \"Every day of steadfast resistance wins us valuable time to reduce the enemy's offensive capabilities,\" he says, sending more reinforcements to the area. But it isn't only Russians who have fallen into the Bakhmut trap. Ukrainians are dying there, too, in ever increasing numbers. . On the hillside, a group of soldiers have gathered around a gun position, and I ask Dwarf - given that Ukraine is losing soldiers to untrained Russian convicts - if the defence of dead city, surrounded by the enemy, makes sense. . He says, \"I was wondering, myself, if we should keep defending Bakhmut. On the one hand what's happening here now is awful. There are no words to describe it. But the alternative is we give up Bakhmut and move to another settlement. What's the difference between defending Bakhmut or any other village?\". His comrade, a strongly built man with a full dark beard who goes by the call sign Holm, agrees. \"It's not a strategic question for us here. We are ordinary soldiers. But this is our land. We may then retreat to Chasiv Yar, from Chasiv Yar to Slovyansk, and so we retreat up to Kyiv. Let it take a year or two, four, five - but we have to fight for every piece of our land.\". The men have been fighting for more than a year now, and they say the Russians are evolving. . \"They are learning, they are getting cleverer, and it really freaks me out,\" says Dwarf. \"They send out a group - five morons taken from prison. They are shot, but the enemy sees where you are, walks around, and you are surrounded from behind.\". Holm chimes in that Russia is now using drones armed with grenades more effectively. \"We used to drop them and freak them out,\" he says. \"Now they're dropping drone grenades on our positions.\". Before the war, Dwarf was an outdoor youth worker and would take youngsters hiking in the Carpathian Mountains on the country's western edge. Here on Ukraine's eastern front, that is a far-off memory. He's been in many battles since then, but the horror of Bakhmut is what lives with him now. . When I ask about Wagner's convict army, he pauses to think and says, \"I'll be honest. It's genius. Cruel, immoral, but effective tactics. It worked out. And it's still working in Bakhmut.\". Days later, I'm back in the same area, crammed with four others into a Soviet-era UAZ jeep. Its steering wheel has the BMW logo - a joke says the driver, Oleg. He says little else as he grips the wheel and concentrates hard as the car whines and struggles over hills and through the shoals of muck. The automatic gunfire ahead signals we are nearing the 28th Mechanised Brigade, who are directly facing the Russians. . The landscape of war shifts in an instant - the men are holed up in a small wood, its trees shattered and split by Russian fire. In a month, the wood will offer them cover. For now, its bare branches expose them to surveillance drones. Nearby there's an exchange of gunfire, and Russian shells strike around 500m away. But Borys, a 48-year-old former architect who is serving now as a captain, seems untroubled. . \"Today's war is a drone war,\" he says, \"but we can walk around freely, because there's wind and rain today and drones are blown away. If it was quiet today, both our drones and our enemy's would be hovering over us.\" . On the way back, Oleg brings the jeep to a sudden halt. Lying in the dirt in front of us is a drone that has been blown off course. Its battery is quickly removed and it is brought inside - it turns out to be Ukrainian.. But today's war isn't so very different from the past. . Two nights before, the 28th Brigade was attacked by Russian infantry and tanks. In a timbered gun position below ground, the cold, rain drips through the roof onto the dirt floor, and there, peering out into the bare landscape, is a Maxim belt-fed machine gun with stout iron wheels.. \"It only works when there is a massive attack going onâ€¦then it really works,\" says Borys. \"So we use it every week\". . And this is how the battle for Bakhmut is being fought, as winter turns to spring in 21st Century Europe. A 19th Century weapon still mows down men by the score in the black Ukrainian earth.. ",

        "content": "A request for a change in ownership, first reported in the . , was confirmed to BBC News by TikTok.. The company said a forced sale would not change its data flows or access.. The White House has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment.. For years American officials have raised concerns that data from the popular app could fall into the hands of the Chinese government.. According to the WSJ, US President Joe Biden's administration wants ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok to create a clear break from China. . The newspaper said the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), which oversees national security risks, unanimously recommended ByteDance divest from TikTok.. A spokesperson for TikTok said it did not dispute the WSJ's reporting and confirmed it had been contacted by CFIUS. . However, the spokesperson said the reporting was overstated and it was not clear what \"divestiture\" meant in practice. . \"If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.\" the spokesperson said. . \"The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems\".. A ban was first threatened under then-President Donald Trump in 2020. . However, Mr Biden's administration has also taken a dim view of the social network.. TikTok hoovers up huge amounts of data on its users, similar to Instagram and Twitter. . It can take biometric data from users and has access to location data. The fear is the information could be passed to the Chinese government. . TikTok says it has undertaken an effort to move all US-based data to the US as part of an initiative it calls Project Texas.. The company has told BBC News it still plans to move forward with that plan.. The development comes a week after new legislation was announced that would expand the president's authority to ban TikTok nationwide was unveiled in the senate. . The Restrict Act would allow the US Commerce Department to declare foreign-linked companies national security risks. . TikTok is banned on government phones in the US, Canada and the EU. . Its chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, is set to testify before the US Congress next week in a widely anticipated showdown.. ",

        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large MQ-9 Reaper drone . The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.. Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.. \"I don't know whether we'll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done,\" Mr Patrushev said.. He also said that the drone's presence in the Black Sea was \"confirmation\" that the US was directly involved in the war.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.. He said it would be challenging to retrieve the drone, noting the water where it crashed was anywhere between 4,000ft to 5,000ft (1,200m to 1,500m) deep.. US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. In a statement, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. The US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, confirmed he had spoken with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, the day after the drone was downed.. In a statement released after the phonecall, Russia's defence ministry said Mr Shoigu blamed the incident on \"increased reconnaissance activities against the interests of the Russian Federation\". It also called US drone flights off the coast of Crimea \"provocative\".. The US and UK have previously gone to extraordinary lengths to recover their technology after crashes.. They retrieved the wreckage of their stealth fighter jet, the F-35 from the bottom of the South China Sea after it sank.. But on the face of it, the Pentagon seems more relaxed about losing a Reaper drone. It's older technology and numerous have been lost before. . And trying to recover a downed drone in deep waters, next to a war zone, with Russian ships and submarines patrolling, could present even greater risks of escalation. . Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The lost Reaper may have been carrying a surveillance pod able to suck up electronic data such as radar emissions. . The US Department of Defense said.  that the surveillance trips are used to gather information which helps improve security for Europe and supports \"allied partners\". . The US has reportedly shared intelligence with Ukraine previously, . Ukraine's foreign minister told BBC reporter James Landale that incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Dmytro Kuleba said: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place.\" . Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",
