        "content": "The damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.. The key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . US military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. He said the jets were able to land following the incident.. This video can not be played. Watch: Pentagon calls Russia's move 'unsafe, unprofessional'. Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. . Brig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.. The United States' National Security Council's John Kirby told CNN: \"Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we've taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\". Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\" and that it was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.. Prof Michael Clarke, visiting professor in war studies at King's College, told the BBC the collision was \"almost certainly an accident\".. The ex-director general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute said: \"I don't believe any pilot could deliberately do that [only colliding with another aircraft's propeller] without seriously endangering their aircraft and own life.\". The incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.. To protest against the move, the US summoned Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov in Washington.. Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Mr Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\" and that \"the unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern\". . Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . This means the downing of the drone could conceivably have been the result of a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. . But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then analysts say that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "Argentina has been in economic difficulty for years, and most of the population now live in poverty.. Its government has being trying to stem price rises by capping the prices of food and other products. . But the food and drink sectors saw the most dramatic increase recent, with prices growing by 9.8% in February compared to January.. Argentinian media said that this increase could partly be due to a sharp hike in the price of meat, which rose by almost 20% in the space of a month. Adverse weather conditions, a prolonged heatwave and a drought seriously impacted livestock and crops, said local news outlet Ambito.. Although the symbolism of the inflation rate shooting up past 100% is striking, the effects of soaring inflation have long been felt in Argentina. . Last September, protesters took to the streets to demand action to counter rising costs of living, and, in February, Argentina's central bank said that.  in response to the jump in consumer prices.. The Argentinian government has long tried to contain inflation, but divisions have marred the country's economic policy. . Last summer, three economy ministers succeeded one another in the space of four weeks as the country's economic crisis deepened, and President Alberto Fernández is said to be at odds with his deputy, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, over how to tackle Argentina's economic problems. . In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. ",

        "content": "The United States' National Security Council's (NSC) John Kirby says there have been other intercepts \"even in recent weeks\", but that this one was different.. Could it have been an accident? . \"Based on the actions of the Russian pilots, it's clear that it was unsafe, unprofessional,\" was the verdict of the Pentagon's Press Secretary, Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. . \"I think the actions speak for themselves.\". Does the behaviour of Russia's pilots - allegedly dumping fuel in the path of the drone and then colliding with it - represent a significant escalation? . This video can not be played. Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?. According to the Pentagon, the whole incident lasted about 30-40 minutes.. During that time, Gen Ryder said there was no direct communication between the Russian and American militaries. . US officials say they believe the Russian Su-27 jets involved \"likely\" suffered some damage, indicating that a collision was not deliberate.. \"I do know that the state department is raising our concerns about the incident directly with the Russian government,\" he added.. What, if anything, does the episode mean for the future of American drone operations over the Black Sea, and for the vital surveillance such operations provide to Ukraine? . \"If the message is that they want to deter or dissuade us from flying or operating in international airspace over the Black Sea,\" Mr Kirby told broadcaster VOA, \"then that message will fail because that is not going to happen\".. Not surprisingly, Russia would like to make it as hard as possible for Ukraine's allies to carry out such work. . Washington is being tight lipped about what has happened to the drone. . After the collision, US remote pilots were forced to bring it down in the Black Sea.. Gen Ryder would not say where it landed or whether the Russian navy was trying to recover it. . Audio recordings circulating on social media seem to indicate some kind of Russian recovery operation was under way. But this has not been confirmed. . Clearly, Washington would not be happy if such sensitive surveillance technology fell into Russian hands.. For Joe Biden, determined to support Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\", this is a delicate moment.. It's not just Western weaponry that's helping Ukraine to withstand Russia's invasion. . It's also a vast quantity of real-time intelligence on every aspect of Russia's military operations, including the movement of vessels in the Black Sea and the launch of missiles aimed at targets across Ukraine. . From defending Ukraine's critical national infrastructure to planning its own offensive operations, Kyiv depends heavily on the steady flow of information. . For obvious reasons, US officials won't be drawn into what, if any, additional precautions its surveillance operations will now involve.. Washington wants to keep them going, but is anxious to avoid using force, and risk getting drawn into a more direct confrontation with Moscow. . ",

        "content": "He is understood to have spent 22 consecutive days in isolation.. Queensland's human rights chief says the case may have broken state laws. . Jack was being held on remand on charges relating to a fight with another 13-year-old boy, at the detention centre some 1,300km north of Brisbane.. He flooded his cell with water from the toilet in desperation at his situation, and after being denied drinking water, his barrister Tim Grau told the BBC.. Describing his detention as \"extraordinary and cruel\", Mr Grau said Jack had \"no serious criminal history\".. \"He was 13, he'd been in court once before. So even for this offending, he was never going to get a period of incarceration, in my view,\" he said.. Mr Grau said he didn't know why Jack spent so long in isolation, but suspected it was due to staff shortages at the prison. . \"If he's being locked in because there's staff shortages, and Cleveland detention centre has 80 or more kids in at any one time, one can only assume that other kids are in the same circumstance. . \"You would hope not, but maybe it's more common than we thought.\". Jack's period of detention included six days being held in adult prisons. He was released last week with a verbal reprimand.. A separate recent case also raised human rights concerns over the Queensland's youth justice system, which is currently undergoing reform. . In February, it emerged that another 13-year-old Queensland boy with developmental disabilities spent 78 days confined to a cell for 20 hours per day.. Queensland is currently debating new laws which would criminalise bail breaches by minors - a change which will cause the youth prison population to increase dramatically, experts warn.. State Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said the recent cases may have breached Queensland's Human Rights Act, which states all prisoners should have access to fresh air and exercise for a minimum of two hours a day.. He warned that changes to the law would only make the situation worse, and that immediate steps were needed to stop children being placed in isolation. . \"Unfortunately, I don't think they're isolated cases,\" he told the BBC. . \"Given the laws that are [being] passed in Queensland, which are clearly intended to incarcerate more children, it becomes even more important that the government urgently develops a coherent plan for preventing children coming within the criminal justice system, \" he said.. \"My concern is by increasing the pressure on the system, we risk normalising the mistreatment of children\".. Mr McDougall urged the state government to \"double down\" on measures to keep children in school and stop them going down \"the path of criminalisation\".. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were 12 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous Australians in 2021, the Queensland Statisticians Office says. . Rates of juvenile incarceration are also high, with Indigenous children accounting for some 70% of detainees across most of Queensland, and over 90% in the state's north. . Overcrowded facilities mean children and minors often have to be housed in adult prisons known as watch houses. Most juvenile detainees are being held on remand. . In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs said solitary confinement or \"separations\" were only used as a last resort. . Youth detention centres were \"complex and difficult environments, and practices used in the centres are designed to ensure the safety of staff and young people at all times,\" the spokesperson said.. \"At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities.\".
