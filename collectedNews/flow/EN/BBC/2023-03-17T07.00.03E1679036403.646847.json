        "content": "Describing himself as \"pretty cooked\", Johnston told reporters he would keep going as \"I still have a job to do\". . His board-riding marathon has raised some $A240,000 (£132,000) for charity.. With spotlights to illuminate a section of Cronulla's surf known as \"The Alley\", Johnston kept going overnight and by Friday lunchtime had ridden over 600 waves. . The 40-year-old former pro surfer and distance runner faces the risk of blindness, infected ears and dehydration, as well as sleep deprivation, hypothermia, shark attack and jellyfish stings.. He emerged briefly from the sea at lunchtime on Friday for a medical check-up, and to receive eye-drops.. \"I surfed at two in the morning with him, and the lights actually went out so it was pitch black,\" his brother Ben told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. . \"There were a whole bunch of jellyfish out there, so it was interesting to say the least.\". Speaking ahead of his challenge, Johnston said: \"I thought, I could just do it. I can run for 40 hours,\". \"But, this way, I can surf with people, bring in the community and make a difference for the future.\". Johnston is fundraising for the Chumpy Pullin Foundation, set up in the memory of Australian Olympic snowboarder Alex 'Chumpy' Pullin who drowned off the Gold Coast while spearfishing in 2020. . He is also supporting mental health charities, partly in tribute to his father who took his own life a decade ago.. ",

        "content": "The attacks are thought to have been sparked by conditions in jails holding gang members.. Brazil's government sent hundreds of federal security forces to the region earlier this week. . Justice and Security Minister Flavio Dino said hundreds more could be sent in the coming days as unrest continues. The state government has convened a crisis cabinet and has asked the federal government for more support. . The attacks were ordered from within the state's jails when gang members' requests for televisions, electricity and conjugal visits were turned down, Brazilian news outlet Terra quoted the state's secretary of public security Francisco Araujo as saying.. Conditions in Brazil's notoriously overcrowded jails have . . . In 2017, the government sent a Penitentiary Intervention Task Force (FTIP) to Rio Grande do Norte jails following a riot which left at least 30 inmates dead. Some have said the task force routinely uses violent methods to bring prisons under its control.. Local media have reported that two rival gang factions have now struck a temporary truce and become allies in the attacks against security forces.. Several cities in Rio Grande do Norte have suspended public transport and closed schools in the wake of the violence. . At least two people were killed in clashes with police earlier in the week and 67 people have been arrested, reported AFP. . Across the region, police have also seized a number of firearms, explosive devices and vehicles, as well as drugs and money.. ",

        "content": "Authorities interpreted the books - about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village - as referring to Hong Kongers and China's government.. The arrests are another deterioration of Hong Konger's rights, critics say.. Human Rights Watch described the arrests as \"shameful\", and said the territory was using its colonial-era sedition law to clamp down on dissent.. Hong Kong media reported police arrested the men, aged 38 and 50, at their apartments on 13 March. They raided their homes in Kowloon and Hong Kong island and seized multiple copies of the books, which are part of a series titled Yangcun.. Both men have been released on bail but must report to the police next month, authorities said.. Officials also confirmed the books were the same that had been the subject of a high-profile trial last year - where a court had to determine if the Yangcun books advocated for rebellion against the state. The court ruled the picture books had \"seditious intention\" and j.  for publishing the books.. The group, aged between 25 and 28, had produced cartoon e-books that some interpreted as trying to explain Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement to children.. In one of the three books, a village of sheep fight back against a group of wolves who are trying to take over their settlement.. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. Under its \"one country, two systems\" principle, residents are supposed to enjoy certain freedoms unavailable on the mainland.. But these rights have been eroded since Beijing in 2020 imposed a national security law in response to the months-long Hong Kong protests against Beijing's control in 2019.. Beijing said the law was needed to bring stability to the city - but critics said it was designed to squash dissent, and weaken Hong Kong's autonomy.. In January, police arrested a 24-year-old student for sedition after he posted a download link of the Yangcun series on Facebook - accompanied by alleged inflammatory statements, local outlet Mingpao reported..

        "content": "Watch: Uproar on the streets of Paris and jeers in parliament over retirement age increase. Crowds converged on Place de la Concorde in response to raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.. The plans had sparked two months of heated political debate and strikes.. Finally, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne invoked article 49:3 of the constitution - allowing the government to avoid a vote in the Assembly.. The decision was taken minutes before MPs were scheduled to vote on the controversial bill, because there was no guarantee of winning a majority.. The move caused fury among opposition politicians. Many jeered the prime minister, sang La Marseillaise and held up signs of protest in parliament.. A no-confidence motion will be filed against President Emmanuel Macron's government, far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen has suggested.. Leader of left-wing party La France Insoumise (LFI), Mathilde Panot, tweeted that Mr Macron had plunged the country into a government crisis, without parliamentary or popular legitimacy.. Thousands of people came out on the streets of Paris and other French cities to reject the move, singing the national anthem and waving trade union flags. . Some protesters clashed with police as evening fell. A fire was lit in the middle of the Place de la Concorde and police with shields and batons fired tear gas and moved to clear the square. . By nightfall, 120 people had been arrested, Paris police told AFP news agency.. But unions vowed to maintain their opposition to the pension changes, with the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) saying another day of strikes and demonstrations was being planned for Thursday 23 March.. The constitutional procedure that has prompted all this anger may sound obscure, but it is very much part of the political vocabulary in France. . Even though Mr Macron was re-elected last year on a platform of retirement reforms, his ruling coalition has no majority in the Assembly and would have needed support from the Republicans party to pass the pension changes.. Officials from Mr Macron's Renaissance party spent the morning desperately whipping members into line in a bid to pass their bill.. They knew some of their MPs could vote against or abstain, faced with the evident unpopularity of the bill, so they resorted to special constitutional powers.. But whenever a government invokes the 49:3, it can be sure it will be accused straight away of riding roughshod over the will of the people.. In fact, it has been used precisely 100 times in the more than 60 years of the Fifth Republic, and by governments of all shades.   . Obviously, it tends to be used more frequently by governments that do not have an in-built majority in parliament, such as the socialist Michel Rocard's in the 1980s and Élisabeth Borne's today.  . She has in fact already used it several times, but those occasions were for public finance bills which were less controversial.. Use of the procedure is a way to bypass a vote which might be lost, but the down side for the government is that the opposition parties can immediately table a vote of no-confidence. . If these are voted through, the government falls. That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.. The dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.. But the bill is regularly described by opponents as \"brutal\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\".. Morale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away. . This video can not be played. WATCH: French MPs boo PM and sing national anthem over pension reforms. ",

        "content": "The Commission's report is categorical that Russia also committed other war crimes in Ukraine. . They include attacks on hospitals, torture, rape and wilful killings.. Ukraine government figures put the number of children forcibly taken to Russia at 16,221.. Russia has introduced policies such as the granting of Russian citizenship and the placement of children in foster families to \"create a framework in which some of the children may end up remaining permanently\" in Russia, the report notes.. While the transfers were supposed to be temporary \"most became prolonged\", with both parents and children facing \"an array of obstacles in establishing contact\", UN investigators wrote. . In some cases, parents or children told the Commission that once in Russia-controlled areas, transferred children were made to wear \"dirty clothes, were screamed at, and called names.\" They also said that \"some children with disabilities did not receive adequate care and medication.\". The burden of contacting their parents fell primarily to the transferred children as the adults faced \"considerable logistical, financial, and security challenges\" in finding or retrieving their children, the report says.. It also quotes witnesses as saying that the smaller children transferred may have not been able to establish contact with their families and might, as a consequence, \"lose contact with them indefinitely\".. The forced deportations of Ukrainian children \"violate international humanitarian law, and amount to a war crime\", concludes the report.. The UN said that said that in addition to the rapes, killings and \"widespread\" torture, Moscow could be responsible for the even more serious \"crimes against humanity\" - notably the wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure that began last October. . The commission is also trying to determine whether the bombing and siege of the city of Mariupol last May might constitute a crime against humanity.. The investigators said they had also documented \"a small number\" of violations committed by Ukrainian armed forces.. ",
