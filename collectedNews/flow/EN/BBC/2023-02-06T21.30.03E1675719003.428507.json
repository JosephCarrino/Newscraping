        "content": "A job offer to Mr Myers was later rescinded, and Mr Santos told news outlet Semafor he was concerned by wiretapping charges faced by the aide during previous work as a journalist.. The accusations are the latest in a series of controversies for Mr Santos.Â . The BBC has reached out to the congressman's office for comment.. On Twitter on Friday, Mr Myers said he had filed a complaint to the Capitol police and wrote a letter to the House ethics committee, which can investigate violations of House rules, related to incidents he claims took place during his brief time working in Mr Santos's office. . The letter, which he posted online, details his allegations against Mr Santos. He said he was offered a job late last month in the Long Island congressman's office as his staff assistant. . The 34-year-old has faced growing calls to resign after he admitted fabricating parts of his resume and biography since his election in New York last year.. He is also facing multiple investigations over his campaign spending and financial reports. He has previously denied wrongdoing.. According to Mr Myers, on 25 January, Mr Santos asked him if he had a profile on Grindr, a popular LGBT dating app. Mr Santos then allegedly informed him that he had a profile on Grindr, Mr Myers said.. On a separate occasion the same day, Mr Myers was alone with Mr Santos in the congressman's office sorting mail.. \"He called me 'buddy' and insisted I sit next to him on the sofa,\" Mr Myers wrote. \"I proceeded to move forward with a discussion about the mail, but the congressman stopped me by placing his hand on my left leg, near my knee.\" . Mr Myers claimed the congressman then invited him to karaoke, which he declined, and proceeded to \"take his hand and move it down my leg into my inner-thigh\", where he \"touched\" his groin.. Next, Mr Myers said Mr Santos told him that his husband was away for the night and invited him to come over.. \"I quickly pushed the congressman's hand away and grabbed the mail from the table and proceeded to discuss the topic of constituent correspondence,\" Mr Myers wrote. . Mr Myers was working under the status of \"volunteer\" at the time of the incident, he said, something he told was necessary as he waited for his new-hire paperwork to process through the payroll department. This was something he said he later learned was against House rules. . On Monday, 30 January, Mr Myers said he was called into Mr Santos' office and asked about his background as a journalist, matters that Mr Myers said had already been discussed prior to receiving a job offer. . Last year, he was charged with wiretapping while working as a journalist in Ohio after publishing audio of court testimony submitted by a courthouse source. . . . According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Mr Myers said he pleaded not guilty to the charges and the case was automatically dismissed under Ohio's criminal rules of procedure after no indictment was brought within 60 days. . Mr Myers said his job offer in Mr Santos's office was rescinded on 1 February.  . Last week, Mr Santos told Semafor he expected a progressive news website to publish recordings between the two men, saying: \"He's violated the trust that we had in him\". On Friday, Talking Points Memo published parts of a conversation the two had. . Mr Myers said he has not received any response to the letter from the House Ethics Committee, and that the Capitol Police told him a report would be ready on Monday, CBS reported. . \"These matters will hopefully be appropriately addressed by the police and the Ethics Committee, respectively in due time,\" Mr Myers said..

        "content": "A similar balloon was shot down in US airspace by military jets on Saturday amid allegations that it was being used for surveillance. . China has denied accusations of spying, saying it was monitoring the weather.. The incident has led to a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.. On Friday - .  - US military officials said a second Chinese balloon had been spotted over Latin America. . On Monday, China admitted an aircraft had \"accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace\".. Ms Mao told reporters the second balloon had \"deviated greatly\" from its intended route, citing the aircraft's \"limited manoeuvrability\" and the weather conditions.. \"The unmanned airship in question that came from China is of a civilian nature and used for flight tests,\" she added.. \"China is a responsible country and has always strictly abided by international law in order to inform and properly deal with all parties concerned, without posing any threat to any country.\". At the weekend, Colombia's air force said an object with \"characteristics similar to those of a balloon\" had been detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. Colombia said it had followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. Meanwhile, work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.. US President Joe Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. . The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites.. Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\".. \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty. A planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.. China has lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing over the incident.. ",

        "content": "Emergency rescue teams said many buildings are damaged or destroyed and that people remain trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,000 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said that families remain trapped under the rubble. . In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region are beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",
