        "content": "It says the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. . Moscow has denied the allegations and labelled the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move - the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and can only exercise jurisdiction within its member countries - and Russia is not one of them.. However it could affect the president in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally.. , the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. When asked about the ICC's move, US President Joe Biden said \"well, I think it's justified\". He noted that the US is not signed up to the ICC, \"but I think it makes a very strong point\". Mr Putin \"clearly committed war crimes\", he said.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. In the past, she has spoken openly of efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian children taken to Russia. . Last September, Ms Lvova-Belova complained that some children removed from the city of Mariupol \"spoke badly about the [Russian President], said awful things and sang the Ukrainian anthem.\". She has also claimed to have adopted a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol.. The ICC said it initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public in the event that it stopped further crimes from being committed.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told the BBC: \"children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported\".. \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be human being to know how egregious it is,\" he said.. Reactions to the warrants came within minutes of the announcement, with Kremlin officials instantly dismissing them.. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. \"No need to explain WHERE this paper should be used,\" he wrote on Twitter, with a toilet paper emoji.. However Russian opposition leaders welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Khan and the criminal court for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the decision was \"historic for Ukraine\", while the country's presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, lauded the decision as \"only the beginning\".. This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. But because Russia is not a signed member of the ICC, there is very little chance that Vladimir Putin or Maria Lvova-Belova will appear in the dock at The Hague. . The ICC relies on the cooperation of governments to arrest people, and Russia is \"obviously not going to cooperate in this respect\", Jonathan Leader Maynard, a lecturer in international politics at King's College London, told the BBC.. However Mr Khan pointed out that no-one thought . , the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, would end up in The Hague.. \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" he said.. Legally, however, this does present Mr Putin with a problem. . While he is the head of a G20 state, and about to . , Mr Putin is now also a wanted man, and this will inevitably place restrictions on which countries he can visit.. There is also a level of embarrassment for the Kremlin, which has always denied allegations of Russian war crimes, that such an influential, pan-national body as the ICC simply does not believe its denials..

        "content": "State officials said there was no immediate public health risk.. The leak was first discovered in late November, but state officials did not notify the public until Thursday.. The water contains tritium, a common by-product of nuclear plant operations.. A naturally occurring radioactive isotope of hydrogen, tritium emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far in air and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).. Tritium spills occur at nuclear plants on occasion, but are typically contained on-site and rarely affect public health or safety, the NRC says.. Xcel first discovered the leak on 21 November, from a pipe between two buildings at its Monticello plant. The plant is about 35 miles (56km) from the state's most populous city, Minneapolis, upstream along the Mississippi River.. The Minnesota Department of Health has said the leak did not reach the Mississippi River.. The company said it had notified the state and the NRC the next day.. \"If at any point there had been concern for the public safety, we would of course, immediately have provided more information. But we also wanted to make sure we fully understood what was going on before we started raising any concerns with the public around us,\" Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. . \"Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,\" the Minnesota-based utility said in a statement on Thursday.. State officials said they had waited to get more information before going public with the leak, but confirmed that the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.. On Friday, the mayor of Monticello defended the city's response, saying that city officials did not learn of the leak until \"the end of February\" and that the city does not have any authority over the power plant.. \"Though the Xcel plant is within our community, the City of Monticello does not have the authority to govern the nuclear plant,\" Mayor Lloyd Hilgart said in a statement saying that oversight is done by state and federal officials. . \"If state or federal oversight agencies determine that there is any potential or actual impact to the City's drinking water supply or infrastructure, the City will immediately notify the public with assistance from these agencies,\" he said.. Xcel Energy said crews inspected the plant at all points where leaks could occur and will be examining the leaked pipe in a lab. . Roughly one-quarter of the spilled tritium has been recovered so far, and Xcel has said it may build above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water.. It is also weighing how to treat, re-use or dispose of the collected tritium and water.. The company previously had a small leak at its Monticello plant in 2009.. ",

        "content": "Slovakia's fleet was grounded last year and it no longer uses the jets.. Ukraine has asked Western countries for modern jets, but because of long training times, these are seen only as long-term options.. It sees extra aircraft as important for its defences and possible counter-attacks, a year into Russia's invasion.. Other Nato countries are considering sending planes such as the MiG-29 - a model which dates from the time of the Soviet Union - which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the plans, saying that the aircraft would not affect the outcome of Moscow's \"special military operation\", as it calls the war.. He said they would only \"bring additional woes for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people\".. \"Of course, during the special military operation, all this equipment will be subject to destruction,\" the spokesman added.. The Polish and Slovak pledges are a positive move for Ukraine - which has more pilots than planes - but will not make a decisive difference. . The Ukrainians say what they really need is . . . Yuri Sak, a senior Ukrainian defence adviser, says the fourth-generation fighters have better capabilities.  . It still seems unlikely that Ukraine would get them - at least for now, as it would take time to train Ukrainian pilots on Western jets.. Western military officers remain sceptical about modern fighters. Their focus is on helping Ukraine win the battle on the ground. . The front lines are swamped with air defence systems on both sides. The Russian air force is much bigger than Ukraine's and it hasn't been able to gain control of the skies.. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.. On Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted that . He said \"promises must be kept\" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for more weapons.. It is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are operational.. Mr Heger said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.. On Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.. As with its pledge of Leopard tanks, Poland has broken a barrier. This was a step no-one was prepared to take a year ago.. News of the pledges came amid Russian media reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had decorated pilots involved in an incident earlier this week .. Washington has condemned the Russian actions, in which it says one of the Su-27 jets clipped the drone, as reckless, but Moscow says the drone failed on its own.. This video can not be played. Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jet. ",
