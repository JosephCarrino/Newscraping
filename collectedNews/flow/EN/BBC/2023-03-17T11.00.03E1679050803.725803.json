        "content": "The visit comes as Beijing, an ally of Russia, has offered proposals to end the war in Ukraine, to which the West has given a lukewarm reception.. Western countries have warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with weapons. . Beijing's foreign ministry said Mr Xi will be in Russia from 20 to 22 March at the invitation of Mr Putin. . A number of \"important bilateral documents\" are expected to be signed. . In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said it will be a trip \"for friendship and peace\".. \"On the basis of no-alliance, no-confrontation and no-targeting of any third party, China and Russia have been promoting greater democracy in international relations,\" she said. . She added that China would uphold \"an objective and fair position\" on the war in Ukraine and \"play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace\". . In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Xi Jinping to discuss Beijing's proposal. . \"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said.. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously said  - a claim denied by China. . US media reported on Friday that Mr Xi will speak virtually with Mr Zelensky after his visit to Russia, but this is yet to be confirmed. . China has thus far resisted Ukraine's lobbying for a meeting between Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky, even though Beijing confirmed on Friday that China's leader is to visit Moscow next week.. In an interview with the BBC before Mr Xi's visit was announced, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his president was ready for a telephone conversation with Mr Xi.. He added: \"I don't think China has reached the moment now… when it's ready to arm Russia. Nor do I think that this visit will result in peace… The visit to Moscow in itself is a message but I don't think it will have any immediate consequences.\". The message, Mr Kuleba said, was \"that China and Russia are very close, close enough for the Chinese leader to visit his Russian counterpart, who is not doing very well. . \"And I think this is the message to the entire world, to the West but also most importantly, to the non-West, that Russia is not alone, that China is talking to them.\". But the Ukrainian foreign minister added that Russia would have preferred more support from China.. \"Russia was looking for a different position of China since the beginning of the invasion. Russia did not get what it wants. Our understanding also is that Russia is becoming more and more dependent on China. So it's very complex.\". Asked about a report that the Ukrainian leader is set to talk to Mr Xi for the first time since Russia invaded, a US National Security Council spokesman said it would be \"a very good thing if the two of them talk\". . \"We support and have supported\" contact, John Kirby said. . Meanwhile, China's foreign minister on Thursday urged Kyiv and Moscow to restart peace talks \"as soon as possible\".. In a phone call, Qin Gang told Mr Kuleba that Beijing hopes \"all parties will keep calm, exercise restraint, resume peace talks as soon as possible and return to the track of political settlement\"..   and Mr Zelensky's \"Peace Formula for ending the aggression and restoring just peace in Ukraine\". .

        "content": "Watch: Uproar on the streets of Paris and jeers in parliament over retirement age increase. Crowds converged on Place de la Concorde in response to raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.. The plans had sparked two months of heated political debate and strikes.. Finally, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne invoked article 49:3 of the constitution - allowing the government to avoid a vote in the Assembly.. The decision was taken minutes before MPs were scheduled to vote on the controversial bill, because there was no guarantee of winning a majority.. The move caused fury among opposition politicians. Many jeered the prime minister, sang La Marseillaise and held up signs of protest in parliament.. A no-confidence motion will be filed against President Emmanuel Macron's government, far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen has suggested.. Leader of left-wing party La France Insoumise (LFI), Mathilde Panot, tweeted that Mr Macron had plunged the country into a government crisis, without parliamentary or popular legitimacy.. Thousands of people came out on the streets of Paris and other French cities to reject the move, singing the national anthem and waving trade union flags. . Some protesters clashed with police as evening fell. A fire was lit in the middle of the Place de la Concorde and police with shields and batons fired tear gas and moved to clear the square. . By nightfall, 120 people had been arrested, Paris police told AFP news agency.. But unions vowed to maintain their opposition to the pension changes, with the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) saying another day of strikes and demonstrations was being planned for Thursday 23 March.. The constitutional procedure that has prompted all this anger may sound obscure, but it is very much part of the political vocabulary in France. . Even though Mr Macron was re-elected last year on a platform of retirement reforms, his ruling coalition has no majority in the Assembly and would have needed support from the Republicans party to pass the pension changes.. Officials from Mr Macron's Renaissance party spent the morning desperately whipping members into line in a bid to pass their bill.. They knew some of their MPs could vote against or abstain, faced with the evident unpopularity of the bill, so they resorted to special constitutional powers.. But whenever a government invokes the 49:3, it can be sure it will be accused straight away of riding roughshod over the will of the people.. In fact, it has been used precisely 100 times in the more than 60 years of the Fifth Republic, and by governments of all shades.   . Obviously, it tends to be used more frequently by governments that do not have an in-built majority in parliament, such as the socialist Michel Rocard's in the 1980s and Élisabeth Borne's today.  . She has in fact already used it several times, but those occasions were for public finance bills which were less controversial.. Use of the procedure is a way to bypass a vote which might be lost, but the down side for the government is that the opposition parties can immediately table a vote of no-confidence. . If these are voted through, the government falls. That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.. The dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.. But the bill is regularly described by opponents as \"brutal\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\".. Morale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away. . This video can not be played. WATCH: French MPs boo PM and sing national anthem over pension reforms. ",

        "content": "Johnston began surfing early on Thursday morning in aid of mental health awareness.. His effort has raised some A$335,000 (£185,000; $225,000) for charity.. With spotlights to illuminate a section of Cronulla's surf known as \"The Alley\", Johnston kept going overnight and had ridden over 700 waves by the end. . The previous record of 30 hours and 11 minutes was held by South African Josh Enslin.. The 40-year-old Johnston, a former pro surfer and distance runner, faced the risk of blindness, infected ears and dehydration, as well as sleep deprivation, hypothermia, shark attack and jellyfish stings.. He emerged briefly from the sea at lunchtime on Friday for a medical check-up, and to receive eye-drops.. Johnston left the beach wearing a black cowboy hat while draped in a thermal blanket.. \"I surfed at two in the morning with him, and the lights actually went out so it was pitch black,\" his brother Ben told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. . \"There were a whole bunch of jellyfish out there, so it was interesting to say the least.\". Speaking ahead of his challenge, Johnston said: \"I thought, I could just do it. I can run for 40 hours,\". \"But, this way, I can surf with people, bring in the community and make a difference for the future.\". Johnston is fundraising for the Chumpy Pullin Foundation, set up in the memory of Australian Olympic snowboarder Alex 'Chumpy' Pullin who drowned off the Gold Coast while spearfishing in 2020. . He is also supporting mental health charities, partly in tribute to his father who took his own life a decade ago.. Three of his friends have also died from mental health conditions, according to media reports. . ",

        "content": "Recent bank collapses in the US have raised fears over the health of the banking system.. The UK's FTSE 100 share index opened higher on Friday.. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei index had closed up 1.2%, helped by banking and electronics shares.. The 11 US banks who announced the support said the action reflected their \"confidence in the country's banking system\".. US financial officials said: \"This show of support by a group of large banks is most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system.\"  . After the failure of two US banks in the past week - Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank - investors have been worried that other banks could also be about to collapse. . US regulators stepped in at the weekend to ensure that customers at SVB and Signature Bank had full access to their money.. Shares in San Francisco-based First Republic had sunk nearly 70% over the last week, amid fears it would be the next bank at risk of a rush of customers withdrawing their deposits. . But the rescue plan by the 11 banks, led by JP Morgan and Citigroup, boosted stock markets, and shares in First Republic were up more than 20% at one point.. However, there are signs that not all worries have been eased.. Shares in First Republic dropped 20% in after-hours stock market trading after the bank said its was suspending its dividend - its payment to shareholders - \"during this period of uncertainty\".. There have also been sign of wider strains in the banking sector. The US central bank has reported a surge in emergency lending to banks, with $318bn in outstanding loans as of Wednesday, up from $15bn a week earlier.  . Swetha Ramachandran, investment director at GAM Investments, said authorities were moving \"proactively\".. \"What they're trying to do is really ringfence the specific issues around individual isolated banks to stop them from becoming systemic,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.. \"So this is very different to 2008 which was a widespread issue across the banking sector.\". On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said \"the banking system overall is safe and sound\", while the vice president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Luis de Guindos, said Europe's banking sector was \"resilient\".. Europe has not escaped the jitters in the banking sector, due to difficulties at Swiss bank giant Credit Suisse.. Shares in Credit Suisse sank earlier in the week on concerns over its future, before the Swiss National Bank said on Wednesday that it was supplying the bank with up to £44bn in emergency funds.. Central banks around the world have sharply raised borrowing costs over the past year to try to curb the pace of overall price rises, or inflation. . The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower, a change that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about whether other firms are facing similar situation.. Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at US asset manager Payden and Regal, said other banks could be caught up in the problem.. \"There could be other vulnerabilities... if central banks are intent on continuing to raise interest rates,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.. \"Historically when that happens we do see fragility, we do see problems in the financial system. It wouldn't surprise me at all if other vulnerabilities do appear.\". Before the turbulence in the banking sector erupted, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates further at meetings next week. However, due to recent events, some have speculated these rate rises might be scaled back or even scrapped.. On Thursday, the ECB announced a further increase to interest rates from 2.5% to 3%.. \"For the ECB their core fight right now is against inflation,\" said GAM Investments' Ms Ramachandran.. \"While they're monitoring wider financial market stability, I think their view was that the Credit Suisse issues are idiosyncratic and contained to that specific bank.\" .

        "content": "Authorities interpreted the books - about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village - as referring to Hong Kongers and China's government.. The arrests are another deterioration of Hong Konger's rights, critics say.. Human Rights Watch described the arrests as \"shameful\", and said the territory was using its colonial-era sedition law to clamp down on dissent.. Hong Kong media reported police arrested the men, aged 38 and 50, at their apartments on 13 March. They raided their homes in Kowloon and Hong Kong island and seized multiple copies of the books, which are part of a series titled Yangcun.. Both men have been released on bail but must report to the police next month, authorities said.. Officials also confirmed the books were the same that had been the subject of a high-profile trial last year - where a court had to determine if the Yangcun books advocated for rebellion against the state. The court ruled the picture books had \"seditious intention\" and j.  for publishing the books.. The group, aged between 25 and 28, had produced cartoon e-books that some interpreted as trying to explain Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement to children.. In one of the three books, a village of sheep fight back against a group of wolves who are trying to take over their settlement.. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. Under its \"one country, two systems\" principle, residents are supposed to enjoy certain freedoms unavailable on the mainland.. But these rights have been eroded since Beijing in 2020 imposed a national security law in response to the months-long Hong Kong protests against Beijing's control in 2019.. Beijing said the law was needed to bring stability to the city - but critics said it was designed to squash dissent, and weaken Hong Kong's autonomy.. In January, police arrested a 24-year-old student for sedition after he posted a download link of the Yangcun series on Facebook - accompanied by alleged inflammatory statements, local outlet Mingpao reported..
