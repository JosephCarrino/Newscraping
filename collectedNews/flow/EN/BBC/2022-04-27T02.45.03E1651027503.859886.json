        "content": "The Bulgarian Energy Ministry also said it had been informed deliveries would be suspended from Wednesday. . It comes after Russia .  or it would cut supplies.. Both countries have refused to pay in this way. . PGNiG relies on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from the Russian company in the first quarter of this year.. It described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas. . Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. . The country's energy ministry said Bulgaria had fulfilled its obligations under the current contract with Gazprom and made all required payments. . It added that the new payment system proposed by Russia was in breach of the existing contract. . Following the news, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. . Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. . Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister, Marcin Przydacz, said his country had been preparing for the possibility Russia might limit gas exports by diversifying its supplies. . \"I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,\" he told the BBC. . He added that the suspension proved Moscow was \"not a reliable partner in any kind of business\" and urged other European nations like Germany to support a ban on Russian energy imports. . Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. . PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and, with summer approaching, demand was lower.. Poland also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. . On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is also due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal.. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the \"Baltic Pipe\", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries.. The gas supply cut does not mean Poland will immediately be unable to meet customer demand. . In recent years, Poland has reduced its dependence on Russian gas and it now buys LNG from Qatar and pipelines connect the country to the European market. Plus, the winter heating season is over, so demand is lower. . But Gazprom supplies more than half of all Poland's gas imports. That's a big hole to fill. . And Poland is not the only EU country now seeking to stop buying Russian energy. . There's a lot of competition on an already tight gas supply market. When the heating season starts again in the autumn and demand rises, Poland could face a tricky few months securing enough supply. . And if it does so, it may have to restrict supplies to large industrial users. . Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. . However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. . The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports.. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds.. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate. Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars. Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition leader, uncovers the truth. ",

        "content": "The discovery was made by a farmer digging his land in Khan Younis, in the south of the strip.. On social media, some Gazans are making wry comments suggesting the goddess's association with war seems apt.. In recent years, they have seen a series of devastating flare-ups in the conflict between Israel and militant groups in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.  . However, the discovery of this limestone statue is a reminder of how the strip - part of an important trade route for successive ancient civilisations - was originally a Canaanite settlement.. The 22cm-high (8.7 in) carving clearly shows the face of the goddess wearing a serpent crown.. \"We found it by chance. It was muddy and we washed it with water,\" said farmer Nidal Abu Eid, who came across the head while cultivating his field.  . \"We realised that it was a precious thing, but we didn't know it was of such great archaeological value,\" he told the BBC.. \"We thank God, and we are proud that it stayed in our land, in Palestine, since the Canaanite times.\" . The statue of Anat - one of the best-known Canaanite deities - is now on display in Qasr al-Basha, a historic building that serves as one of Gaza's few museums. . Unveiling the artefact at a press conference on Tuesday, Jamal Abu Rida of the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said the statue was \"resistant against time\" and had been carefully examined by experts.. He said that it made a political point.. \"Such discoveries prove that Palestine has civilisation and history, and no-one can deny or falsify this history,\" he said. \"This is the Palestinian people and their ancient Canaanite civilisation.\". Not all archaeological finds in Gaza have been so highly appreciated or fared so well.  . Hamas - an Islamist, militant organisation - has previously been accused of destroying the remains of a large, fortified Canaanite town, Tell al-Sakan, to make way for housing and military bases south of highly populated Gaza City.. , but later disappeared mysteriously.. However, this year Hamas reopened the remains of a 5th Century Byzantine church after foreign donors helped pay for a years-long restoration project.. Work also stopped at a building site in northern Gaza when 31 Roman-era tombs were found there.. While such ancient sites could potentially be a draw for foreign visitors, it has virtually no tourism industry. . Israel and Egypt tightly restrict the flow of people in and out of the impoverished coastal enclave, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, citing security concerns. .

        "content": "For 14 years, Lucio had been on death row for the 2007 death of her then-two year old daughter, Mariah.. But she has always maintained her innocence, saying that the toddler had died from an accidental fall, not from \"beating and torturing\", as prosecutors in Texas claimed.. Her cause was taken up by everyone from her living children - her eldest son the most vocal among them - to Kim Kardashian, the celebrity turned would-be lawyer.. Before her execution was stayed amid the emergence of new evidence, BBC spoke to her family and supporters.. It was 2007, and Melissa was living a difficult life with her then-husband Robert Antonio Alvarez and her 12 children, while she was pregnant with twins.. The family lived in \"extreme poverty,\" her lawyer Sandra Babcock told BBC. . \"Their electric service was cut, they moved some 26 times in a five-year period. For a time, the only access they had to water was through their neighbours' houses or from the parish.\". It was during one of those moves - on 15 February 2007 - that Melissa's two-year-old daughter was injured.  . According to Melissa's statements to the police, the little girl was left without adult supervision while her parents were busy.. At the time, the family lived in a small two-bedroom, second-floor flat.. Melissa later told police that when she realised that Mariah was no longer inside the unit, she left to look for her and found her crying by the staircase, with a bit of blood on her lower teeth.. After finding no other injuries, Melissa said she had continued on with her day.. Two days later, her father called police when Mariah suddenly stopped breathing.. She had fallen asleep on her parents' bed, but never woke up again. An autopsy later showed that the toddler had bruising to her kidney and lungs, according to local media.. Moments after learning about her daughter's death, Melissa was questioned by the police for over five hours, without food, beverage or sleep.. Prosecutors said she confessed after this police interrogation, and on the testimony of one of the agents who said he was \"convinced\" she was guilty, and on the injuries that Mariah's body had shown at the time of her death.. But lawyers and others of Melissa's supporters say she was made to make statements under duress.. \"They badgered, berated and yelled at her until she finally agreed to their demands and insistence that she was guilty of harming her child,\" said Ms Babcock, who argues that there was a \"rush\" to judge her guilty.. As a poor woman of minority background living in south Texas, she had no money to hire a lawyer and was instead given a court-appointed attorney, who made errors that resulted in an unfair trial, Melissa's current lawyers have said.. Evidence that could have helped Melissa, such as the testimony of expert witnesses and her other children, was not admitted into the original trial. The state did not test DNA or allow the defence's forensic pathologist to speak at the trial.. There were also allegations of corruption on the part of the prosecution, which did not figure into the case. Armando Villalobos, the district attorney who brought the charges, is now in jail for bribery unrelated to the Lucio case, but that took place when she was tried.. \"You start peeling back the layers and you see that it is a case about corrupt prosecutors, it's a case about unfairness,\" Ms Babcock said.. Villalobos could not be reached for comment. . In issuing a stay of execution on Monday, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said Melissa's case deserved further scrutiny given mistakes made during the original prosecution, as well as new information that has emerged over the past decade and a half while she has been in jail.. Campaigners took up Melissa's cause as one of a miscarriage of justice. . John Oliver, the comedian, featured the case in a segment on wrongful convictions on his HBO news programme last month, and Kim Kardashian earlier this month tweeted a letter to the Texas governor signed by nine of Melissa's children pleading for her life to be spared. Dozens of politicians from both parties have backed her. . Opinion is divided on her guilt, though - many of her living children have backed up her claim of innocence, and five of the jurors who convicted her have since expressed misgivings over the verdict. . According to local media, others are still convinced she is committed the crime - Melissa had a previously had a history of drug use and some of her children had been taken into care, the jurors heard at her trial - though there was no evidence of abuse. . But the attention the case has garnered helped spotlight the earlier errors in the trial and win a halt to what would be the first execution of a Hispanic woman carried out in Texas in modern times.. Upon learning that her execution had been stayed, Melissa said in a statement: \"I am grateful the Court has given me the chance to live and prove my innocence. Mariah is in my heart today and always. I am grateful to have more days to be a mother to my children and a grandmother to my grandchildren\".. The impact has been felt longest by Melissa's family. Before all this, \"we were a large family and we were very united\", her eldest son, John, told BBC.. \"Ever since this accident took place, there has been a great division amongst us. It simply has not been the same in the past 15 years,\" he said.. At the time of his mother's arrest, John was 17 years old. He has spent his entire adult life fighting for her release.. \"When all of this happened, our family split up,\" he said. His younger siblings were taken in by cousins, and many did well after leaving school. But the older children had it harder.. \"The older ones, we were more or less of age, we were the losers,\" he said woefully. \"Being the eldest was hard, not only because of the responsibility but because I would like to see our family together again.\". Now 32, John struggled with his own brushes with the law, but has tried to put his life back together again: he returned to school, he began running marathons and triathlons.. John has organised sitdowns seeking the release of his mother and said he will continue fighting.. \"I am not here to shout,\" he said. \"I am only here to do what can be done for my mother.\". While she technically remains on death row, her case is due to be reviewed again.. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate. Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars.

He accused Ukrainian soldiers of holding civilians as human shields. But Ukrainian defenders have said attacks are continuing and civilians are trapped.. America's top defence official warned the West it had to \"move at the speed of war\" to support Ukraine's military fight against the Russian invasion. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired four-star general, told a gathering of 40 nations' defence ministers that the coming weeks would be \"so crucial for Ukraine\". . Germany slightly shifted its position of not supplying weapons to Ukraine.

Russia supplies roughly 40% of the EU's gas imports, and the continent does not have enough to supply itself. Amid heightened tensions, Russia has demanded \"hostile countries\" pay it for energy in its own currency, roubles.. The World Bank says the war in Ukraine is set to cause the \"largest commodity shock\" since the 1970s - meaning huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton.. The increases will affect the poorest most, but households and business of all sizes will feel the effects.. Wheat is predicted to go up in price by almost 43% and reach new highs, chicken could go up nearly 42%, soybeans 20% and oil 30%.. ..
