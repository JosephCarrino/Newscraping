        "content": "It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter sends video from scene of fatal crash. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke after visiting the site of Tuesday night's head-on collision between a passenger service and a freight train. . The local stationmaster has been charged with manslaughter. The Greek transport minister has resigned.. Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors.. The accident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. The passenger train carrying some 350 people collided with a freight train as it emerged from a tunnel after leaving the town of Larissa.. It is still unclear why the two services were running on the same track.. The stationmaster, who is in charge of signalling, denies wrongdoing and has blamed the accident on a possible technical failure.. After visiting the site, Mr Mitsotakis said everything pointed to \"a tragic human error\".. \"Justice will do its job,\" he said in a televised address. \"People will be held accountable, while the state will be on the side of the people.\" . Announcing his resignation, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated: \"When something so tragic happens, it is impossible to continue and pretend it didn't happen.\" . Trade unions said collisions have multiple factors and the crash had highlighted chronic deficiencies, including lack of staff, broken signals and outdated facilities.. The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed and the first two caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\", Thessaly regional governor Kostas Agorastos said.. The train was travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki, which has a sizeable student population, and it is believed many on board were students returning there after a holiday for Greek Orthodox lent.. Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\".. Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage, told Reuters news agency: \"The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Larissa's mayor said some of those who died would only be identifiable through genetic testing.. Relatives of missing passengers have provided DNA samples to help the identify bodies, a hospital in Larissa said. . ",

        "content": "Jurors earlier in the day visited the sprawling, 1,700-acre hunting lodge to assess the crime scene.. The disbarred attorney denies involvement in the 7 June 2021 deaths.. Mr Murdaugh reported finding the bodies of his wife and son near the dog kennels on the property in South Carolina's Colleton County. . Over several hours on Wednesday afternoon, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters painstakingly led jurors through the state's theory.. At the time of the murders, Mr Waters said, a \"gathering storm\" was threatening to expose Mr Murdaugh's decade of financial crimes - crimes that Mr Murdaugh himself has admitted in court. . The murders of Maggie and Paul, Mr Waters said, were Mr Murdaugh's desperate attempt to gain sympathy and delay looming inquiries into his theft of millions of dollars.. The state's case has been limited by a lack of physical evidence - the murder weapons were not found, there were no eyewitnesses and no blood found on Mr Murdaugh's clothing. . But Mr Waters on Wednesday emphasised that Mr Murdaugh was with his wife and son just minutes before the killings, something the defendant had denied for 20 months before acknowledging it last week in court. . \"After an exhaustive investigation, there is only one person who had the motive, who had the means, who had the opportunity to commit these crimes, and also whose guilty conduct after these crimes betrays him,\" Mr Waters said.. The defence will present their closing arguments on Thursday. . Earlier this week, Mr Murdaugh's lawyer, Dick Harpootlian, asked Judge Clifton Newman to grant jurors time to visit the 1,700-acre estate, known as Moselle, to get a better idea of where the bodies were found relative to the kennels and the Murdaugh home, where Mr Murdaugh originally said he had been napping at the time of the killings.. \"You just can't really appreciate the spatial issues without really seeing them,\" Mr Harpootlian told the court on Monday. . Prosecutors, however, argued against granting jurors access to the estate, saying that the property has changed in the 20 months since the killings. . They said that some of the trees between the kennels and the Murdaugh home have grown taller and thicker.. Only the judge, members of the jury, police and security personnel were present for the visit, but members of the trial's media pool also paid a brief visit to the property on Wednesday morning.. \"It is a heavy place to visit,\" the Wall Street Journal's Valerie Bauerlein wrote in a pool report. \"The property has stood vacant for 20 months and the grass is high.\". After seeing the kennels, a nearby shed and feed room, she observed: \"There was no visible sign that two people had died in a violent manner in such close proximity, no blood stain or anything similar to it.\". Moselle is where the family lived for several years. It includes their home, as well as dog kennels, a cabin and sprawling lands, fields and forests, where Mr Murdaugh would hunt with his two sons.. The estate is now listed under contract at $3.9m (£3.9m), . .. Mr Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster, testified that much of the estate is \"really not even accessible\" because it is filled with swamps and there are no built roadways in many parts.. If convicted, Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years in jail, though prosecutors have argued for a life sentence.. This video can not be played. Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial. ",

        "content": "The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders.. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea.. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea's son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk. . The OCCRP claimed in a .  that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports.. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material.. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials.. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.  . NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa.. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle.. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. . The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa's Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled . .. The story examined Mr Ayuk's involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians. . After the story was published, the M&G's web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet's entire website for a morning in response to the complaint. . M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website. . Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\".. Last November during the UN's climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called . .. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN's flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk's US fraud conviction. . The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication.. Two weeks later, Climate Home News' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered.. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed. . Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles.. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\". Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered.. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\". . Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\". When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims. . Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication.. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.. ",

        "content": "It is a growing issue for people in the area, her lawyer told BBC News. . The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",

The visit comes days after China sent its top diplomat . . . Mr Lukashenko and Mr Xi's meeting also coincided with a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Central Asian nations to discuss the Ukraine war.. On Wednesday, China and Belarus \"expressed deep concern\" about the conflict and \"extreme interest in the soonest possible establishment of peace in Ukraine\", the Belarus state-run news agency Belta reported.. Mr Lukashenko has aided the Russian leader in his war in Ukraine, and observers have seen his trip to Beijing as another sign of China closing ranks with Russia and its allies.. The Belarus leader praised China's peace plan.. The 12-point document urges respect for \"the sovereignty of all countries\". It does not specifically say Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", an implicit criticism of Ukraine's Western allies.. Mr Lukashenko said he \"fully supports the initiative on international security you have put forward\", according to remarks released by his aides.. Political decisions \"should be aimed at first and foremost preventing a slide into a global confrontation that will see no winners\", he told Mr Xi.. China's peace plan was met with general distrust in the West.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed with some parts of it and said it was a sign of China's willingness to engage. Beijing has so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit. . The Chinese leader called for discarding \"all Cold War mentality\", according to a Chinese readout of the meeting with Mr Lukashenko.. Mr Xi added that countries \"should stop politicising\" the world economy and to \"do things that will aid a ceasefire, cessation of war, and a peaceful resolution\".. Mr Lukashenko's three-day visit comes after China upgraded the status of its relationship with Belarus in September, several months into the Ukraine war.. Chinese foreign ministry statements have described their ties as an \"all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership\", a rare term that has been used for only one other country - Pakistan.. This means Belarus ranks very highly in China's hierarchy of international relationships, just below Russia, according to a BBC Monitoring analysis. . Belarus has been a key ally for Russia from the very beginning of the conflict when it allowed Moscow to use the Belarusian border with Ukraine as a launchpad for an attack on Kyiv, which eventually failed.. China, meanwhile, has attempted to appear neutral by stating support for both sovereignty and the right to national security, which are Ukraine and Russia's respective interests.. But Beijing has also refused to condemn Moscow and supported their war effort in indirect ways. Chinese state media has actively propagated Russian's view on the war, according to multiple analyses. . The Chinese government .  that it was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. . \"We do not accept the United States' finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about the allegations.. Chinese firms are also accused of supplying dual-use technology - goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as drones and semi-conductor chips - to Russia.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. Wednesday's visit took place as the US made its own diplomatic push, with Mr Blinken touring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In a speech in Uzbekistan, he noted the war had \"fostered deep concern across the region\" and stressed the US' commitment to sovereignty.. \"After all, if a powerful country is willing to try to erase the borders of a sovereign neighbour by force, what's to stop it from doing the same to others? Countries across Central Asia understand this,\" he said.. All five Central Asian countries are former members of the Soviet Union who have trade ties with Russia and China. But they have largely remained neutral during the war, adhered to Western sanctions and expressed unease at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also an ex-Soviet state.. ",
