        "content": "Watch: Armed police storm a building in Hamburg. Police say a gunman is believed to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among six or seven fatalities reported by German media.. As yet, \"there is no reliable information on the motive\", police say.. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelb√∂ge street in the city's Gross Borstel district.. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. . Officers who went in found people who \"may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally\", he said.. \"The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled.\". He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued.. \"All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals,\" Mr Vehren said.. The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, at around 21:00 (20:00 GMT) telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".. Residents nearby were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.. Hamburg's Interior Minister, Andy Grote, said on Twitter that police special forces and a large number of officers had been deployed to the scene.. Police have appealed to the public not to share assumptions or to spread rumours.. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement.. The denomination was founded in the USA towards the end of the 19th century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. The headquarters of the movement is in New York.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. . \"Today's loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,\" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).. Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Mr Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "A letter from the Scorpions Group was allegedly left with the men which apologised to the people of Matamoros, to the US victims and their families, and to a Mexican woman killed last week when the gang fired on a white minivan the Americans were travelling in. . The Associated Press says it has obtained a copy of the letter from a law enforcement official in the state of Tamaulipas. . \"We have decided to turn over those who were directly involved and responsible for the events\", the letter reads, saying the five had \"acted under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\". The letter also accuses the men of breaking the cartel's rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\".  . This video can not be played. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Meanwhile, a health clinic in Matamoros where the cartel members allegedly took the injured US citizens for treatment has been cordoned off by police. Reports suggest the four Americans were taken there by the gang but the two with the worst injuries - Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown - died soon after.  . Reuters news agency reported that Mexican officials had given the bodies of the two dead men to US officials in Matamoros on Thursday afternoon, and their remains were repatriated. . The latest developments come as some doubts have been cast in Mexico on the initial version of events. The group were said to have travelled to Matamoros for one of them, Latavia McGee, to undergo a cosmetic medical procedure at a clinic in the city. Her three friends were said to have accompanied her to the appointment.  . However, the Reuters news agency has reported that three of the four Americans had convictions for mainly minor drug-related offences - but one was charged with manufacturing banned narcotics with the intent to distribute.  . Reuters says it's seen an internal law enforcement document which shows the Mexican authorities are investigating the possibility the four Americans were kidnapped having been mistaken for rival cartel members encroaching on their turf. . The question over the Americans' backstory comes as the political temperature over the incident in Matamoros continues to rise. In the United States, several Republican politicians, among them the Senator for South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, have called for the use of US military force against Mexico's drug cartels. . Specifically, he's proposing a plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as \"Foreign Terrorist Organisations\" in order to, as he put it, \"unleash the fury and might of the United States against (them)\". . That rhetoric prompted a furious response in Mexico from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who said \"Mexico was not a protectorate or a colony of the United States\". His sentiments were echoed by the Foreign Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, who called Senator Graham's proposal for military intervention \"unacceptable\". . Amid the tense relations, the US Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall, is in Mexico for a meeting with President Lopez Obrador to discuss the worsening crisis over fentanyl and synthetic opioids in the US.  .
