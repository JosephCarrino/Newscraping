        "content": "It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter sends video from scene of fatal crash. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke after visiting the site of Tuesday night's head-on collision between a passenger service and a freight train. . The local stationmaster has been charged with manslaughter. The Greek transport minister has resigned.. Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors.. The accident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. The passenger train carrying some 350 people collided with a freight train as it emerged from a tunnel after leaving the town of Larissa.. It is still unclear why the two services were running on the same track.. The stationmaster, who is in charge of signalling, denies wrongdoing and has blamed the accident on a possible technical failure.. After visiting the site, Mr Mitsotakis said everything pointed to \"a tragic human error\".. \"Justice will do its job,\" he said in a televised address. \"People will be held accountable, while the state will be on the side of the people.\" . Announcing his resignation, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated: \"When something so tragic happens, it is impossible to continue and pretend it didn't happen.\" . Trade unions said collisions have multiple factors and the crash had highlighted chronic deficiencies, including lack of staff, broken signals and outdated facilities.. The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed and the first two caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\", Thessaly regional governor Kostas Agorastos said.. The train was travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki, which has a sizeable student population, and it is believed many on board were students returning there after a holiday for Greek Orthodox lent.. Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\".. Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage, told Reuters news agency: \"The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Larissa's mayor said some of those who died would only be identifiable through genetic testing.. Relatives of missing passengers have provided DNA samples to help the identify bodies, a hospital in Larissa said. . ",

        "content": "Many Iranians suspect the poisonings are a deliberate attempt to force girls' schools to close. . But the government has not said whether it believes they are premeditated. . Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, who has been tasked by the president with finding the \"root cause\" of the poisonings, on Wednesday dismissed as \"false\" a report by Fars news agency that three people had been arrested.. He also accused foreign-based and \"mercenary groups\" of taking advantage of the situation to wage psychological war and worry people.. Some pupils and parents suggested that schoolgirls may have been targeted for taking part in recent anti-government protests.. At least 26 schools in five cities across Iran were affected by the latest gas poisonings, local media and activists said.. BBC Persian verified videos showing ambulances arriving at schools and students being treated in hospitals in the capital Tehran, the north-western city of Ardabil and the western city of Kermanshah. . In one from Tehransar, in western Tehran, several girls purportedly from 13 Aban School are seen . .. Another video from the city's east shows . . A mother is then seen rushing up to the gate and screaming: \"Where is my child?\" A man replies: \"They've poisoned the students with gas.\". Authorities are under increasing pressure from the public to stop the poisonings, which were initially concentrated in the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Tehran.. Research by BBC Persian established that at least 830 students, mostly schoolgirls, had been poisoned as of Sunday, while a member of parliament put the figure at 1,200 in Qom and the western city of Borujerd alone as of Tuesday.. Those affected have reported the smell of tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill.. The chairman of the parliamentary education committee, Alireza Monadi-Sefidan, was quoted by Fars as saying on Tuesday that an investigation had found that the toxic gas contained nitrogen.. However, the interior minister told reporters on Wednesday that reports saying a specific chemical substance had been detected were incorrect.. One parent told the BBC that girls at their daughter's school in the Tehran suburb of Pardis were poisoned on Tuesday. . \"My daughter and two of her friends say they heard something like an explosion and immediately afterwards an unpleasant smell - something like burned plastic filled the air,\" said the parent, who the BBC is not identifying for safety reasons. . \"They were asked to leave the class and go into the yard. Many of the students started collapsing in the yard. There are kids with asthma and heart problems in my daughter's class.\" . \"Ambulances and the police arrived. Kids were given milk by the ambulance staff.\". On Sunday, Deputy Health Minister Younes Panahi said it was \"evident that some people wanted all schools, especially girls' schools, to be closed down\", although he later said that his remarks had been misunderstood.. Some people have speculated that the schoolgirls are being targeted as \"payback\" for their role in the mass protests that erupted in September after the death in custody of, Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf \"properly\".. Authorities have portrayed the protests as \"riots\" and responded with lethal force. Human rights groups have reported that hundreds of protesters have been killed, among them dozens of children. . In another video posted online on Wednesday, . , and that their headteacher then announced that some students were unwell and ambulances were being called. . The woman then talks to a young girl, who wonders whether they were \"chosen\" because they had taken part in the protests. . Public anger at the poisonings and the authorities' response have prompted fresh unrest. . A second video from Tehransar on Wednesday showed .  - the main slogan of the protest movement - as well as \"Death to the child-killing government.\" . The parent from Pardis said: \"We arrived at the school, angry and worried. Parents started shouting slogans against [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei.\" . \"Nobody believes they will investigate these attacks,\" they added. \"I have no hope in the system. But I hope the world will hear our voice and stop supporting these child killers.\". Officials reported that 35 students from their daughter's school were taken to hospital after the poisoning. But the parent said the actual number was much higher. . \"From my conversations with parents and the school principal, half of the students were taken to hospitals. That is at least 200 students.\". One of those children was in a coma, they said, adding: \"Some parents have also refused to take their children to hospital because they are afraid and don't trust the officials.\". ",

At least 38 people died and dozens more were injured in the head-on collision between two trains near the city of Larissa on Tuesday night.. The front carriages of a passenger train involved were mostly destroyed.. \"We heard a big bang,\" said 28-year-old passenger Stergios Minenis, who jumped to safety from the wreckage.. \"We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. . \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\". The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames, shortly before midnight local time. . It is being described as the worst train crash Greece has ever seen.. An investigation has been launched and police say they have arrested a local station master in Larissa. . Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming - some people were afraid they were going to die.\".

Angelos Tsiamouras told Greek broadcaster ERT the crash had felt like an earthquake, and he smashed the train window using his suitcase. \"We broke the windows with our backs,\" another unnamed passenger said. . One survivor, Lazos, told the newspaper Protothema: \"I wasn't hurt, but I was stained with blood from other people who were injured near me.\". Many of the 350 passengers on board the passenger train were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis said the exact number of dead is still unclear, amid reports there are 20-25 people still missing. However, officials say some may have left the scene without being accounted for.. Mr Karamanlis later resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage reached 1,300C (2,370F), which \"makes it hard to identify the people who were inside\".. One woman told Greek channel ANT1 her 23-year-old cousin, who was speaking to his mother on the phone from the passenger train shortly before the line cut, is still missing. . \"His mother has been looking for him since dawn,\" she added..
