        "content": "\"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said.. China's plan calls for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty.. However, the 12-point document does not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and it also condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", in what is seen as a veiled criticism of Ukraine's allies in the West. . The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit with Mr Xi.. Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. \"We share Beijing's views,\" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said .  - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.. Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?. \"I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,\" he added.. China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC's World Affairs Editor John Simpson. . The Chinese proposals follow a visit by the country's top diplomat Wang Yi to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.. After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China's state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to \"deepen political trust\" and \"strengthen strategic coordination\" with Moscow.. Western officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing \"doesn't have much credibility\" because it had \"not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine\".. President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine's north, east and south.. But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.. The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. At a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory \"will inevitably await us\" if allies \"respect their promises and deadlines\".. Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. . The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.. The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after .  during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia's invasion. . \"We didn't work well for many years, we didn't pay attention, I think it's a big mistake,\" he said.. Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.. \"What I saw. It was horrible,\" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.. The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.. The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.. The White House's fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. . A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.. Moldova is Europe's poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. It comes days after US President .  and held talks with Mr Zelensky.. On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions on technology that has a civilian and military dual use.. ",

        "content": "But this time, there is also a strong challenge from a third-party candidate - the Labour Party's Peter Obi, who is backed by many young people.. Current President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping aside after serving two four-year terms.. His All Progressives Congress (APC) is represented by former Lagos governor Bola Tinubu, while former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar is standing for the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There are a total of 18 presidential candidates.. The lead-up to the polls has been overshadowed by a cash shortage caused by a botched attempt to redesign the currency, leading to widespread chaos at banks and cash machines as desperate people sought access to their money. . The new notes were introduced in order to tackle inflation, and also vote-buying. On the eve of the election a member of the House of Representatives was . , and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say.. Whoever wins will have to deal with the currency redesign, a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. After the killing of a senatorial candidate on Wednesday by suspected gunmen from the separatist group, Ipob, the parliamentary election was postponed in the south-eastern Enugu East constituency.. The election has seen a huge interest from first-time voters and young people - a third of the 87 million eligible voters are below 35 - which may lead to a high voter turn-out than the 35% recorded in 2019.. \"It is my responsibility and I have seen how important it is to vote,\" 19-year-old first-time-voter Blessing Ememumodak told the BBC in Lagos.. Mr Obi, 61, is hoping to break up Nigeria's two-party system after joining the Labour Party last May. . Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the south.. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\" say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for Obi is wasted as he is unlikely to win.. Instead, the PDP, which ruled until 2015, wants Nigerians to vote for Atiku Abubakar, 76 - the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north.. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. . Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman. . Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity. . Its candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, during his two terms as governor until 2007. . He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies. . Voting is expected to begin at 08:30 local time (07:30 GMT), though anyone in the queue before it ends at 14:30 will be allowed to vote.. Elections are also being held for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives, with that for governors holding in March.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has promised free and fair elections, and has dismissed talk of postponement amid fears of insecurity in parts of the country and the cash shortage that many feared might affect its preparations.. It is the first time Inec will conduct national elections using the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), a facial and fingerprints technology that is thought to improve transparency by making it harder for politicians to rig the process. . Final results have been announced on the third day after voting in the last two elections, but they may come in earlier this time because of BVAS, which also uploads vote results directly to the Inec website direct from polling stations.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner. If no-one achieves that, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. This video can not be played. Which challenges face female politicians in Nigeria?. ",

Crypto is digital currency that can be \"mined\" through specialised computer processors.. Because of the heavy computer calculations needed to verify transactions, such mining uses huge amounts of electricity.. Authorities were first alerted to the possible crypto-mining operation in December 2021, said Cohasset Police Chief William Quigley in a statement to the BBC. . Mr Quigley said the operation was being run from a remote crawl space that was discovered beneath Cohasset High School by its director of facilities. . \"Detectives interviewed the director, who said that during a routine inspection of the school he noticed electrical wires, temporary ductwork, and numerous computers that seemed out of place,\" Mr Quigley said. . Investigators discovered computers in the crawl space, and learned they were being used in a cryptocurrency mining operation that was illegally plugged into the school's electrical system, police said. . After a three-month investigation with the help of the US Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security, police identified the suspect as Mr Nahas. . The mining operation had been running from April to December 2021, and cost the high school about $17,500 (£14,600) in electricity, according to court records seen . Mr Nahas worked for the Town of Cohasset from January 2021 until his resignation early last year. . The BBC asked Cohasset Public Schools district for comment, and were referred back to the police statement on the matter. .

        "content": "He is one of at least four journalists being investigated for reporting or commenting on the earthquake.. Press freedom groups say dozens more have been detained, harassed or prevented from reporting.. At least 50,000 people were killed when earthquakes hit both Turkey and Syria. . Turkey's authorities have not commented on the detentions.. On the night of the earthquake, Mr Koçer - who is Kurdish and contributes to pro-opposition news sites such as Bianet and Duvar - was smoking on his balcony in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, when his two dogs suddenly started barking. . He later remembered how they had barked just like that in 2020, seconds before a smaller earthquake hit eastern Turkey.. \"I felt I was shaking. I felt the house shaking, I felt the TV shaking,\" says Mr Koçer. He hid under a dinner table with the dogs and then rushed outside.. Mr Koçer left Diyarbakir and drove to the city of Gaziantep. He was shocked by scenes of destruction and victims enduing freezing temperatures in towns near the very epicentre of the quake.. At least 3,000 of the earthquake's victims died in Gaziantep. . \"When holding the microphone, behind the camera or in front of the camera, I could not hold back my tears,\" Mr Koçer recalls.. Mr Koçer was touched by the influx of volunteers and rescue teams coming from Western Turkey, and he shared their stories on Twitter. Some of the survivors told him they received no aid for days. Similar complaints were cited across pro-opposition media outlets. . Visiting the earthquake-affected areas, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the people he would rebuild their cities. But he also warned that those spreading \"fake news\" and \"causing social chaos\" would be prosecuted, calling them \"provocateurs\".. Mr Koçer says that while he was reporting from the region hit by the earthquake, Diyarbakir police left a note at his apartment, instructing him to visit the police station and give a statement.. At the station, he was told that he was being investigated under a recently introduced disinformation law. He said the police questioned him about his reporting from the earthquake epicentre and accused him of spreading false information. . Turkey's new law was adopted in October. It criminalised the public spreading of disinformation and gave the state much broader powers to control news sites and social media. . The Venice Commission, a legal watchdog of the Council of Europe, said the law would interfere with freedom of expression. . Opposition parties call it a \"censorship law\".. Mr Koçer insists that he was meticulous in his work and interviewed all sides, from survivors to the police, the gendarmerie and rescue workers. \"I did not share information without thorough research and analysis,\" he says.. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called the investigation against Mr Koçer \"absurd\" and urged the authorities to drop it. . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an advocacy group, at least three more journalists are facing criminal charges.. Merdan Yanardağ and Enver Aysever are prominent Istanbul-based political commentators with large social media followings. Both have criticised the government's rescue efforts. They're both under investigation along with Mehmet Güleş, who, like Mr Koçer, is based in Diyarbakir. He was detained on suspicion of \"inciting hatred\" for interviewing a volunteer critical of the government's rescue effort and later released, according to RSF.. The number of other journalists under investigation is unclear. On Tuesday, the police said they detained 134 people over \"provocative posts\" and arrested 25 of them, but their identities have not been disclosed. Some of those detained may well have been spreading falsehoods, including one that Afghan migrants had been scavenging in ruined neighbourhoods.. But critics say the clampdown has gone far beyond those spreading harmful disinformation. . \"The government is trying to suppress information coming from the quake zone,\" says cyber rights expert Yaman Akdeniz who teaches at the Istanbul Bilgi University. . The arrests came after Turkey's presidential communications director warned against \"lethal disinformation\" jeopardising the rescue efforts. The directorate also rolled out a smartphone app called \"Disinformation Reporting Service\" encouraging people to report manipulative posts about the quake. . \"Any time [Turkish] officials and the government are being criticised, they don't like it,\" says Arzu Geybulla, a journalist in Istanbul covering digital authoritarianism and censorship.. \"But this time they are perhaps more vocal.\". The BBC contacted Turkey's presidential directorate for communications asking about the journalists investigated and the calls by advocacy groups to drop investigations, but has had no response. . ",
