        "content": "Dramatic footage showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris in Jindayris.. A doctor at a hospital in nearby Afrin said she was now in a stable condition. . The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border.. The baby's uncle, Khalil al-Suwadi, said relatives had rushed to the scene when they learned of the collapse.. \"We heard a voice while we were digging,\" he told AFP news agency on Tuesday. \"We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord [intact], so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.\". Paediatrician Hani Maarouf said the baby had arrived at his hospital in a bad condition, with \"several bruises and lacerations over all her body\".. \"She also arrived with hypothermia because of the harsh cold. We had to warm her up and administer calcium,\" he added. . She was photographed lying in an incubator and connected to a drip, as a joint funeral was held for her mother Afraa, father Abdullah and her four siblings.. They are among 1,800 people known to have been killed by the earthquake in Syria, according to the Damascus-based government and the White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders operate in opposition-held areas. . Another 4,500 people have been killed in Turkey, where the epicentre was.  . The White Helmets have so far reported 1,020 deaths, but they have warned that figure is expected to \"rise dramatically\".. \"Time is running out. Hundreds still trapped under the rubble. Every second could mean saving a life,\" they tweeted on Tuesday. . \"We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and international bodies to provide material support and assistance to organisations responding to this disaster.\". The UN has vowed to use \"any and all means\" possible to get aid to people in the north-west, but it has said that deliveries have been halted temporarily due to damaged roads and other logistical issues.. It has also urged governments not to politicise aid delivery when so many are in desperate need. . A UN Security Council agreement authorises the use of just one border crossing for deliveries from Turkey into the north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of \"cross-line\" aid.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people in the north-west - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian aid to survive.. ",

        "content": "Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said the project posed an unacceptable risk to the World Heritage area, which is already highly vulnerable.. The mine's owner, the controversial Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, has not yet responded to the rejection. . His firm, Central Queensland Coal, had proposed to build an open-cut mine about 700km north-west of Brisbane, that would produce both thermal and coking coal and operate for about 20 years.. Ms Plibersek had last year flagged that the federal government might block the mine. After opening it to public consideration, her department received more than 9,000 submissions in 10 days - the majority calling for the project to be stopped.. The Great Barrier Reef - the world's largest coral reef system - has suffered .  due to rising sea temperatures and its outlook is \"very poor\", authorities say.. The Queensland state government had last year also recommended their federal counterparts reject the proposal, saying the environmental risks were \"significant\".. Minister Plibersek's department agreed, finding sediment and run off from the open-cut mine was likely to damage the Reef and local water resources.. \"I've decided that the adverse environmental impacts are simply too great,\" the minister said in a video statement on Wednesday.. While state governments have rejected proposals before, it is the first time a federal Environment Minister has used their powers to do so.. Australia's Labor government - elected in May - has been under pressure from some quarters to block any future coal and gas mining projects.. The country cannot help to stop catastrophic climate change - or keep global warming below a 1.5C increase this century - if it allows new mines, environmental advocates like the Greens political party say.. Australia is a major global supplier of fossil fuels. When exports are factored in, the country accounts for producing 3.6% of the world's emissions, but with only 0.3% of the world's population.. While the new government has significantly increased Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target, it has also said it will approve any new fossil fuel projects that make commercial sense.. ",
