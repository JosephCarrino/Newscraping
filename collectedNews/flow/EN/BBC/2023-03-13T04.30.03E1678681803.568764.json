        "content": "The taxpayer will not bear any losses from the move, the statement said.. SVB was .  who seized its assets on Friday.. It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. The move came as the firm, a key tech lender, was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. \"The US banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,\" the authorities' joint statement said.. \"Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe.\". Those actions also apply to Signature Bank of New York, seen as the most vulnerable institution after SVB, which came under regulatory control on Sunday.. As part of their moves to restore confidence, regulators also unveiled a new way to give banks access to emergency funds. . The Federal Reserve said it would offer assistance through a new Bank Term Funding Program, making it easier for banks to borrow from it in a crisis.. President Joe Biden said the American people could have \"confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them\".. SVB was seen as a crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector. It was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. I've been speaking to people with money stuck in SVB over the weekend. . One founder told me had been constantly refreshing his online banking page, hoping it might work. . Another said he was confident the government would step in, but admitted he might have lost about around 40% of the company's cash overnight. . This statement, then, has been welcomed by depositors. But there are those that will raise eyebrows at this move. . SVB mainly banked start-ups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley - the tech elite.  And those Silicon Valley elites tend to have more than a streak of libertarianism to their politics: the boilerplate view is that government is slow and too big. . Critics argue that it's with great irony that it's the government who has stepped in to save the day. Some will wonder whether influential tech bros have been given preferential treatment: capitalism for when things go well, socialism for when it doesn't. . It's why the statement is worded carefully that taxpayers will not be paying for this. Mr Biden will now have to defend the move - and reassure members of his own party that guaranteeing depositors was the only way. . SVB started as a California bank in 1983 and expanded rapidly over the last decade. . But it came under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks, which can happen in the blink of an eye in the digital age. But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. Meanwhile, . . A consortium of investors led by the Bank of London, a UK clearing bank, has submitted a formal bid to the UK Treasury. . The British government has been working on a plan to support UK tech firms affected by the collapse of SVB.. ",

He told the audience: \"Dreams are something you have to believe in - I almost gave up on mine.\".

The Whale - which launched Brendan Fraser's comeback - took best make-up and hairstyling, while Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio was named best animated feature.. Taking to the stage, the Mexican filmmaker said: \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre and animation is ready to be taken to the next step.\". All Quiet on the Western Front scored best international feature and best cinematography, while .  was named best live action short film.. Wakanda Forever's Ruth Carter repeated the best costume design victory she scored with the original film. She dedicated the prize to her mother, who died aged 101 last week..

In his speech, director Daniel Roher dedicated the award to Navalny and political prisoners around the world, saying: \"Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to the world.\". Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, added: \"Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free, stay strong my love.\". Later in the ceremony, Everywhere All at Once is the favourite to win best picture after success on this year's awards' circuit.. But it faces competition from All Quiet on the Western Front and The Banshees of Inisherin, among others.. Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser, Cate Blanchett and Yeoh are the frontrunners in the leading actor and actress categories.   . The 95th Academy Awards ceremony is being hosted by US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel, who opened with a monologue which reflected on the last 12 months in the film industry.. \"They say Hollywood is running out of ideas. I mean Steven Spielberg had to make a movie about Steven Spielberg,\" he joked, referring to the director's autobiographical best picture nominee The Fabelmans.. He also paid tribute to composer John Williams, the oldest nominee in Oscars history. \"John turned 91 last month, and he's still scoring, if you know what I mean,\" Kimmel quipped.. Reflecting on the mixed year Hollywood has had, Kimmel said: \"Batgirl became the first superhero to be defeated by the accounting department.\". The US comic also made reference to Avatar: The Way of Water, which he said was \"another opportunity for James Cameron to do what he loves doing more than anything else - drowning Kate Winslet\" (the actress also appeared in Cameron's Titanic)..

Later in the ceremony, Kimmel brought Jenny, the donkey who appears in the film, on stage. Her co-star Colin Farrell put his hand on his heart from the audience, while the audience cheered.. Finally - Kimmel referenced the event that overshadowed last year's ceremony - . \"If anyone here commits an act of violence during the show, you will be awarded best actor, and permitted to give a 19-minute speech,\" Kimmel said, to much laughter.. This is the chat show host's third time hosting the Academy Awards. He most recently presided over the 2018 event.. Viewers in the US can watch the Oscars live on ABC.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The Wagner mercenary group is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. But on Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. ",

        "content": "It adds that accounting firms in London and the British Virgin Islands acted for UK companies involved in the deals.. The story raises fresh doubts about the UK's efforts to tackle illegal wealth. . British authorities have long been accused of not doing enough to prevent criminals from overseas using UK property to launder money.. The report says the ease with which Karimova obtained UK property was \"concerning\".. There is no suggestion that those acting for the companies linked to her were aware of any connection to her nor that the source of funds could have been suspicious. No-one who provided those services in the UK has been investigated or fined. . For a time Gulnara Karimova was tipped to succeed her father, Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan as president of the central Asian state from 1989 until his death in 2016. She appeared in pop videos under the stage name \"Googoosha\", ran a jewellery company and served as ambassador to Spain. . But then in 2014 she disappeared from public view. It later emerged she had been detained on corruption charges while her father was still in power and she was sentenced in December 2017. In 2019 she was sent to prison for breaching the terms of her house arrest. . Prosecutors accused her of being part of a criminal group that controlled assets of more than $1bn (£760m) in 12 countries, including the UK, Russia and United Arab Emirates. \"The Karimova case is one of the largest bribery and corruption cases of all time,\" says Tom Mayne, one of the researchers on the Freedom For Eurasia report and a research fellow at the University of Oxford. . This video can not be played. Googoosha in the video for her single Round Run. However, Karimova and her associates had already sold some of the property allegedly acquired with corrupt funds.. Freedom For Eurasia researched property and land registry records to identify at least 14 properties which it says were purchased before she arrested, with allegedly suspicious funds, in various countries, including the UK, Switzerland, France, Dubai and Hong Kong.. The report to be published on Tuesday 14 March, titled Who Enabled the Uzbek Princess?, focuses on five properties bought in and around London, now worth an estimated £50m - including three flats in Belgravia, just west of Buckingham Palace, a house in Mayfair and an £18m Surrey manor house with a private boating lake.. Two of the Belgravia flats were sold in 2013 before Karimova was detained. In 2017, the house in Mayfair, the Surrey mansion and a third flat in Belgravia were frozen by the Serious Fraud Office. . Freedom For Eurasia's report also names firms in London and the British Virgin Islands that it claims were used by Karimova or associates to enable them to spend the proceeds of crime on the properties as well as on private jetliner. . Karimova's boyfriend, Rustam Madumarov, and others now alleged to be associates of hers were listed in official documents as the \"beneficial owners\" - a legal term for the person who ultimately is in control - of companies based in the UK, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands. But the report says they were just proxies for Karimova, who used the firms to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.. Accountancy services for two UK companies linked to Karimova - Panally Ltd and Odenton Management Ltd - were provided by SH Landes LLP, a firm formerly located on New Oxford Street in London.. In late July 2010, SH Landes sought to register or acquire another company. The aim was to purchase a private jet for around $40m (£33m), with Madumarov named as the beneficial owner. In fact, according to the report, Karimova was really behind the purchase.. When asked at the time about the source of his funds, SH Landes replied: \"We believe that the question regarding his personal wealth is not relevant in this situation.\" This was seemingly because the money to buy the jet were not being provided by Madumarov out of his personal funds.. The London-based firm later said Madumarov's wealth came partly from a mobile phone company based in Uzbekistan, Uzdonrobita. Questions had already been raised about the company's possible links to Karimova. As far back as 2004, an article for the Moscow Times had alleged that Karimova siphoned some $20m out of Uzdunrobita using fraudulent invoices. A former adviser had also accused Karimova of \"racketeering\".. Because it was a high-value transaction linked to a high-risk jurisdiction, Uzbekistan, the report argues that SH Landes should have conducted \"enhanced due diligence\" - thorough background checks to ensure the source of funds was legitimate and not derived from criminal activity.. SH Landes also submitted the 2012 financial statements for Panally Ltd. The report says in September 2013 they were signed off by a close associate of Karimova's: Gayane Avakyan, then aged 30.. The previous year, the BBC had .  that Avakyan was the registered beneficial owner of Takilant, a Gibraltar-registered company at the centre of \"a high-level multi-million dollar fraud and corruption scandal in Uzbekistan\". . In a statement to the BBC, Steven Landes said: \"SH Landes LLP was never engaged by Gulnara Karimova. SH Landes LLP did act on behalf of Rustam Madumarov.. \"SH Landes LLP obtained due diligence on all its clients and relevant regulatory authorities were notified and kept appraised.\". Tom Mayne of Freedom For Eurasia said the apparent ease with which Karimova managed to buy so much UK property was concerning.. \"It took the authorities until 2017 to do anything, years after other countries had already frozen bank accounts and properties that belonged to her,\" he added. .
