        "content": "It says the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. . Moscow has denied the allegations and labelled the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move - the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and can only exercise jurisdiction within its member countries - and Russia is not one of them.. However it could affect the president in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally.. , the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. When asked about the ICC's move, US President Joe Biden said \"well, I think it's justified\". He noted that the US is not signed up to the ICC, \"but I think it makes a very strong point\". Mr Putin \"clearly committed war crimes\", he said.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. In the past, she has spoken openly of efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian children taken to Russia. . Last September, Ms Lvova-Belova complained that some children removed from the city of Mariupol \"spoke badly about the [Russian President], said awful things and sang the Ukrainian anthem.\". She has also claimed to have adopted a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol.. The ICC said it initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public in the event that it stopped further crimes from being committed.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told the BBC: \"children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported\".. \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be human being to know how egregious it is,\" he said.. Reactions to the warrants came within minutes of the announcement, with Kremlin officials instantly dismissing them.. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. \"No need to explain WHERE this paper should be used,\" he wrote on Twitter, with a toilet paper emoji.. However Russian opposition leaders welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Khan and the criminal court for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the decision was \"historic for Ukraine\", while the country's presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, lauded the decision as \"only the beginning\".. This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. But because Russia is not a signed member of the ICC, there is very little chance that Vladimir Putin or Maria Lvova-Belova will appear in the dock at The Hague. . The ICC relies on the cooperation of governments to arrest people, and Russia is \"obviously not going to cooperate in this respect\", Jonathan Leader Maynard, a lecturer in international politics at King's College London, told the BBC.. However Mr Khan pointed out that no-one thought . , the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, would end up in The Hague.. \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" he said.. Legally, however, this does present Mr Putin with a problem. . While he is the head of a G20 state, and about to . , Mr Putin is now also a wanted man, and this will inevitably place restrictions on which countries he can visit.. There is also a level of embarrassment for the Kremlin, which has always denied allegations of Russian war crimes, that such an influential, pan-national body as the ICC simply does not believe its denials..

        "content": "Trading in cryptocurrencies has become popular, with people often promised large rewards over short periods.. But law enforcement agencies warn of a growing number of scams and recommend investors conduct \"due diligence\".. Roxana, not her real name, is from Romania. She says she lost hundreds of euros when she invested in iEarn Bot. She asked not to have her identity revealed as she fears her professional reputation might be damaged.. Customers buying the bots - like Roxana - were told their investment would be handled by the company's artificial intelligence programme, guaranteeing high returns.. \"I invested in a bot for one month,\" Roxana tells the BBC. \"You could see in the app how many dollars the app was creating: there were graphics showing how the investment was progressing. . \"It looked quite professional until, at some point, they announced maintenance.\" At that point, for some time, withdrawals from the app were frozen.. \"Some people started to say 'I cannot withdraw... what is happening',\" explains Roxana. \"I made the request to withdraw and the money just disappeared. The portfolio became zero - but I was never credited on my wallet with any money.\". In Romania, dozens of high-profile figures, including government officials and academics, were persuaded to invest via the app because it was sponsored by Gabriel Garais, a leading IT expert in the country. . Mr Garais says he too was fooled into investing his own savings in the app and lost his money.. But Roxana insists, had it not been for Garais's sponsorship, she would have never considered investing.. \"We had the knowledge to think this might be a scam,\" she says, \"but the fact that, in between us and the company there was a reputable teacher, meant that we didn't check too much - we didn't doubt too much.\". What happened in Romania is not an isolated incident. Nor is it unique to Romania. . When Silvia Tabusca, a Romanian organised crime expert from the European Center for Legal Education and Research, began looking into iEarn Bot, she discovered that many people in other countries had also lost their money in the scheme. . What surprised her most was the scale of the operation.. \"From what we have seen, the number of investors is quite high,\" she says. \"In Indonesia, for example, they [iEarn Bot] claim they had 800,000 customers.\" . \"At first the app works very well,\" says Ms Tabusca. . \"When they have enough investors and enough money invested in a specific country, they don't allow that country to withdraw any more - and they open other countries.\" . iEarn Bot presents itself as a US-based company with excellent credentials, but when the BBC fact-checked some information on its website, it raised some red flags.. The man whom the site names as the company's founder told us he had never heard of them. He said he has made a complaint to the police. . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, alongside companies such as Huawei and Qualcomm, are all named as \"strategic partners\" of iEarn Bot, but they too said they have no knowledge of the company and they are not working with it.. On the website, the company does not provide any contact information. When the BBC checked the history of its Facebook page, we learned that until the end of 2021, the account was advertising weight-loss products. It is managed from Vietnam and Cambodia.. iEarn Bot places a big emphasis on pushing investors to recruit more people to join the app. . \"The way people in this company operate is more similar to a Ponzi scheme, than an actual business,\" says Ms Tabusca.. The BBC has also seen chat conversations where people, who claim to be from iEarn Bot's customer service, told investors that in order to withdraw their money, they must pay a 30% fee. . \"Some people were quite desperate to get their money back, so they paid the fee - but they still couldn't withdraw,\" says Ms Tabusca.. The BBC has repeatedly approached iEarn Bot for comment but so far it has not responded.. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Colombia, local leaders were pushed by iEarn Bot mentors - with whom they only ever communicated on Telegram - to organise recruiting events.. Andres, from Colombia, said he actively recruited people to join the app. He still believes the company is legitimate.. \"They had their registration in the US that showed they were legit,\" he says. \"And they were paying.\". In his country, withdrawals were stopped in December. People were told the company was transforming investment in USDT - a well-established cryptocurrency - into a new coin called iBot, which had the same value. . Investors were asked to be patient until March, when the new coin was expected to be officially launched. But people are still waiting to access their money.. \"[People] took loans to invest. They used money from other sources, many people were affected,\" says Andres. \"As the local leaders did not have answers, people started to get angry.\". With the help of an analyst, the BBC managed to identify one main crypto wallet that received payments from about 13,000 potential victims, for a profit of almost $1.3m (£1m) in less than one year.. But we could not track down where and to whom the money went. . For investigators, this is a common issue.. \"One of the challenges is to identify and attribute who the illicit actor is, where the value is going, and then being able to take investigative steps and law enforcement action,\" says John Wyman, chief of the FBI's new Virtual Assets Unit.. Investigations in this sort of scheme, he says, go global quickly. . Such investigations require international co-operation and may take longer, but he insists that those responsible are eventually brought to justice.. The FBI set up the Virtual Assets Unit last year in order to respond to the growing number of crimes using virtual currencies. . It invites people who have been victims of scams to make a complaint on the FBI's dedicated page.. But law enforcement agencies maintain the best way to fight scammers remains prevention.. \"Knowledge - and doing some due diligence before the investment  - it's critical,\" says Mr Wyman. . \"It's like everything else: if it sounds too good to be true, it often is.\".

It is the second night of unrest since President Emmanuel Macron decided to push through the controversial reforms to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 . No-confidence motions have been filed against his government in response.. The first was signed by independents and members of the left-wing Nupes coalition in parliament, while a second came from the far-right National Rally party.. Both are expected to be debated early next week. . Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally MPs in parliament, called the decision to push through the pension changes \"a total failure for the government\".. Police made dozens of arrests during the unrest at Place de la Concorde, not far from the parliament building.. Protests also took place on Friday in other French cities - notably Bordeaux, Toulon and Strasbourg. . \"We won't give up,\" one demonstrator told AFP news agency. \"There's still hope that the reform can be revoked.\". Another told Reuters that pushing the legislation through without a vote was \"a denial of democracy... a total denial of what has been happening in the streets for several weeks\".. The government has said the changes to pensions are essential to ensure the system is not overburdened and prevent it collapsing. . But many people, including union members, disagree and France has now seen more than two months of heated political debate and strikes over the issue. . Transport, public services and schools have all been affected, while a rolling walkout by waste collectors has seen .  and there are plans to stop production at a large refinery in Normandy in the coming days. . \"Changing the government or prime minister will not put out this fire, only withdrawing the reform,\" said the head of the moderate CFDT union, Laurent Berger..
