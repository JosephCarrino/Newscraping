Russia claimed the .  about 10km (6.2 miles) from Bakhmut, in January following a long battle with the Ukrainian forces.. Soledar, too, was reportedly reduced to a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble by the time the Ukrainian army retreated..

According to prosecutors, Sizemore had been caught once before trying to use a similar device.. Two years later, he was sentenced to 16 months for violating the terms of his probation, and was also arrested for driving under the influence.. \"I was a guy who'd come from very little and risen to the top,\" Sizemore wrote in his 2013 autobiography.. \"I'd had the multimillion-dollar house, the Porsche, the restaurant I partially owned with Robert De Niro. And now I had absolutely nothing.\". \"I've led an interesting life,\" he wrote. \"But I can't tell you what I'd give to be the guy you didn't know anything about.\".
