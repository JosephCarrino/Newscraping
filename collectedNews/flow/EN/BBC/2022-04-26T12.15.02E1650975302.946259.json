        "content": "Swedish outlet Aftonbladet added that the US and UK have agreed to provide security support during the application process, citing government officials. . Stockholm and Helsinki have long pursued policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. . But during a visit to Sweden earlier this month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said \"everything had changed\" when Russia attacked Ukraine and told reporters that Helsinki must to be \"prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia\". . Her comments coincided with the .  Finland's membership of Nato could result in \"increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia\". . The Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that the announcement of the simultaneous bid could come during a state visit by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto to Stockholm next month. . Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman .  with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead.. And there have been some reports that Russia had started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that.. US defence sources told Aftonbladet that Sweden and Finland would be treated as de-facto members of the security alliance for the duration of the application process. . The UK and US support would reportedly include an increased number of troops in the Nordic nations, further intelligence co-operation, assistance in combatting cyber threats and an increased presence of Nato warships in the Baltic sea.. Last week Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said a wide-ranging security review being carried out by Stockholm will be completed by 13 May, rather than 31 May as initially planned. . She noted that with Finland's analysis now complete \"there is now a lot of pressure\" to urgently publish the report, and her party, the Social Democrats, are expected to drop their traditional opposition to joining the bloc. . Russia sees Nato as a threat to its security, and before the war in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the bloc removed its forces from Eastern European member states. . However, Russia's invasion has had the opposite effect, with Nato bolstering its forces in Eastern Europe and traditionally neutral countries now on the verge of joining the bloc. . Public sentiment in both Sweden and Finland towards Nato membership has changed dramatically since Russia launched its invasion over two months ago. . In Finland, opinion polls show that public support for joining bloc has climbed from 28% in February to 68% last month.. Meanwhile, 57% of Swedes now favour NATO membership, up from 51% in March..

        "content": "Nina Malenok's home is just by the side of a road that Russian troops used as they began their invasion of Ukraine, on their way to the northern city of Chernihiv, and the capital Kyiv. . Wedged into the yard of Nina's home is the tail of a rocket fired in the early hours of the 24 February - the day the war started. . \"I heard it land in my yard. There was fire and smoke everywhere. My lights went off. I jumped out of bed and ran out my house,\" said Nina.. In the days that followed, hidden in a cellar, she heard planes flying overhead, heavy vehicles driving in and whistles being frequently blown.. On 8 March, Russian TV journalists came to her home accompanied by Russian soldiers. . \"They were filming everything here, all the shells and everything. They told me Ukraine was attacking itself. Then they sent the numbers [printed] on the rocket to someone in Russia, and received a response right away that it was one of theirs.\". Many such rockets are scattered all over the village. Experts who've seen images of the rockets have told the BBC that they could have been carrying cluster bombs, banned in other parts of the world for the devastation they cause. Both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of using them. . Even after the withdrawal, Nina does not feel safe. . \"It's scary to live like this, but I'm used to my house, Where will I go? I can hear the shelling. I can show you from my yard the Russian checkpoint,\" she said.. Her home, and others in the village are visible from Russia. Its troops can see what they have been firing at.. For Lidiya Bilousova, it's the second time in her life she saw tanks at her doorstep.. Born in 1930, she vividly remembers World War Two and German soldiers coming into their village. . 'We'd been warned by our retreating soldiers that they would be coming. So we hid in the trenches with dry bread in cloth bags. At dawn, they were in our streets, with their horses and machinery, crossing our gardens with machine guns. But there was no mass shelling like there is now,\" she said. \"Back in the day, I could run away. Now I'm old. I can't anymore.\". \"Here's what I'll tell you, there is nothing good about war,\" Lidiya said. \"After the last war [World War Two] what were we left with?\". The shelling frightens her, but she is unwilling to leave the home she's lived in for most of her life. . Prior to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, the three-way border crossing would be opened and a unity festival would be celebrated at the point where the countries meet, where a monument dedicated to the friendship between them called \"Three Sisters\" still stands. . 'It was a beautiful festival. We, the Russians, the Belarusians would celebrate together. People from all over, important dignitaries would all come,\" she said. . Lidiya's late husband was Belarusian. . \"The three countries were friends for years, we visited each other, married each other. Now it's over.\". Families and friendships spread across borders have been divided, both in thought and in distance. After 2014, crossing the border became harder for people on all sides. Now, it's impossible.. Mykhaylo Dudko's two brothers, a sister, nephews and nieces live in Russia. He hasn't met his family in years. Now, he's unable to understand them.. \"My sister told me it was us who started the war. But we had no such intention.  It was Russia which invaded us. I want my family to use their heads, to look at the situation independently,\" he said. . Nina Malenok said she's stopped talking to her brother who lives in Belarus.. \"He says it's America who attacked you, and you blame Russia. He's just five miles away across the border, and he doesn't believe what's really happening,\" she said. \" I want to cross him out of my life because of that.\"  .

        "content": "Many Twitter users are also asking whether this means accounts suspended by the company will be allowed back.. The most high-profile person to have been suspended was Donald Trump.. After the news of the deal was announced, human rights groups raised concerns about hate speech on Twitter and the power it would give Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\".. He has been vocal in his criticism of the platform's policies on moderating content, arguing that Twitter needs to be a genuine forum for free speech.. In a statement after striking the deal he described free speech as \"the bedrock of a functioning democracy\".. In a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\". Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.. Donald Trump's account was terminated permanently last year in the wake of the 6 January riots at the Capitol building in Washington.. But even if his Twitter ban is reversed, Mr Trump says he does not plan to return to Twitter, instead opting to use his own platform, Truth Social. . \"I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,\" Mr Trump told Fox News. . He added that he believed Mr Musk, who he called a \"good man\", will \"make improvements\" to the platform. . Representatives of Mr Trump did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. Ming-Chi Kuo, a technology analyst at investment management firm TF International Securities, told the BBC that Mr Trump may decide to return to the platform if he runs in the 2024 US presidential election.. \"Twitter is still a better choice for him to have a voice, if Twitter is willing to restore his account,\" Mr Kuo said. . \"It's not easy to build a platform with more influence than Twitter before the next presidential election.\". Mr Musk said that he hopes that even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". . However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". . \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers.. Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". . \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added.. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". . \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said.  . The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer. . Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and still sits on its board, said he was happy the platform \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", even though he does not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\".. \"It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company,\" Mr Dorsey said in a tweet on Tuesday.. \"Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust,\" Mr Dorsey added. \"I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.\". Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain, according to the Reuters news agency.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. . On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", whoever owns or runs Twitter.. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\".. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as \"an encouraging day for freedom of speech\". . This video can not be played.
