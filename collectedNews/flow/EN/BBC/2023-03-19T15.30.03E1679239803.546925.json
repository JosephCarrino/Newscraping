        "content": "Watch: Putin takes a drive around occupied Mariupol. An official video shows Mr Putin driving a car through streets at night and speaking to people. The Kremlin says it happened late on Saturday.. It is believed to be his first trip to a newly-occupied Ukrainian territory. . Mariupol's exiled mayor told BBC News that Mr Putin was a \"criminal\" who had \"returned to the scene of the crime\".. \"He has come in person to see what he has done,\" Vadym Boychenko said. \"He's come to see what he will be punished for.\". Other exiled Ukrainian city officials said Mr Putin had visited at night so he would not see the destroyed city in daylight.. Tass news agency says he travelled to Mariupol by helicopter. In the video he is in the car with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, who explains how the city is being rebuilt. . The Kremlin has said the decision to drive round the city was made spontaneously by the Russian leader.. Putin also appears to visit the Philharmonic Hall, which was used to stage trials of defenders of the Azovstal iron and steel plant, a huge industrial complex where Ukrainian troops held out before eventually surrendering.. The Russian leader is also reported to have met top military commanders in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city just east of Mariupol.. Mariupol has been under Russian occupation for more than 10 months after being . . Ukraine says more than 20,000 people were killed there..

The purpose is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia's own. Russian authorities say 300,000 people are now living there.. The fighting saw Russia strike a Mariupol theatre where hundreds of civilians were sheltering. The building collapsed, and at least 300 are believed to have died there.. Ukraine and human rights groups say the attack amounted to a war crime. . It is among incidents for which Mr Putin and his regime could be held legally responsible, the United Nations has said.. The International Criminal Court said on Friday it had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Putin over  involving the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. It means he could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states.. On Saturday Mr Putin made an unannounced visit to Crimea, to mark the ninth anniversary of Russia's annexation of the territory from Ukraine. . He visited a new Russian arts school, a children's summer camp and future cultural projects, such as the New Russia museum and museum of Christianity, Russian state media reported.. The Kyiv authorities have vowed to liberate all Russian-occupied territories, including Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . ",

        "content": "The anger and mutual incomprehension over President Emmanuel Macron's proposed reform of the pension age show how dangerously polarised the two factions have become.. The government says pushing back the pension age from 62 to 64 is vital in order to preserve France's much-prized \"share-out\" system - based on a single fund that workers pay into and pensioners draw out of.. With people living longer, the only alternatives would be to cut the value of pensions, or increase contributions from those in work.  . And both those options would be even more unpopular.. What's more, says the president, France is merely aligning itself with every other European democracy - most of which have pension ages even higher than the proposed 64.. But none of this seems to have gained traction with the public, who continue to reject the reform by a margin of about 70% to 30%.. Instead, people seem more inclined to believe the arguments of the left and far-right: first that there is no urgency because pension finances are not as bad as they're portrayed - but also that it's unjust.. On one side, many protesters are calling not just for an end to the reform, but actually for a lowering of the retirement age, back to where it was before 2010, when it was just 60.. On the other, voices from the right say that the Macron plan is already so riddled with concessions and exemptions, wrung under pressure during the long parliamentary process, that the savings it will make are now virtually meaningless.. In a functioning democracy the opposing arguments would surely find some form of compromise. After all, a majority of the population, while rejecting the Macron plan, also agrees that some reform of pensions is needed.. But is French democracy functioning? . Faith in conventional politics and the parliamentary system is in fact at rock-bottom. How else to explain the collapse of Gaullists and Socialists, who ran France for half a century, and the rise of the far-right and far-left?. President Macron encouraged the death of the . , that old order which he exploited to pose as the lone moderate, picking sensible bits from programmes of left and right.. Hyper-intelligent and hyper-keen he may have been, but France never liked him and he was elected, twice, by default. Because the alternative, Marine Le Pen, was unacceptable to most. . By eliminating the moderate opposition, he made the opposition extreme.. At last year's parliamentary election, he failed to secure a majority - making inevitable the use last Thursday of constitutional.  known as 49:3 to push the law through.. Meanwhile, the tenor of public debate was steadily debased. . The left tabled literally thousands of amendments to the pensions bill, making its conventional passage impossible. Opponents described as \"brutal\" and \"inhuman\" a reform which in other countries would have seemed perfectly anodyne.. One left-wing MP posed outside the Assembly with his foot on a ball painted with the head of the labour minister; fearing mob violence, a leading pro-Macron MP called on Friday for police protection for her colleagues.. With scenes of looting and urban violence, hills of rotting rubbish on the streets of Paris and other French cities, and the promise of more crippling strikes to come, this is the unedifying atmosphere as the country enters the next crucial phase in the crisis.. Following the president's invocation of the 49:3 procedure, opposition parties have tabled two censure motions against the government which will be debated this week. In theory, if one of them passes that would lead to the fall of the government, and possible early elections.. In practice, even the so-called \"transpartisan\" motion tabled by a centrist group in parliament - supposedly more liable to create a consensus between the mutually hostile far-left and far-right - would be unlikely to get the numbers.. If the motions fail, then the opposition can continue to battle the reform by other means: for example by appealing to the Constitutional Council, which rules on the constitutionality of new laws, or by trying to organise a referendum.. The government hopes that reality will at some point set in, and that most people will dejectedly accept the inevitable. . Quite possibly a sacrificial victim will eventually have to made - no doubt in the form of Prime Minister Ã‰lisabeth Borne.. But for now, the mood is too ugly for that.  . In the immediate term, to every petrol depot blockaded, to every bin uncollected, and to every window smashed will be joined the accompanying refrain: \"Blame 49:3. Blame Macron.\". ",

The poll comes three weeks after a contentious presidential election which the opposition allege was rigged in favour of the winner Bola Tinubu. .

Similar attacks were also reported in Sokoto state in the north-west, Kano in the north, and Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta.. The situation is calmer on Sunday in areas where the election was postponed to a second day..

        "content": "According to the Financial Times UBS is offering to pay up to $1bn (Â£820m) for Credit Suisse.. Regulators are trying to facilitate a deal before markets reopen on Monday.. The trouble at Credit Suisse, combined with the failure of two smaller US banks during the last two weeks, have thrown the health of the global financial system into doubt.. Credit Suisse is one of around 30 banks worldwide deemed too big to fail because they are of such importance to the banking system.. But the 167-year-old institution is loss-making and has faced a string of problems in recent years, including money laundering charges.. An emergency $54bn (Â£44.5bn) lifeline from the Swiss National Bank on Wednesday failed to reassure markets and Credit Suisse shares tumbled 24%, prompting a wider sell-off on European markets.. A deal could be signed as soon as Sunday evening, according to the FT, which first reported that regulators and the Swiss National Bank were facilitating talks between the two Swiss banking giants.. The deal currently believed to be on the table would value Credit Suisse shares at less than a seventh of the price they were on Friday. However the FT said terms could change and a deal had not yet been reached.. UBS shareholders would normally have six weeks to consider a deal on this scale, but the FT says the Swiss authorities are planning to change the country's laws to bypass a shareholder vote on the transaction.. Bank of England officials have confirmed they are in close contact with their counterparts at the Swiss National Bank while regulators and management discuss Credit Suisse's future. The UK Treasury is also monitoring the situation.. The deal would amount to a significant intervention from the Swiss authorities, said Mohammed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to German financial services firm Allianz.. \"This is not a voluntary action, this is a shotgun wedding and it's being done in order to restore financial stability,\" Mr El-Erian told the BBC. \"Without it Credit Suisse may end up in a death spiral, in which it finds it much harder to undertake its banking activities.. \"That could raise questions about other banks at a time when there are also banking concerns in the United States.\". Mr El-Erian said the current turmoil could lead to banks becoming more \"risk averse\", leading to a fall in credit availability. . But that amounted to a \"headwind\" for the global economy, rather than something like the sudden stop experienced during the 2008 financial crisis, which was \"in a completely different league\" to today's problems, he said.. UBS is said to have asked the Swiss government to cover about $6bn (Â£4.9bn) in costs if it were to buy Credit Suisse, according to sources quoted by Reuters.  . Credit Suisse reported a loss of 7.3bn Swiss francs ($7.9bn; Â£6.5bn) in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024.. UBS, however, made a profit of $7.6bn in 2022.. Any deal may also result in significant job losses. . As well as being a domestic bank with 95 branches, Credit Suisse has a global investment banking operation and manages the assets of rich clients. . At the end of last year Credit Suisse had a global staff of 50,480, including 16,700 in Switzerland, though 9,000 jobs were to be axed, the Swiss broadcaster SRF reports.. ",

        "content": "For Maria Silvia and Francesca - and their four children Margherita, twins Giorgio and Raffaele, and Antonio - being finally recognised as a household after years of legal challenges and discrimination was \"truly incredible\".. This week, however, what was then seen as a major victory for equality and acceptance by the LGBT community was reversed.. Italy's right-wing government instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents, reigniting a debate around Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative agenda.. Hundreds of people protested against the government ban in Milan on Saturday.. The newly elected leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, was among them. She said her message to the prime minister was \"not to discriminate against the daughters and sons of these wonderful families\". . \"We are talking about boys and girls already growing up in our communities and going to our schools,\" Ms Schlein said. \"It is no longer tolerable, and these families are tired of being discriminated against.''. Ms Meloni, who leads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, made anti-LGBT rhetoric a cornerstone of her electoral campaign, promising to protect traditional values. . \"We were always a family, but being officially recognised as such by our own mayor made us feel welcome,\" said Maria Silvia Fiengo. \"Today, looking at what the government is doing, and knowing that other families won't be able to have the same opportunity, we feel discouraged.\" . Italy legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 under a centre-left government.. However, stiff resistance from Catholic and conservative groups meant that the law stopped short of granting adoption rights to same-sex couples as well. Opponents said it would encourage surrogate pregnancies, which are still illegal in Italy. . That left a regulatory vacuum surrounding several aspects of LGBT family life, including adoption. Solutions aimed at getting around bureaucratic hurdles were reached on a case-by-case basis, as cases went to court.. Some local administrators, including the centre-left mayor of Milan, decided that children of same-sex couples would be registered independently.  . Mr Sala has now announced he has been forced to halt the practice after he was sent a letter by the interior ministry. It cited a ruling by Italy's highest court requiring court approval for legal recognition of parental status. . \"It is a clear step backwards, politically and socially, and I put myself in the shoes of those parents who thought they could count on this possibility in Milan,\" said the mayor in his daily podcast Buongiorno Milano, adding that he was left with no other choice.. Children who are denied the right to have both parents recognised on their birth certificate are left in a legal limbo.. Their families face a range of challenges. In the most extreme scenario, if the legally recognised parent were to pass away, the children could become wards of the state and face the prospect of being orphaned. . In Italy's LGBT community, this has led to a growing sense of frustration and anxiety, while the Meloni government's hostile approach to LGBT rights has further exacerbated the issue.. \"Children end up having limited access to key services and benefits, such as healthcare, inheritance and child support,\" said Angelo Schillaci, law professor at Sapienza University in Rome. . \"At present, only one parent is recognised by law, the other one is a ghost. In real life, parents and children play together, cook together, play sports and go on holiday together. But on paper, they are apart, the state does not see them. It's a paradoxical situation.\" . The prime minister, elected last September, has been a vocal supporter of traditional family and Christian values, campaigning against what she calls \"gender ideology\" and the \"LGBT lobby\". Months before she came to power, she proposed a law that would make surrogacy by an Italian citizen a universal crime, and it is still on her party's agenda. . \"Boys and girls with two mothers and two fathers already exist in Italy, Prime Minister Meloni should get over it,\" said Alessia Crocini, president of the Rainbow Families association. \"We must guarantee our children the same rights as their peers.\" . \"We feel under attack,\" said Angela Diomede, who was planning to take part in the Milan rally with her wife and their six-year-old girl. \"I don't understand this obsession of the government with targeting children, it doesn't lead anywhere.\" . Italy's Senate this week also rejected a proposal for a standardised European parenthood certificate that would be recognised across all 27 member states of the EU.. For children, it would mean proof of parenthood and for parents it would be a guaranteed right to be recognised across the EU, protecting rights such as inheritance and citizenship. . But for Italy's far-right infrastructure minister, Matteo Salvini, it was a step too far. \"A person can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual: love is free, beautiful and sacred for all,\" he tweeted.. Riccardo Magi, an opposition MP in favour of the Europe-wide certificate, complained: \"The world goes one way, the [Italian] government goes the other.\" . The debate is being followed closely from the north-eastern city of Udine by Stefano Zucchini and his husband Alberto.. They have two six-year-old twins, who were born in California through surrogacy, and hope to be legally recognised as a family one day. In the US, they are both recognised as parents. But in Italy, Stefano is listed as a single father, and that legal status makes life complicated.. \"Even things that are normal for most people, such as driving the kids to the kindergarten or to a doctor appointment, can become a challenge,\" he told the BBC.. \"They don't see us, but our love is as strong as ever. That, for sure, exists.\". ",
