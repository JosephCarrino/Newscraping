        "content": "Saturday's voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, as well as scattered reports of ballot box snatching and attacks by armed men. . And some parties have raised alarm over allegations of irregularities, which could lead to a disputed outcome.. The elections are the biggest democratic exercise in Africa, with 87 million people eligible to vote.. Politics has been dominated by two parties - the ruling APC and the PDP - since the restoration of multi-party democracy 24 years ago.. But this time, there is also a strong challenge from a third-party candidate in the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari - from the Labour Party's Peter Obi, who is backed by many young people.. Tens of thousands of polling stations are counting the results, which will be collated and sent to the electoral headquarters in the capital Abuja.. The final result is not expected until at least Tuesday.. At a press briefing on Saturday, the electoral chief, Mahmood Yakubu, apologised for the delays in voting, but he said that everyone who was in a queue by 14:30 local time (13:30 GMT) would be allowed to cast their ballots, even though polling stations were officially supposed to close by then.. Voters in the biggest city, Lagos, cheered as electoral officers arrived at a polling station in the suburb of Lekki nearly four hours after polls had officially closed.. \"As a Nigerian you expect any eventuality, so I came out with my power bank and a bottle of water. I will wait till they arrive so I can vote,\" first-time voter Edith told the BBC.. There have been reports from Lagos of violence and ballot boxes being snatched. Some voters complained of being attacked and chased out of where they had gathered to cast their ballots.. In other places, people reported being asked to either vote for a particular candidate or leave the polling centre.. Mr Yakubu said that armed men had attacked some polling units in the southern state of Delta and the northern state of Katsina, where voter card verification machines were carted away.. They were subsequently replaced and security boosted to allow voting to take place, he added.. But voting was postponed to Sunday at 141 polling stations in the oil-rich southern state of Bayelsa because of disruptions.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. The lead-up to the polls was overshadowed by a cash shortage caused by a botched attempt to redesign the currency, leading to widespread chaos at banks and cash machines as desperate people sought access to their money.. The new notes were introduced in order to tackle inflation, and also vote-buying. On the eve of the election a member of the House of Representatives was arrested with almost $500,000 (£419,000) in cash, and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say.. Whoever wins will have to deal with the currency redesign, a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives, with another vote for state governors in March.. The election has seen a huge interest from young people - a third of eligible voters are below 35.. Mr Obi, 61, is hoping to break up Nigeria's two-party system after joining the Labour Party last May.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the south.. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted as he is unlikely to win.. Instead, the PDP, which ruled until 2015, wants Nigerians to vote for Atiku Abubakar, 76 - the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north.. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Bola Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. ",

Penny Wong, the first openly gay female in Australia's parliament, also took part in the celebrations. . The presence of the prime minister, who has marched in the parade in the past as an MP, was greeted with cheers but his critics have accused him of pandering to a minority that's hijacking Australia's social agenda.. Opposition MP, Barnaby Joyce, criticised Mr Albanese for attending a party instead of dealing with a crime crisis in Alice Springs - a remote town in Australia's Northern Territory. . Mr Albanese wasn't the only politician to attend Mardi Gras - members of other parties, including the Greens and Liberals, also came to show their support. . It's not the first time an Australian prime minister has attended the event - Malcolm Turnbull was present in 2016 but did not march. . The Mardi Gras parade has been running since 1978 and grew out of a protest marking the anniversary of .  - an uprising by members of the LGBT community in New York more than 50 years ago. . For the past two years the parade has been held as a seated event at the Sydney Cricket Ground due to the pandemic. . This year's event coincides in Sydney with WorldPride, which promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally. . Other world leaders who have taken part in pride parades in the past include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern. . ",

For decades, the goliath frog has been over-hunted for food and the pet trade in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. . Its habitat beside rivers and streams is fast being destroyed and the frog is now classified as endangered on the official extinction Red List.. The frog is little-known to science and even in Cameroon many local people are unaware of its value to the ecosystem, such as preying on the insects that damage crops.. The conservation team works to persuade hunters to become citizen scientists, recording sightings of the frog rather than using it for food.. They are also working with local groups to help set up snail farming to provide an alternative food source.. The conservation work is starting to pay off, with the goliath frog returning to new rivers in the Mount Nlonako Reserve.. A call from a former poacher to report a frog had been captured by a neighbour was a turning point. Cedric was able to rescue the frog and return it to the wild.. \"I believe we can have it forever and we can continue to be proud of it,\" he says..

        "content": "He is one of at least four journalists being investigated for reporting or commenting on the earthquake.. Press freedom groups say dozens more have been detained, harassed or prevented from reporting.. At least 50,000 people were killed when earthquakes hit both Turkey and Syria. . Turkey's authorities have not commented on the detentions.. On the night of the earthquake, Mr Koçer - who is Kurdish and contributes to pro-opposition news sites such as Bianet and Duvar - was smoking on his balcony in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, when his two dogs suddenly started barking. . He later remembered how they had barked just like that in 2020, seconds before a smaller earthquake hit eastern Turkey.. \"I felt I was shaking. I felt the house shaking, I felt the TV shaking,\" says Mr Koçer. He hid under a dinner table with the dogs and then rushed outside.. Mr Koçer left Diyarbakir and drove to the city of Gaziantep. He was shocked by scenes of destruction and victims enduing freezing temperatures in towns near the very epicentre of the quake.. At least 3,000 of the earthquake's victims died in Gaziantep. . \"When holding the microphone, behind the camera or in front of the camera, I could not hold back my tears,\" Mr Koçer recalls.. Mr Koçer was touched by the influx of volunteers and rescue teams coming from Western Turkey, and he shared their stories on Twitter. Some of the survivors told him they received no aid for days. Similar complaints were cited across pro-opposition media outlets. . Visiting the earthquake-affected areas, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the people he would rebuild their cities. But he also warned that those spreading \"fake news\" and \"causing social chaos\" would be prosecuted, calling them \"provocateurs\".. Mr Koçer says that while he was reporting from the region hit by the earthquake, Diyarbakir police left a note at his apartment, instructing him to visit the police station and give a statement.. At the station, he was told that he was being investigated under a recently introduced disinformation law. He said the police questioned him about his reporting from the earthquake epicentre and accused him of spreading false information. . Turkey's new law was adopted in October. It criminalised the public spreading of disinformation and gave the state much broader powers to control news sites and social media. . The Venice Commission, a legal watchdog of the Council of Europe, said the law would interfere with freedom of expression. . Opposition parties call it a \"censorship law\".. Mr Koçer insists that he was meticulous in his work and interviewed all sides, from survivors to the police, the gendarmerie and rescue workers. \"I did not share information without thorough research and analysis,\" he says.. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called the investigation against Mr Koçer \"absurd\" and urged the authorities to drop it. . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an advocacy group, at least three more journalists are facing criminal charges.. Merdan Yanardağ and Enver Aysever are prominent Istanbul-based political commentators with large social media followings. Both have criticised the government's rescue efforts. They're both under investigation along with Mehmet Güleş, who, like Mr Koçer, is based in Diyarbakir. He was detained on suspicion of \"inciting hatred\" for interviewing a volunteer critical of the government's rescue effort and later released, according to RSF.. The number of other journalists under investigation is unclear. On Tuesday, the police said they detained 134 people over \"provocative posts\" and arrested 25 of them, but their identities have not been disclosed. Some of those detained may well have been spreading falsehoods, including one that Afghan migrants had been scavenging in ruined neighbourhoods.. But critics say the clampdown has gone far beyond those spreading harmful disinformation. . \"The government is trying to suppress information coming from the quake zone,\" says cyber rights expert Yaman Akdeniz who teaches at the Istanbul Bilgi University. . The arrests came after Turkey's presidential communications director warned against \"lethal disinformation\" jeopardising the rescue efforts. The directorate also rolled out a smartphone app called \"Disinformation Reporting Service\" encouraging people to report manipulative posts about the quake. . \"Any time [Turkish] officials and the government are being criticised, they don't like it,\" says Arzu Geybulla, a journalist in Istanbul covering digital authoritarianism and censorship.. \"But this time they are perhaps more vocal.\". The BBC contacted Turkey's presidential directorate for communications asking about the journalists investigated and the calls by advocacy groups to drop investigations, but has had no response. . ",

It comes after China this week published a plan to end the conflict that was viewed by some as pro-Russian. . India, which hosted this week's G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging \"chair's summary\" from the meeting, noting there were \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.. A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were \"agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China\". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration in November, and criticised \"in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine\".. After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, . China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia's invasion.. The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: \"[President] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?\". After the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because \"their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues\". . \"On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy\" and needed to be mentioned, he added. . The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.. Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that \"the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way\". . It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of \"clear blackmail\", urging them to \"acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world\". .
