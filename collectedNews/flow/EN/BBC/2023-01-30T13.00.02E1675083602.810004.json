Most of those who died were part of the police force, and it is believed they were the target of the attack. . Early reports said a bomber sitting in the front row had blown himself up, but this has not been confirmed and no group has admitted the bombing.. Muhammad Ijaz Khan, Peshawar capital city police officer, told local media that between 300 and 400 police officials were present in the area at the time of the blast.. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has strongly condemned it. In a statement, Mr Sharif said those behind the incident \"have nothing to do with Islam\".. He added: \"The entire nation is standing united against the menace of terrorism.\". The blast took place during afternoon prayers in the north-western city, around 13:30 (08:30 GMT), near the country's border with Afghanistan.. A video circulating social media and verified by the BBC shows that half of a wall has caved in. The mosque is covered in bricks and debris as people clamber over the rubble to escape.. A rescue operation is continuing inside the mosque and \"more bodies are being taken out,\" Peshawar city Deputy Commissioner Shafiullah Khan said.. \"Currently our priority is to save people buried under the debris,\" Mr Khan added.. Mohammad Asim, a spokesman for the Lady Reading Hospital, said that some of those injured were in a critical condition.. \"It's an emergency situation,\" Mr Asim added..

        "content": "The capsule contains a small quantity of radioactive Caesium-137, which could cause serious illness to anyone who comes into contact with it.. That could include skin damage, burns or radiation sickness. . Emergency services are searching along for the device using radiation detectors and other specialised equipment.. But Australia's Department for Fire and Emergency Services said the silver capsule - which is just 6mm (0.24 inches) in diameter and 8mm long - was so small it might have become lodged in the tyre of a vehicle passing along the road.. It may have gone missing up to two weeks ago.. Rio Tinto, which has big mining operations in Australia and has been the subject of a series of controversies in recent years, said it was sorry for the alarm that had been caused.. The firm would be launching its own investigation into what happened, it said in a statement.. The capsule, which was being transported by a subcontracted company, was picked up at Rio Tinto's Gudai-Darri mine site, in the remote Kimberley region on 12 January and was being taken to a storage facility in the north-east suburbs of Perth. That is roughly equivalent to the distance between John O'Groats in Scotland to Land's End in Cornwall. . When it was unpacked for inspection on 25 January the gauge was found broken apart and the radioactive capsule was gone. One of four mounting bolts and screws were also missing.. The authorities said vibrations during transit may have caused the bolts to become loose, allowing the capsule to fall through gaps in the casing and truck.. \"As part of this investigation we are working closely with the contractor to better understand what went wrong in this instance,\" said Simon Trott, chief executive of Rio Tinto's iron ore division.. The lost device is part of a density gauge which is commonly used in the mining industry. It was being used at the Gudai-Darri mine to measure the density of iron ore feed.. \"Rio Tinto engaged a third-party contractor, with appropriate expertise and certification, to safely package the device in preparation for transport off-site ahead of receipt at their facility in Perth. Prior to the device leaving the site, a Geiger counter [a device to detect radioactivity] was used to confirm the presence of the capsule inside the package,\" said Mr Trott.. State officials have issued a radiation alert across a vast swathe of Western Australia as the search for the capsule continues.. Exposure to trace quantities of the metal is like \"receiving 10 X-rays in an hour, just to put it in context, and... the amount of natural radiation we would receive in a year, just by walking around,\"Â said Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew Robertson.. The state's desert is remote and one of the least populated places in the country. Only one in five of Western Australia's population lives outside of Perth, the state's capital. . However, officials say they are concerned that someone could pick up the capsule, not knowing what it is.. \"If you have contact or have it close to you, you could either end up with skin damage, including skin burns... and if you have it long enough near you, you could cause what is called acute radiation sickness, and that will take a period of time,\" Mr Robertson added.. This incident comes as Rio Tinto tries to repair its reputation in Australia after it was hit by a . In 2020, Rio Tinto blasted the 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge to expand an iron ore mine, sparking a major outcry that led to several of the company's top bosses standing down.. Last year, .  at Australia's mining firms, after an internal review at Rio Tinto found more than 20 women had reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over five years..

        "content": "Watch: Johnson says Putin threatened him in phone call before Ukraine invasion. The then-prime minister said Mr Putin told him it \"would only take a minute\".. Mr Johnson said the comment was made after he warned the war would be an \"utter catastrophe\".. The claim is made in a BBC documentary on Mr Putin's interactions with world leaders over the years. The Kremlin spokesman said it was a \"lie\"..  Mr Johnson warned Mr Putin that invading Ukraine would lead to Western sanctions and more Nato troops on Russia's borders. . He also tried to deter Russian military action by telling Mr Putin that Ukraine would not join Nato \"for the foreseeable future\". . But Mr Johnson said: \"He threatened me at one point, and he said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute' or something like that. Jolly. . \"But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.\". President Putin had been \"very familiar\" during the \"most extraordinary call\", Mr Johnson said.  . No reference to the exchange appeared in accounts released to the media of the call given by both Downing Street and the Kremlin. . From the 2014 seizure of Crimea to the invasion of Ukraine, this is the inside story of a decade of clashes - as told by the Western leaders who traded blows with Putin's Russia.. It is impossible to know if Mr Putin's threat was genuine.  . However, given previous Russian attacks on the UK - most recently in Salisbury in 2018 - any threat from the Russian leader, however lightly delivered, is probably one Mr Johnson would have had no choice but to take seriously. . In his response, Mr Putin's spokesman said the former prime minister's claim was \"either a deliberate falsehood, in which case you need to ask Mr Johnson why he lied, or it was not a deliberate lie. That is, he didn't understand what President Putin was saying to him\".. \"There were no threats to use missiles,\" Dmitry Peskov told the BBC. . The Kremlin leader, he said, had simply pointed out that \"if Ukraine joined Nato the potential deployment of Nato or US missiles near Russia's border would mean that any missile could reach Moscow within minutes\".. Since the invasion, President Putin has warned countries that may try to interfere, that Russia's response would be immediate - even hinting at the use of nuclear weapons.. Nine days after Mr Johnson's conversation with President Putin, on 11 February, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Moscow to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu.. The BBC documentary Putin Vs the West reveals Mr Wallace left with assurances that Russia would not invade Ukraine, but he said both sides knew it was a lie. . He described it as a \"demonstration of bullying or strength, which is: I'm going to lie to you, you know I'm lying and I know you know I'm lying and I'm still going to lie to you.. \"I think it was about saying 'I'm powerful',\" Mr Wallace said. . He said the \"fairly chilling, but direct lie\" had confirmed his belief that Russia would invade. . As he left the meeting, he said Gen Valery Gerasimov - Russia's chief of general staff - told him \"never again will we be humiliated\".. Another significant encounter in the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine was with CIA director William Burns, who landed in Moscow on 2 November 2021.. Mr Burns had been circling the Russian capital for hours, as heavy fog prevented his landing, but when he finally arrived at the Kremlin he discovered Mr Putin was not there. Instead, he was sheltering in the southern Russian city of Sochi amid a spike in Covid infections.. The pair spoke over the phone.. The CIA director said he was direct in laying out the message President Biden had sent him to deliver: the US knew what Mr Putin was up to and he would pay a heavy price if he launched such an invasion.. He said the Russian president did not deny planning was underway and listed grievances about Ukraine and the West.. \"I was troubled before I arrived in Moscow. And I was even more troubled after I left,\" Mr Burns added.. Less than a fortnight after the UK defence secretary left Moscow, as tanks rolled over the border on 24 February, Mr Johnson received a phone call in the middle of the night from President Zelensky.. \"Zelensky's very, very calm,\" Mr Johnson recalled. \"But, he tells me, you know, they're attacking everywhere.\". Mr Johnson says he offered to help move the president to safety. . \"He doesn't take me up on that offer. He heroically stayed where he was.\". ",

        "content": "About 350 people needed emergency accommodation, New Zealand's prime minister Chris Hipkins said.. He added there had been significant damage across Auckland and the north island.. The newly appointed PM also highlighted climate change's role in the extreme weather event.. \"It's a 1-in-100-year weather event, and we seem to be getting a lot of them at the moment. I think people can see that there's a message in that...Climate change is real, it's with us,\" Mr Hipkins said on Monday.. He told national broadcaster TVNZ: \"We are going to have to deal with more of these extreme weather events in the future. . \"We need to be prepared for that. And we need to do everything we can to combat the challenge of climate change,\" he added.. Mr Hipkins also acknowledged criticism from locals that communications over the floods had been \"too few and far between\". . With the unprecedented rainfall Auckland has seen since Friday, even \"ordinary\" torrential rain in the days ahead could cause more flooding and damage than it would usually, the city's mayor said in a tweet on Monday.. \"In parts of the city, the weather looks a bit better - but, don't be fooled, our region is not out of the woods yet,\" Wayne Brown said.. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change increase the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, the country's climate science body, said Friday was the wettest day on record for a number of locations in Auckland. . Footage and images online showed people trapped in waist-deep floodwater, rescuers carrying out evacuations on kayaks and grocery items floating down the aisles of several flooded supermarkets. . Auckland Airport, which was temporarily closed due to damage from heavy flooding, has since reopened.. New Zealand media have identified two individuals who died in the floods. Daniel Newth, a 25-year-old arborist, died while kayaking near his North Shore home, and Daniel Mark Miller, 34, was found dead in a culvert in the Auckland suburb Wairu Valley.. ",

And he said Mr Nichols's mother was coping with her son's loss by hoping that his death could lead to change.. \"She believes in her heart Tyre was sent here for an assignment and that there is going to be greater good that comes from this tragedy,\" Mr Crump said. . The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was introduced in 2021 after Mr Floyd was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. His death sparked international protests.. The bill would see a federal ban on the use of chokeholds by police and make it easier to bring charges against offending officers. . Lawmakers in the House of Representatives - which was then controlled by the Democratic Party - passed the bill in March 2021, but it was later held up by opposition in the Senate. . \"Shame on us if we don't use his tragic death to finally get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed,\" Mr Crump told CNN. The lawyer said if the law did not change, deaths at the hands of police would continue. . Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP civil rights group - also called on legislators to take action. . \"By failing to write a piece of legislation, you're writing another obituary,\" Mr Johnson said in a statement. \"We can name all the victims of police violence, but we can't name a single law you have passed to address it.\". But the Republican House of Representatives Judiciary chair Jim Jordan warned politicians to not rush legislation. . \"These five individuals did not have any respect for life... I don't know if there's anything you can do to stop the kind of evil we saw in that video,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press programme. . A childhood friend of Mr Nichols told the BBC his legacy would be preserved through legal reform. Angelina Paxton said he \"always wanted to change the world\".  . Ms Paxton said Mr Nichols was \"very passionate about Black Lives Matter\".. \"He always wanted to make a difference,\" she said. \"If it gives anyone any comfort out of all those pain that we're all going through right now, just know that I can guarantee you he's up there right now smiling, because he finally did what he always wanted to do.\" . On Saturday, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the so-called Scorpion special unit of which the police officers now charged with murder were members. . The unit was a 50-person team that was tasked with bringing down crime levels - particularly car thefts and gang-related offences. . Scorpion stood for \"Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\".. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired from the Memphis police force last week.. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.. In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be \"more responsive\" and \"more proactive\" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols \"decided to go off the rails\".  . \"We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,\" she said. \"This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.\"  . Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who \"appeared on the scene following\" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation..
