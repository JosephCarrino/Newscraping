        "content": "The journalists were covering the killing of a woman when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . The other two victims in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have not yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the Spectrum News 13 journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",

        "content": "Mr Banga led credit card giant Mastercard for more than a decade and now works in private equity.. US officials said he had the experience to help the bank work with the private sector towards its goals.. It is up to the bank's board to officially appoint its next head.. On Wednesday, the bank said it planned to interview a shortlist of up to three candidates and aimed to name a new leader by early May. It said female nominees were strongly encouraged. . It is not clear if other countries will put forward other suggestions.. The US, the World Bank's biggest shareholder, has traditionally been in charge of selecting the person to lead the institution, which lends billions of dollars to countries each year.. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she wanted to see the World Bank serve as a \"force multiplier for good by setting the right agenda\".. She said Mr Banga was \"uniquely\" equipped to take on that charge, pointing to his track record of forging partnerships between governments, companies and non-profits.. Now a US citizen, Mr Banga started his career in his native India, where his father was an officer in the army. . Mr Banga's decades in business at firms such as Nestle and Citigroup might help inspire confidence in the bank in Congress, including from Republicans, who often criticise international organisations, said Amanda Glassman, executive vice president at the Center for Global Development.. But it remained to be seen whether he was the right pick, noting that he had less experience with the government and development work that is core the bank's job, she added.. \"We're looking forward to hearing his vision of what the bank should be,\" she said.. Whoever becomes the bank's next leader will face the challenge of trying to balance the immediate financial needs of low-income countries, many of them facing debt crises, while shifting to tackle issues such as climate change, global conflict and pandemic risks - all without any clear additional money on the table.. \"There is a lot riding on this next phase of the World Bank's strategy,\" Ms Glassman said. \"It's a moment when the World Bank can either step up to be really relevant or be marginalised and not important.\". While there is general consensus that the bank needs to evolve, \"there is less agreement on how, and there's a worry about the balancing act that needs to be done,\" she added.. If confirmed, Mr Banga would replace David Malpass, who was nominated by former US President Donald Trump and said this month he would step down from the post by June, nearly a year before his five-year term was set to end. . He had been criticised by environmental advocates for being slow to direct the bank's resources to address climate change. . Last year, he was publicly rebuked by the White House after he said he did not know if fossil fuels were driving climate change, remarks for which he later apologised. . ",

        "content": "Moldova has warned for weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. And officials rejected Russia's claims as \"psy-ops\" as part of the war.. \"The defence ministry believes it is an element of a psychological operation rather than a real plan,\" said state secretary Valeriu Mija.. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. . \"Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,\" she said.. Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country's sovereignty.. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine's power grid had knock-on effects.. Rampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. . There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as \"hybrid attacks\". . A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what his predecessor called \"multiple crises\".. President Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova's leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\".. Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match.. The Kremlin accused Moldova's leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.. Political analyst Denis Cenusa said . . If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.. On Moldova's eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. Dominated by Russian speakers, it proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. . A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.. As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria.  . That has not happened, but what Moldova's leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.. A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.. Ukrainian \"infiltrators\" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria's authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.. Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.. The head of Transnistria's peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia's warnings did \"give reasons for serious concerns\".. ",
