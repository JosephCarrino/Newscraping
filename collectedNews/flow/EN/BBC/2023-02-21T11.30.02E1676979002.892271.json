        "content": "It will come hours after Russia's president accused the West of being responsible for the war. . On Monday, Mr Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine to reaffirm America's support for Kyiv.. The competing speeches by both leaders come days before the first anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. . In Warsaw, the US president is expected to stress the vital role the United States has played in galvanising western backing for Ukraine against Russian aggression. . But he will also be looking to shore up support for his policy at home, where some politicians are expressing doubts about the scale of US involvement.. Earlier on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his annual state of the nation speech - accusing the West of hypocrisy and of withdrawing from \"fundamental agreements\". . \"I want to repeat: it is them who are culpable for the war, and we are using force to stop it,\" he said to great applause.. Mr Putin also reiterated his unfounded claim that Moscow had been facing a Nazi threat from Ukraine, which he used as justification to launch his \"special military operation\". . Ahead of his address, US President Joe Biden will meet Poland's leader, Andrzej Duda, and other central European allies to discuss bilateral cooperation and to strengthen Nato against aggression. . That's after the president met his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on Monday - telling a press conference that the US will back Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\". . \"We have every confidence you're going to continue to prevail,\" he said.. The pair also visited a memorial to soldiers who have died in the nine years since Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces captured parts of the eastern Donbas region.. After the visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new package of security assistance for Ukraine valued at $450m (£373m), as well as an extra $10m in emergency assistance to maintain Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. A new wave of sanctions against individuals and companies \"that are trying to evade or backfill Russia's war machine\" will also be announced later this week.. The US is one of Ukraine's biggest allies and has already given billions of dollars in military assistance. . Mr Biden recently announced that the US would .  and longer-range missiles but has stopped short so far of sending F-16 fighter jets, despite repeated calls for them from Ukraine.. However, Mr Zelensky on Monday said that he had discussed with Joe Biden the possibility of the US sending other weapons. . This video can not be played.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported that a larger group was initially kidnapped and some local guides have since been released.. The four people being held captive are the professor, who is an archaeologist from an Australian university, and three university students from PNG.. The police chief said overnight the kidnappers were \"opportunists\" who had \"obviously not thought this situation through\".. \"We are offering the abductors a way out,\" he said.. \"They can release their captives and they will be treated fairly through the criminal justice system, but failure to comply and resisting arrest could cost these criminals their lives.\". PNG Prime Minister James Marape on Monday said authorities had been having \"running conversations\" with the kidnappers and he sought to reassure families of the hostages.. \"I'm confident, I'm optimistic, I'm prayerful that we get… them out,\" he said.. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is yet to comment.. Earlier this month a New Zealand pilot was taken hostage by separatist fighters in Indonesia's nearby Papua region. Philip Mehrtens will be held until demands for Papua's independence are met, the group say.. ",

        "content": "WATCH: Dashcam footage shows moment of new Turkey earthquake. A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and 31 subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit.. Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP news agency he had been looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquakes when the latest tremors hit. . \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall,\" he said. . In the city of Adana, the latest earthquake drove people to a volleyball centre that had been converted into a rescue centre following the first earthquake.. The authorities have told the BBC they believe as many as 600 people may have arrived overnight - seeking a sturdy, ground-level building in which to take shelter.. When the quake struck, people were reported to have run out into the streets rather than staying put, reflecting the fact that there is still significant fear two weeks after the initial disaster. . In Syria, some 470 injured people are said to have visited hospitals after Monday's quakes, which were also reportedly felt in Egypt and Lebanon. . In a visit to Turkey on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid, saying that America would help with earthquake recovery \"for as long as it takes\"..
