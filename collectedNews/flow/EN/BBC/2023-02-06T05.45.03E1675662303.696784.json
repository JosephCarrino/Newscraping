She went on to thank her family, including her late uncle Jonny, who helped make her stage outfits before she became famous.. Beyoncé has previously said his battle with HIV influenced her interest in dance music, and its historical ties to the LGBTQ community, on Renaissance.. With the ceremony still ongoing, Beyoncé could extend her lead even further..

Smith's prize was their first Grammy since 2015, when they won four trophies, including best new artist.. However, the star let Petras take the microphone to mark an historical achievement.. \"Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,\" said the German-born singer.. She went on to thank the late, transgender pop artist Sophie for \"kicking these doors open\", and Madonna \"for fighting for LGBTQ rights\", before dedicating the award to her mother.. \"I grew up next to nowhere in Germany and my mother believed me, that I was a girl,\" she said, as Smith looked on with pride. \"I wouldn't be here without her and her support.\".

The pop legend introduced them as \"two incredibly talented artists who have risen above the noise, the doubt, the critics into something beautifully Unholy.\".

The singer told the audience she had written the first verse \"in the shower when I was choosing to change my son's life\", by divorcing her then-husband, Simon Konecki.. She added: \"I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it's very old school and very brave.\". Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt was the surprise winner of song of the year - beating favourites Taylor Swift and Beyoncé with her sorrowful ballad Just Like That.. Voters were undoubtedly moved by Raitt's tender lyrics, in which a woman mourning the death of her son finds comfort from the man who received his heart in a transplant.. \"I'm so proud that you appreciate this one,\" said the 72-year-old, accepting her trophy.. Bad Bunny opened the show in an explosion of colour, replicating a Puerto Rican fiesta in the aisles of Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena..
