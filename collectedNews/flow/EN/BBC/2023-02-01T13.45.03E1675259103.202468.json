        "content": "A huge search was triggered when the object was lost while being transported along a 1,400km (870 mile) route across the state. . Authorities released a close-up picture of the pea-sized capsule - which could cause serious harm if handled - on the ground among tiny pebbles.. A serial number enabled them to verify they had found the right capsule, which is 6mm (0.24 inches) in diameter and 8mm long.. It contains a small quantity of Caesium-137, which could cause skin damage, burns or radiation sickness.. Mining giant Rio Tinto apologised for losing the device, which is used as a density gauge in the mining industry.. A 20m \"hot zone\" has now been established around the capsule and it will be placed into a lead container.. It will be stored at a secure location in the town of Newman overnight before being transported to a secure facility in the city of Perth on Thursday.. Announcing their find, the state emergency services paid tribute to \"inter-agency teamwork in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds\".. The capsule was found when a vehicle equipped with specialist equipment, which was travelling at 70 km/h (43 mph), detected radiation, officials said.. Portable detection equipment was then used to locate the capsule, which was found about 2m (7ft) from the side of the road.. The device is part of a density gauge, which was being used at Rio Tinto's Gudai-Darri mine in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia. . \"The simple fact is the device should never have been lost,\" said the head of the company's iron ore division, Simon Trott. He thanked the authorities for the \"pretty incredible recovery\" of the capsule.. Rio Tinto would be happy to reimburse the cost of the search if requested by the government, Mr Trott added.. Australian authorities have promised a review of existing laws on the matter.  . Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Perth that the current fine for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is \"ridiculously low\".  It currently stands at A$1,000 ($700, £575) and A$50 ($35, £30) for every day that the offence continues.. Exposure to trace quantities of the metal is like \"receiving 10 X-rays in an hour, just to put it in context, and... the amount of natural radiation we would receive in a year, just by walking around,\" said Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew Robertson earlier this week.. It was thought that the capsule may have gone missing up to two weeks ago.. The search area for the lost capsule was huge. It is roughly equivalent to the distance by road from John O'Groats in northern Scotland to Land's End in south-west England, or from Washington DC to Orlando, Florida.. The state's desert is remote and one of the least populated places in the country. Only one in five of Western Australia's population lives outside of Perth, the state's capital.. The gauge was being transported by a subcontracted company, which picked it up from the mine site on 12 January to move it to a storage facility in the north-east suburbs of Perth.. When it was unpacked for inspection on 25 January the gauge was found broken apart and the radioactive capsule was gone. One of four mounting bolts and screws were also missing.. Authorities said vibrations during transit may have caused the bolts to become loose, allowing the capsule to fall through gaps in the casing and truck.. This incident came as Rio Tinto tries to repair its reputation in Australia.. In 2020, .  in Western Australia to expand an iron ore mine, sparking a major outcry that led to several of the company's top bosses standing down.. And last year, . , after an internal review at Rio Tinto found more than 20 women had reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over five years.. ",

        "content": "They also heap praise on Russia's Wagner mercenaries - even sharing recruitment information should followers want to join up.. Experts say that such misinformation drives mistrust between African nations and the West, and contributes to a lack of support for Ukraine on the continent.. Working with Logically, the tech organisation who traced the network, the BBC's Global Disinformation Team tracked down the surprising figure behind it: a 65-year-old Belgian politician who calls himself a Stalinist.. Russosphère describes itself as \"a network in defence of Russia\". Made up of several social media groups on different platforms, it was created in 2021 but fully launched in February 2022 - just days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The network swiftly gained over 80,000 followers.. After the invasion, Russian state media was restricted or banned from all mainstream social platforms. Russosphère was not, and quickly became active on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in addition to Telegram and VK - Russia's homegrown version of Facebook.. The discovery comes at a time of a swift deterioration in relationships between France and several African nations that analysts partly attribute to the Kremlin's influence and a growing pro-Russian sentiment fuelled by propaganda.. Kyle Walter is head of US investigations at Logically. Using data from their internal artificial intelligence-powered platform combined with open source intelligence, Logically tracked the network back to a man called Luc Michel.. In the past, Mr Michel has worked to legitimise votes in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, and been linked to \"Merci [thank you] Wagner\", a group supporting the work of the Russian mercenaries.. We contacted Mr Michel and he agreed to discuss Russosphère. He told us he created it, but said it received no financial support from Russia, saying it is funded by \"private money\".. He also insisted that he had no connections with Wagner and its head Yevgeny Prigozhin. \"I manage the cyberwar, the media war… and Prigozhin conducts military activities,\" he said.. According to Mr Walter, a co-author of Logically's report, this campaign is the first time Mr Michel's efforts have had real-world impact. \"Russosphère is the first time Luc Michel and the general influence operations he runs have had significant success,\" he says.. \"Even if the groups have been helped by bots in the beginning, they are now an authentic organic influence operation, with a large portion of real followers from across Africa.\". Mr Michel's early history may seem unusual for a self-proclaimed friend of Africa.. Born in 1958, he was politically active from a young age, first in the neo-fascist groups of his native Belgium, and later as a follower of Jean Thiriart, a former Nazi collaborator who envisioned a \"Euro-Soviet empire from Vladivostok to Dublin\", united against America.. His career took him to Libya in support of the country's leader at the time, Muammar Gaddafi. He also went to Burundi as an advisor to then-President Pierre Nkurunziza.. Throughout, he maintained a Russian connection, working with \"Nashi\", the Kremlin's youth movement, and creating a self-styled \"election-monitoring group\" that declared Moscow's 2014 illegal referendums in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk \"free and fair\". . \"I am a Stalinist,\" he told the BBC. \"I have defended Russia since the 1980s. I think that Russia is the only force left in Europe that is anti-American. I am nostalgic of the Soviet Union. I want a free world without America.\". It is difficult to assess the impact of specific disinformation campaigns, but in Africa the pro-Russian message is being heard - amplified, say analysts, by local influencers cultivated by Russia.. \"The success of people like Luc Michel is because of his opposition to France. It taps into real grievances on the ground,\" says Kevin Limonier, an associate professor at the University of Paris-8 studying Moscow's information operations in Africa.. \"Russian misinformation was a factor helping to drive the French forces out of Sahel countries, especially Burkina Faso,\" according to Ulf Laessing, from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a centre-right German think tank.. From 2013, some 5,000 French troops had been deployed to fight militant jihadist groups in Mali as well as in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania. But last year, they pulled out of Mali and are . .. They have been under pressure from the military governments in the two countries but Beverly Ochieng from BBC Monitoring agrees that popular sentiment may have had something to do with it.. \"Russian flags were waved at protests in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, and that is in part due to pro-Russian info-ops,\" she says.. In Burkina Faso, protesters attacked the French embassy and were heard demanding closer ties between Ouagadougou and Moscow.. This chimes directly with Mr Michel's aims. \"I think that Russia must replace the French in all of Africa,\" he told the BBC.. \"Estimating the impact of information operations is almost impossible,\" says Mr Limonier, expert in the Kremlin's influence campaigns. . But one thing is clear: such operations worry the West.. In Paris, according to Mr Limonier, \"the diplomats and the military, they read it, they see it and they say: 'Oh my gosh'.\". ",

        "content": "The call came as the UK, US, Canada and Australia announced fresh sanctions against army-linked firms.. The military has said the country is facing \"unusual circumstances\" - prompting fresh doubt over its pledge to hold an election this year. . Tayzar San, a prominent activist, said in a Facebook post that the strike was being conducted to provide proof that the \"public does not accept... the rigged election\" that the military was planning. . Images showed deserted streets in major cities, including the commercial centre of Yangon. . Thinzar Shunlei Yi, another pro-democracy activist, said resistance against the military was continuing, particularly in rural areas. . \"The main message of the silent strike is to honour the fallen heroes and heroines and to reclaim the public space as our own,\" she told the BBC, adding that the aim was to send a clear message that the military \"shall never rule us\". . Two years after a coup which catastrophically misread the public mood in Myanmar, the statistics tell their own, dismal story. . More than 2,900 people have been killed during the junta's crackdown on dissent, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.. One-and-a-half million people have been displaced, 40,000 homes have been burned down, eight million children are no longer in school, and 15 million people are judged by the UN to be dangerously short of food. . Much of the country is caught up in a brutal civil war. Yet the military is still refusing to negotiate with its opponents, as it promised to do in a meeting with neighbouring countries shortly after the coup. . Instead, it has plans for an election which would almost certainly exclude Aung San Suu Kyi, who resoundingly won the last election, and much of her party, the National League for Democracy. . Those loyal to her are calling on citizens to boycott any poll organised by the military, arguing it would be illegitimate and impractical. The UN says these would be \"sham elections\". . The military's acknowledgement this week that it had failed to normalise the situation may force it to postpone the election - originally scheduled for August this year - and extend the state of emergency, prolonging the grim stalemate in which Myanmar is trapped.. Western nations used Wednesday's anniversary to coordinate new rounds of sanctions against the military and its supporters. . The UK targeted, among others, companies supplying aviation fuel to the military, which it said were \"enabling its barbaric air-raiding campaign in an attempt to maintain power\".. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the sanctions were aimed at \"reducing the military's access to finance, fuel, arms and equipment\". . He added: \"The junta must be held to account for their brutal crackdown on opposition voices, terrorising air raids and brazen human rights violations.\" . Australia announced its first sanctions against the military, aimed at 16 individuals \"responsible for egregious human rights abuses\", as well as two major military-controlled conglomerates, which dominate the country's economy.  . Sanctions by the US targeted the military-approved election commission, which \"the regime has deployed to advance its plans for deeply flawed elections\". . The National Unity Government - a parallel administration that leads opposition to the military - welcomed the sanctions, calling them \"significant measures\" to tackle the conflict, particularly air strikes by the military.. It called on countries to place further \"aggressive, targeted sanctions\" on the military regime and those who support and supply them.. The military is expected to issue a statement on Wednesday that could extend a state of emergency. . ",

        "content": "Watch: \"You know I'm innocent\" - Andrew Tate yells to reporters. Handcuffed to his brother Tristan, he shouted to waiting reporters that he was innocent.. The pair have been held since late December as police investigate allegations of rape and exploitation, which both men deny.. Last month, a judge extended their detention until the end of February.. Police have not yet laid any charges against the brothers, who moved to Romania five years ago. . Filing an appeal against the custody extension on Wednesday, Andrew's lawyer Ioan Gliga told journalists that he had \"new evidence\" to refute prosecutors' arguments.  . \"The victims deny any wrongdoing - it's only in the minds of the prosecution that a crime has been committed,\" he said.. A verdict in the appeal is expected later today.. Also present in court was a new legal adviser hired by the Tate brothers from the United States. Tina Glandian has experience in representing high-profile figures such as Mike Tyson and Chris Brown, and specialises in international human rights.  . There is speculation that her appointment could bring a new approach to the Tates' legal team, as they try to secure the brothers' release from preventative custody.. The brothers - who have both US and British citizenship - have also employed a communications specialist to respond to media interest in the case.. In explaining his decision to keep the Tates in custody for another month, a judge last week issued a strongly worded statement, describing \"the capacity… of the defendants to exercise permanent psychological control over the victims... including by resorting to constant acts of violence\".. The testimony of alleged victims, he said, \"revealed a pattern of action\" that lent their reports credibility.  He also highlighted what he said was the \"particular dangerousness\" of the Tate brothers, in \"their ability to target… vulnerable victims\".. Since then, local media have reported that four complaints were made by alleged victims at a police station near the Tate compound - at least one of them as far back as 2021. At least one of the complaints was reportedly not acted on until the Tate investigation was underway.. The Police Inspectorate said in a statement that it had \"started checks\" into the actions of officers there, to determine if any legal measures should follow.. ",
