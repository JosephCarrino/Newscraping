        "content": "It is the latest energy firm to report record profits, after energy prices spiked following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.. America's ExxonMobil made $55.7bn, and Britain's Shell reported $39.9bn.. Aramco also declared a dividend of $19.5bn for the October to December quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.. Most of that will go to the Saudi government, which owns nearly 95% of the shares in the company. . Brent crude oil, the benchmark oil price, now trades at around $82 a barrel - though prices .  after Russia's invasion, and June.. \"Aramco rode the wave of high energy prices in 2022,\" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"It would have been difficult for Aramco not to perform strongly in 2022.\". In a statement on Sunday, .  the company results were \"underpinned by stronger crude oil prices, higher volumes sold and improved margins for refined products\".. Aramco's president and CEO Amin Nasser said: \"Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real - including contributing to higher energy prices.\". To address those challenges, he said, the company would not only focus on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production - but also invest in new lower-carbon technologies.. Aramco - the world's second-most valuable company only behind America's Apple - is a major emitter of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.. Responding to Aramco's announcement, Amnesty International's secretary general . : \"It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161bn in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel - the single largest driver of the climate crisis.\". She added: \"It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\". Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).. The Gulf kingdom has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents, and for the widespread use of capital punishment.. In a separate development on Sunday, Iran said its oil exports had reached their highest level since the re-imposition of . Oil Minister Javad Owji said exports increased by 83 million barrels in 2022 compared with the previous 12 months. In Iran, a new year starts in March. . Analysts say the rise is due to greater shipments to Iranian allies China and Venezuela. . Tehran's export revenues took a significant hit after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal five years ago.. The US sanctions, coupled with economic mismanagement and corruption, have meant that the Iranian economy has not had any substantive .  And by some measures, it is still 4-8% smaller than it was back in 2010.. ",

        "content": "It's why he and his family are moving out of the flat they've lived in for the last 15 years. The whole building has been condemned after failing an earthquake safety test. There's a very high chance that a tremor would bring this whole block crashing to the ground. . Here in Istanbul, fear is growing. . The two powerful earthquakes in Turkey's south that claimed almost 50,000 lives have brought a new urgency to its biggest city. Home to 15 million people, it sits on the North Anatolian fault line, and experts predict it's due its own major earthquake before 2030. . Around 70% of the city's buildings were built before rule changes that enforced stricter construction standards in 1999, and so are considered potentially unsafe. Just three months ago, a study said a quake here could kill up to 90,000 people. Now, the race is on to get the city ready.. Mesut knows all too well the devastation a quake can cause. He's just returned from the epicentre in the southern city of Kahramanmaras, where he lost relatives. As we talked in his now-empty flat, he described the moment he found out. . \"It happened at 04:17, a relative called and we all woke up screaming.\" Mesut's face crumples into tears and he turns away to compose himself. \"It's a horrible situation. We couldn't get [to Kahramanmaras] for three days because of snow, and when we reached the rubble it was so hard. I can't describe it. I hope God doesn't make anyone else experience this.\". When Mesut returned to Istanbul, the authorities had shut off power and water to his flat. \"I asked for them back again just so we could move. They gave me two more days.\". \"The municipality had sent us written warning about it, but the situation wasn't resolved due to rejections from the neighbours. We knew that our utilities were going to be shut off, and we were ready to leave here, but then the quake happened and it all became a shambles.\". Since the earthquakes in the south, there've been more than 100,000 new applications to the Istanbul municipality for building safety checks. The waiting list for one shot up to three months, then four, and it keeps rising. . Tenants as well as landlords can now apply, but some still don't because of the financial implications. The compensation to help those who need to move out of condemned buildings is low. There are no official numbers showing how many fail the test. . The city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has promised more training for rescue teams, and preparation of temporary shelters that could house up to 4.5 million people in the aftermath of a quake. But many fear it still isn't enough.. A walk down an average Istanbul street tells you why. Many of the buildings have particular design features that can make them collapse if they're put under pressure during a quake. . Dr Kurtulus Atasever, a structural and earthquake engineer, met me to point some of them out. We stood on an empty patch of ground, strewn with rocks, that used to be the foundations of a building. When a magnitude 5.8 quake hit Istanbul in 2019, it was so badly damaged it had to be knocked down. Up and down the street, its neighbours have many of the same flaws.. Good quality concrete is vital, he tells me. And the architecture is crucial. \"We have some overhangs here. In this type of building we have some weak or soft storeys. There are short columns too, they are actually all typical building problems.\" . In very simple terms, each of them weakens a building at ground level, meaning it struggles to hold up the floors above if there's an earthquake. An overhang makes the rest of the building wider than the footprint. Soft storeys are where the ground floor is taller than the floors above it. Short columns don't have enough length compared to their diameter. . They can be done safely, Dr Atasever points out, but only if proper thought and planning has gone into the design. In old buildings especially, that's rare. . We're standing in the shadow of Yasemin Suleymanoglu's house, and I ask if she's concerned about the apartment block it's in. She holds her daughter's hand and looks up at the face of the building. \"I don't feel safe here,\" she says. . \"Our building shook a lot during the 2019 earthquake, and the columns of the one across the street cracked. I've been feeling restless since that sound, and with this latest quake we are really scared. We're losing our sleep because it may hit us any time. And I think we're at risk because our building is old.\" . The next step is the development of a 50km (31-mile) long fibre-optic based early warning system. But for a city so huge, it's hard to know where people would go to seek shelter, even if they had notice that a quake was coming.. As pictures of the devastation in the south continue to fill Turkish TV screens, these concerns are now front-of-mind for a huge slice of Istanbul's population. And just two months away from important presidential and parliamentary elections, that really matters. . Overnight, the earthquake and its aftermath have joined Turkey's economic crisis as a key issue for voters. Many aren't happy with the government's handling of either. The aftershocks here aren't just physical, they're political too. . ",

        "content": " including that of an unborn child. . The attack took place shortly after worshippers finished their service. Police have told them that they cannot rule out the possibility of a so-called copycat attack, says Michael Tsifidaris, who speaks for the community here.  . He's smartly dressed in a business suit, but looks exhausted. It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.. He tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.. \"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\". The fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.  . There are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.. Detectives investigating the .  have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".. Mr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.. Those who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".. The police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.. \"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris. . \"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\". For now, the community is meeting online. Mr Tsifidaris, who refers to his fellow members as brothers and sisters, speaks often of the comfort to be found in supporting one another. \"We pray together, we cry together.\". Uppermost in their thoughts are those who remain seriously injured in hospital. He's adamant that their treatment is not compromised by a refusal to accept blood transfusions - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God forbids this.. They are not yet out of danger, he tells us, but the doctors say there's a fair chance most will survive. . For now, the focus is on supporting the bereaved and the traumatised. No one, he says, is left alone in their grief. . This attack has left a city in mourning and a community in shock and horror. It will, says Mr Tsifidaris, take years to heal. . ",

        "content": "Opponents say they threaten democracy.. At one of Saturday's rallies, opposition leader Yair Lapid said this was Israel's \"greatest crisis\".. In a separate development, Israeli troops shot dead three armed Palestinians near the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday, the Israeli army said. It said the gunmen had fired at an Israeli army post. . Palestinian officials have not commented on the incident. There has been a marked surge in violence between Palestinians and Israel . On Saturday, protest organisers said as many as 500,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Israel for the 10th consecutive week, in what the Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".. About 200,000 people turned up in Tel Aviv - many carrying Israel's national flag - to rally against planned reforms by Mr Netanyahu's hardline government.. A BBC producer in the city described the protests as the busiest yet, with a non-stop flow of demonstrators packing the streets until late into the night. . In remarkable scenes, crowds applauded Tel Aviv police chief Amichai Eshed as he walked in uniform through the rally. . On Thursday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had said he was transferring Mr Eshed to head a training division, amid reports the ultra-nationalist politician accused the commander of being too soft on protesters, whom he calls \"anarchists\". . But Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara later overruled Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the decision was being frozen, while national police chief Kobi Shabtai on Saturday said he had \"made a mistake\" in dismissing Eshed. . The clash over the commander's position is significant. It comes amid predictions of a possible constitutional crisis, involving Israel's civil service and security forces being unable to take orders from the government, if no compromise is reached on the planned reforms, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.. Speaking at the demonstrations in Tel Aviv, former Israel police chief Moshe Karadi described Mr Ben-Gvir's control of the force as an unprecedented danger. . He said the minister was \"a convicted felon, enacting a hostile takeover of the police and trying to turn it into a private militia to serve his political purposes\".. Mr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting terrorism over his backing of a Jewish extremist group. He has said police would have \"zero tolerance\" of demonstrators who block roads, with forces using water cannon and stun grenades against protesters last week. . Speaking in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Mr Lapid warned that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis.. \"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday .  But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.. In the northern city of Haifa, a record crowd of 50,000 marched on Saturday. . The reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges, and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. Last Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.. The government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. This video can not be played.
