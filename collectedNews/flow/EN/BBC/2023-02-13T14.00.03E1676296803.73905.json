        "content": "As it was travelling at 20,000ft (6,100m), it could have interfered with commercial air traffic, the US said.. A military commander said it could be a \"gaseous type of balloon\" or \"some type of a propulsion system\".. He added he could not rule out that the objects were extra-terrestrials.. The latest object - shot down over Lake Huron in Michigan near the Canadian border - has been described by defence officials as an unmanned \"octagonal structure\" with strings attached to it.. It was downed by a missile fired from an F-16 fighter jet at 14:42 local time (19:42 GMT).. The incident raises further questions about the spate of high-altitude objects that have been shot down over North America this month. . US Northern Command Commander General Glen VanHerck said that there was no indication of any threat.. \"I'm not going to categorise them as balloons. We're calling them objects for a reason,\" he said. . \"What we are seeing is very, very small objects that produce a very, very low radar cross-section,\" he added.. Speculation as to what the objects may be has intensified in recent days.. \"I will let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out,\" Gen VanHerck said when asked if it was possible the objects are aliens or extra-terrestrials.. \"I haven't ruled out anything at this point.\". A suspected Chinese spy balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February after hovering for days over the US. Officials said it originated in China and had been used to monitor sensitive sites.. China denied the object was used for spying and said it was a weather monitoring device that had blown astray. The incident - and the angry exchanges in its aftermath - ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Beijing.. But on Sunday, a defence official said the US had communicated with Beijing about the first object, after receiving no response for several days. It was not immediately clear what was discussed.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three further high-altitude objects in as many days.. President Biden ordered an object to be shot down over northern Alaska on Friday, and on Saturday a similar object was shot down over the Yukon in north-western Canada.. Both the US and Canada are still working to recover the remnants, but the search in Alaska has been hampered by Arctic conditions.. \"These objects did not closely resemble, and were much smaller than, the [4 February] balloon and we will not definitively characterise them until we can recover the debris,\" a White House National Security spokesperson said.. China's foreign ministry said on Monday .  in the past year.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a press briefing.. Detection of the most recent objects could be a result of widening the search from radars and sensors, a US official told the Washington Post on Saturday. . The official, who requested anonymity, likened it to a car buyer unchecking boxes on a website to broaden the parameters of what can be searched. But he said it was unclear whether this was producing more hits or if the new incursions are part of a more deliberate action.. US military shoots down suspected surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina. It had drifted for days over the US, and officials said it came from China and had been monitoring sensitive sites . US downs another object off northern Alaska which officials said lacked any system of propulsion or control. An American fighter jet shoots down a \"high-altitude airborne object\" over Canada's Yukon territory, about 100 miles (160 km) from the US border. It was described as cylindrical and smaller than the first balloon. US jets shoot down a fourth high-altitude object near Lake Huron \"out of an abundance of caution\" . One senior official told ABC News that the three most recent objects to be shot down were likely weather devices and not surveillance balloons.. But this was seemingly contradicted by the top Democrat in Congress, who earlier told the broadcaster that intelligence officials believed the objects were in fact surveillance balloons.. \"They believe they were [balloons], yes,\" . , adding that they were \"much smaller\" than the first one shot down off the South Carolina coast.. Democrat Debbie Dingell, one of several Michigan members of Congress who applauded the military for downing the object over the state on Sunday, joined growing calls for the White House and defence officials to provide more information.. \"We need the facts about where they are originating from, what their purpose is, and why their frequency is increasing,\" she said.. Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who represents Montana, told the BBC's US partner CBS: \"What's gone on the last two weeks or so... has been nothing short of craziness. And the military needs to have a plan to not only determine what's out there, but determine the dangers.\". Republicans have repeatedly criticised the Biden administration for its handling of the first suspected spy balloon, saying it should have been shot down far sooner.. Other countries are watching the response in the US closely, in case an object is discovered in their airspace.. In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his government will do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the country safe from the threat of spy balloons.. \"We have something called the quick reaction alert force which involves Typhoon planes, which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,\" he added..

        "content": "Presenting the report, the commission's president, child psychiatrist Pedro Strecht, described its objective as \"giving voice to the silence\" of victims.. He paid tribute to the hundreds who contacted its staff to provide testimony.. \"They have a voice; they have a name,\" he said.. In all, the commission documented 564 experiences of people who said they had been victims of abuse by priests or other Church officials. The exercise looked at cases dating back to 1950. . In many cases, testimony pointed to other minors having been abused - hence the estimate of thousands of further victims.. Throughout his presentation, Mr Strecht quoted victims' testimony, stressing the impact the abuse had on them. He cited the \"black hole\" in which one victim said that he had been living.. The president of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference, José Ornelas, Bishop of Leiria-Fátima, is due to make a statement later. . On Sunday, he said he had received the report \"with gratitude\", and that an extraordinary session scheduled for 3 March would ponder the best way to offer \"justice\" to victims.. According to the commission, a total of 25 cases have been passed to public prosecutors. Many others fell outside the statute of limitations.. Among the recommendations the report makes is that, in cases of alleged sexual abuse of minors, the existing provision for victims to be able make a criminal complaint until the age of 25, even if the statute of limitation applies, should be raised to 30..

A state of emergency has been declared in nine regions - affecting nearly a third of the 5.1 million population.. The storm was expected to peak on Monday night with the deluge to continue until Tuesday.. In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, authorities earlier evacuated people from 50 homes around a 30m-high tower that was in danger of collapse, local media reported. . Dozens of evacuation centres have also been set up in the city.. Emergency services have also reported people trapped by the rising waters - including a family stranded on a flooded highway. Authorities say they've received more than 100 calls for help since Sunday.. Cyclone Gabrielle is hitting New Zealand's north just weeks after Auckland and surrounding areas .  and flooding which killed four people.. New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was among those stranded in the northern city on Monday after flights to the capital Wellington, and elsewhere, were cancelled.. \"Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event,\" he said. \"Things are likely to get worse before they get better.\" . He announced a NZ$11.5m (£6m; US$7.3m) aid package on Monday.. Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said the government was considering declaring a national state of emergency for only the third time in the country's history.. Once an emergency is declared, local authorities have greater power to respond to dangerous situations including restricting travel and providing aid.. New Zealand's meteorological agency, Metservice, said Whangarei, a city north of Auckland, had received 100.5mm of rain in the past 12 hours. . Mr McAnulty had warned Monday would be a \"critical day\" due to the \"highly dangerous\" combination of high winds and heavy rain. . Winds of up to 140km/h (87mph) battered the Northland region, while the Auckland Harbour Bridge had to be closed as it was rocked by gusts of 110km/h.. For homes left without power, the minister warned it could also take days to restore the power grid as the bad weather made it \"unsafe\" to work on the network.. Weather officials had earlier downgraded Gabrielle's intensity, but the Metservice in its latest update on Monday said it would still bring \"significant heavy rain and potentially damaging winds\".. Although the cyclone has yet to make landfall, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines.. Many schools and local government facilities across Auckland and the North Island have closed and people are being asked not to travel before Tuesday.. Meanwhile some 10,000 international Air New Zealand customers were disrupted by the cancellation of 509 flights. . Normal services are expected to resume Tuesday, with the national carrier adding 11 extra domestic flights to its schedule to help with recovery efforts.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Relations between the two countries have since deteriorated. In recent days, the US says it has also shot down a number of other unidentified objects.. Questioned on Monday, Beijing said the US had made many airspace breaches.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing.. \"Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities.. \"The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,\" he added.. He said Beijing had responded to the incursions in a \"responsible and professional\" manner. . \"If you want to know more about US high-altitude balloons illegally entering China's airspace, I suggest you refer to the US side,\" he said.. Chinese state-affiliated media reported over the weekend that an unidentified flying object had been spotted off the country's east coast, and that the military was preparing to shoot it down.. Washington has yet to respond to the allegations from Beijing. . The first balloon incident had led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The top diplomat called China's alleged high-altitude spying \"unacceptable and irresponsible\".. On Sunday, the US ordered an unmanned \"octagonal structure\" to be downed in Michigan near the Canadian border - this was the fourth object to be taken out in eight days.. Fighter pilots also shot down smaller unidentified objects over Alaska on 10 February and northern Canada on 11 February..

        "content": "\"I'm thinking about bringing someone,\" .  \"I'm not sure, we'll see.\" . Naturally, fans assumed she was talking about one of the many artists she's collaborated with during her illustrious career. A guest spot from Jay-Z, Drake or Eminem seemed both likely and in keeping with the half-time show tradition of surprise duets.. But Rihanna wasn't referring to any of them. Although nobody twigged at the time, she was in fact hinting that she was pregnant with her second child. . The singer may have failed to debut any new music during her performance at Sunday's Super Bowl, but the baby bump she debuted instead almost broke the internet.. Wearing an all-red custom jumpsuit by Loewe, Rihanna appeared on one of several floating platforms which soared high above the crowd, as a swarm of energetic dancers, all dressed in white, gathered below.. The audience went wild as the singer launched straight into Better Have My Money - a somewhat ironic opener considering .  for her Super Bowl performance.. As the 34-year-old dazzled the crowd from on high, her dancers performed beneath her at breakneck speed, in a display of razor-sharp choreography which they would maintain throughout the whole performance. . The singer rattled through several recognisable hits, front-loading her set with some of her most danceable and up-tempo numbers including Only Girl (In The World) and the excellent Where Have You Been.. It was a half-time show not short on spectacle, even once she had been lowered to the ground. Fireworks were let off above the stadium as she launched into the euphoric We Found Love.. While rumours that the star might take the opportunity to perform new music failed to materialise, the decision to rely on her extensive back catalogue, one of the strongest in pop, was a sensible one.. The singer packed a huge number of hits .  only performing the first verse or chorus of certain songs. But monster hits such as Rude Boy were balanced with the somewhat harder-edged and lesser-known Pour It Up.. Somewhat disappointingly, the set list took advantage of some of her best-known collaborations - without any of her collaborators actually joining her on stage.. As she performed Run This Town, All of the Lights and Wild Thoughts, there were no appearances from Jay-Z, Ye (formerly Kanye West) or DJ Khaled, who normally feature on those tracks.. But their absence didn't matter. By this point, everyone's attention was firmly on an entirely different, and very visible, special guest.. 1. Better Have My Money. 2. Where Have You Been. 3. Only Girl (In The World). 4. We Found Love. 5. Rude Boy. 6. Work. 7. Wild Thoughts. 8. Birthday Cake (instrumental) / Pour It Up. 9. All of the Lights. 10. Run This Town. 11. Umbrella. 12. Diamonds. Confusion initially permeated social media as fans rushed to share their theories about Rihanna's apparent baby bump. Many pointed out the singer is known for her body positivity and could well have just been showing off her curvier figure following her previous pregnancy.. Although the star's bump was on display throughout, Rihanna did not draw attention to it quite as explicitly .  in 2011, where she memorably dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her jacket and rubbed her belly.. But as Rihanna's set progressed on Sunday, viewers became increasingly confident she was pregnant again, nine months after she and her partner A$AP Rocky welcomed their son.. Within an hour of Rihanna's performance drawing to a close, as her fans debated exactly which trimester she might be in, .  the singer's good news.. While some fans admitted to a tinge of disappointment that this will likely mean yet another delay to Rihanna's much-anticipated ninth studio album, the reaction on social media was overwhelmingly joyful. . Elsewhere, there were no costume changes during Rihanna's set - quite understandably - and her band looked positively tiny compared with the number of dancers. . Unlike last year's half-time show, .  Rihanna's set was distinctly light on political statements - something which may surprise those who remember why she previously turned down the Super Bowl..  in 2019 she had declined the invitation in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who controversially knelt during the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality. \"I just couldn't be a sellout. I couldn't be an enabler,\" she said at the time.. Four years later, \"taking the knee\" is much more commonplace, particularly in light of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and Rihanna's headlining of the Super Bowl is perhaps a sign of her approval of the NFL's progress in recent years.. Fans broadly agreed her performance was worth the wait, featuring a set list which she had joked earlier in the week had been through 39 drafts before it was finalised.. Rihanna even found time to subtly plug her cosmetics brand, by fixing her make-up mid-performance - something which quickly became . Meanwhile, the annual jokes about the culture clash between pop music fans and sports fans were in full swing on social media, with Rihanna even embracing them herself.. Ahead of the show, her clothing label manufactured T-shirts with the slogan: \"Rihanna concert interrupted by a football game. Weird but whatever.\" Model Cara Delevingne was among the attendees sporting one on Sunday.. Rihanna's fans admit she doesn't necessarily have the best voice in music. It's more distinctive than it is powerful, the kind of voice you would recognise instantly as hers on the radio, even if it was an unfamiliar song.. Ahead of her Super Bowl debut, .  \"Rihanna never needed to over-sing anything; she always sounded too cool to emote.\". But what has set Rihanna apart from some of her peers is the sheer number of hits she has to her name. In the late noughties and early 2010s, she churned out chart-toppers faster than the industry's top songwriters could compose them. . She released seven albums in as many years, scoring a new worldwide hit every few weeks. As a result, perhaps one inevitable disappointment with her Super Bowl set was the number of songs she simply couldn't squeeze in. . Some of her earlier smashes, such as Pon de Replay and SOS, would have gone down a treat, as would the pounding Don't Stop The Music and the catchy What's My Name (although we did get a tiny snippet of the latter right at the beginning, before she appeared on stage).. Other fan favourites, such as the rather graphic S&M, were probably wise to avoid, given the Super Bowl's history with pop stars offending family audiences during the half-time show. . However, the song wasn't missing entirely - its vocal hook was layered on top of We Found Love, while a few seconds of another risqué but popular track, Birthday Cake, were teased just before Pour It Up.. And surely everybody can be grateful that her set wasn't dragged down by her most recent release - Lift Me Up, from the soundtrack to Marvel's Wakanda Forever. A perfectly nice song which deserves its Oscar nomination, but one which would not have worked at the Super Bowl.. Instead, Rihanna deployed some of her biggest hits as she hurtled towards the end of her set, climaxing with her ode to British weather, Umbrella, and the rousing, anthemic Diamonds. . It may not have grabbed the headlines for the reasons fans were expecting, but Rihanna delivered a half-time show they will never forget.. ",
