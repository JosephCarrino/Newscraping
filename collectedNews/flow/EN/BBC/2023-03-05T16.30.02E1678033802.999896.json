        "content": "In the past few weeks, accusations have flown between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova over alleged .  and warnings about the potential for conflict to erupt here again.. Moldova's prime minister, Dorin Recean, has said Russian troops should be expelled from the region, amid warnings from President Maia Sandu that Moscow is planning to topple her pro-western government.. Russia, meanwhile, has been talking up the threat of a \"false flag\" attack by Ukrainian forces - and warned that any attack on its troops in Transnistria would be seen as an attack on Russia itself.. Many western analysts point out that Transnistria could provide Russia with another entry point into Ukraine, forcing Ukrainian troops away from other areas of fighting.. So Transnistria - controlled by pro-Russian separatists since .  - is being closely watched globally, but also by those much closer to home.. The warnings and threats about fresh conflict here hang heavy over the village of Molovata Noua.. This is a tiny Moldovan enclave, jammed up against Transnistrian territory and separated from the rest of Moldova by the River Dneister.. If residents of Chisinau feel vulnerable, residents of Molovata Noua feel completely exposed.. Many of the older men here fought pro-Russian separatists for this land 30 years ago. They're wondering now if they'll have to fight here again.. On Friday, veterans of that conflict gathered in Molovata Noua for an annual pilgrimage across the line of control into Transnistria, to honour those who died.. Two dozen men in military fatigues, bright medals on their chests and darkness behind their eyes. Among them, 62-year-old Vlad Untila.. \"We're lucky that Ukraine is defending us at the moment,\" he said, \"but if it kicks off in Moldova, we're ready to defend this territory again.\". Their convoy of cars makes its way down the deserted dirt road from Molovata Noua into the breakaway pro-Russian territory - crossing into enemy territory as they did three decades ago.. \"See how they look at us,\" Vlad growls, as his car approaches the Russian checkpoint.  . A gaggle of armed soldiers eye the convoy, as it carries men in Moldovan military fatigues into separatist territory, turning a blind eye to this eye-catching annual ritual.. \"Look around you,\" Vlad says, \"this is where we fought - it was all a battlefield.\". Now the narrow dirt road cuts through the silent countryside, flanked by brown fields and broken winter trees.. \"It's hard because I feel I'm in my own country,\" his friend Constantin joins in. \"It's my own land, and yet I can't walk freely here.\". A short drive beyond the checkpoint, hidden in brambles by the side of the road, is the first stop on the pilgrimage - a simple blue cross made from metal poles.. It marks the spot, 31 years ago, where a local mayor was killed.  The veterans gather round with a garland of flowers and a plastic bottle full of wine, to toast their fallen comrades.. They follow the trail of pale blue monuments dotted through this territory, repeating the ritual at every stop, honouring their comrades, siblings, and friends.. \"We were both snipers,\" Vlad remembers, at the spot his friend Vasea was killed. \"They were shooting at us from that hill over there, from a tank. One of the shrapnel fragments hit him in the neck. He fell to the ground and died in my arms.\". As the veterans pass a local Moldovan school, pupils come out to greet them, led by their headmistress Tatiana Rosca.. \"There were big battles here in 1992,\" Tatiana says.  \"And there are still deep wounds in the souls of the people.  We're very afraid: we know what war means and we don't wish it on anyone.\". One of her pupils says she's ready to take up arms if conflict erupts again, as her father and grandfather did 30 years ago.. But loyalties here - as in the rest of Moldova - are complicated by history, geography and economics.  . Here on the other side of the River Dniester, the pull of Moldovan identity is set against the pull of subsidised Russian gas from Transnistria.. The economic gulf with the rest of the country has widened since the start of the war in Ukraine, after Moscow cut gas supplies to Moldova last year.. \"I'll be honest,\" the mayor of Molovata Noua, Oleg Gazea, told me. \"It's very difficult to convince people that life is better in Moldova when they pay a fraction of the price for gas here.\". \"We can't talk about freedom and a better life, and at the same time tell them to go across the river and pay 30 times more for their bills - they'll tell us: are you crazy? But there's a hidden price [to the cheap gas] - it buys their support.\". Some people here firmly believe that Moscow is not a military threat, but an economic ally - and that president Maia Sandu is the one provoking a war by moving closer to the West.. \"Transnistria is really sticking up for us,\" 59 year old Maria Ursachi tells me.  . \"But Moldova is a disappointment. People are afraid to come over the river to talk to us: they have a border control post there and they check our bags. Chisinau doesn't see us.\". Arriving back in Molovata Noua, the veterans end their pilgrimage in the village square by laying red carnations at a memorial to the frozen conflict here.. In the years since they fought the pro-Russian separatists, their children have grown up alongside Russian soldiers, Russian language and Russian economic support.. \"We older men will still form the heart of any resistance\", Vlad tells me, \"even with the involvement of younger men.\". Memories of the past, that linger in this tiny Moldovan enclave, are being sharpened by growing fears for the future. . ",

Started in 1969 and now in its 28th edition, the biennial event was this time watched over by military rulers..  and the Fespaco film festival happens only once every two years. So photos from Saturday's ceremony show military men with red berets and machine guns alongside Africa's artistic elite.. Chebbi himself did not attend the award ceremony. It is not known if this was an act of conscientious objection to Burkina Faso's current political situation.. But the man who collected the prize on Chebbi's behalf from soldier-turned-President Ibrahim Traoré, said that winning the Etalon d'or du Yennenga - as the top award is known - \"means a lot\" to Chebbi.. The festival attracts thousands from across the continent with filmmakers from Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, South Africa and more taking part this year. Nearly half of all entries in the fiction category were directed by women.. Sira, the tale of a woman's struggle for survival after being kidnapped by jihadis in the Sahel, won Burkinabè director Apolline Traoré second place in the fiction category.. And third place went to Kenya's Angela Wanjiku Wamai for Shimoni.. In her closing remarks at Saturday's awards ceremony, Fespaco jury head and producer Dora Bouchoucha, made apparent reference to . .. \"I am deeply sad and at the same time grateful my actions in terms of promoting African cinema are recognised in Burkina Faso,\" said Ms Bouchoucha..

        "content": "They will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.. The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.. But this year's sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions. . They will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while \"strengthening party-building work\" in private businesses, according to state media.. The moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party's control of the private sector.. This comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was .  in the tech sector.. This week's NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi's leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.. He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party . . . It was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China's first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.. Mr Xi's appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.. At the start of the meeting, it was announced that China will pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year, while defence spending is to rise by more than 7%.. Abroad, Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.. The NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China's equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.. Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi's most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines. . Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October's party congress, will deliver his last work report speech. . The political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi's cabinet, will also be announced.. Many will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.. Observers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.. ",

        "content": "Protests have continued for days.. Clashes with police were reported on Sunday as thousands joined a demonstration in the capital Athens.. Police estimated 12,000 people attended the protest. . Some demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.. The protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading \"Down with killer governments\".. On the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track. . The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.. The train crash has been widely attributed to human error. . Earlier this week, a 59-year-old station master in Larissa was charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court. His lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident.. But many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. Union members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. Train drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.. The transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a \"sign of respect\" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.. Immediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.. ",
