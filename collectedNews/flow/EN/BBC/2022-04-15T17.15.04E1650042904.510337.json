        "content": "Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach.. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by the offer.. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: \"I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it.\" . He added that he had a \"Plan B\" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean.. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. \"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" he said.. On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own.. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to \"unlock\" the company's \"extraordinary potential\" and that if his offer was not accepted, \"I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\". He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be \"utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote\". . Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: \"I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects.\". The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: \"What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?\". Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the \"unsolicited, non-binding\" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer.. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder.. Asset management firm Vanguard Group .  that its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot.. This video can not be played. Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive.. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley.. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be \"toying with the company to some extent\".. \"The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think.\". He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders.. \"To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution.. \"I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,\" he added.. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer.. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach.. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. . But details have emerged of an \"all hands\" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. . The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being \"held hostage\". . I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. \"I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,\" they said.. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. \"I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,\" they said. . Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer.. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe..

        "content": "\"The wonderful woman who cooked at our church and her son, who was in a wheelchair, were both killed when an artillery shell hit their apartment. I now know of several other of our parishioners who have died.\". Like most clergy in the region of north-eastern Ukraine where he is from, Father Pluzhnik belonged to the branch of the Russian Orthodox Church which takes its direction from its religious leadership in Moscow.. But now, he says, has applied to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - which was . , in a move never recognised by Russia. . He says many fellow priests who followed Patriarch Kirill in Moscow are doing the same because of the Church leader's stance on the war.  . Father Pluzhnik and his family fled under artillery fire and now have a temporary new home in the town of Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine.. \"When the war started, I was waiting to hear from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the 'father' of our church. But first there was no reaction at all, and then there was worse,\" he says.. \"Patriarch Kirill blessed the Russian army and gave his blessing to the war. It was not just him but the majority of priests of the Moscow Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church] including some that even have Ukrainian roots. I was in shock.\" . As well as having failed to unequivocally condemn the killing of innocent people in Ukraine, or call for a ceasefire, the Patriarch has held large televised services in Moscow to bless Russian troops. He has also suggested in sermons that the Kremlin's war is a righteous one about the future of Christianity.. \"What is happening today is much more important than politics,\" he said last month. \"We are talking about human salvation, about where humanity will end up and on which side of God the Saviour.\". There are religious undertones in much of the Kremlin's narrative justifying its invasion of Ukraine. It is a fight for the conservative ideals of the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow, against an immoral outside world. President Putin has said Ukraine is not only an \"inalienable part\" of Russia's history and culture - but also its \"spiritual space\".  . The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has said he finds Patriarch Kirill's sentiment concerning.. \"There are elements in the Russian Christian tradition that can become really toxic when they get in their head a particular kind of Christian nationalism, a sort of messianic approach to the fate of the nation,\" said Dr Williams during a visit to western Ukraine this week.. He was part of an extraordinary high-level, multi-faith delegation - including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist leaders. They met refugees who had fled the horrors in the eastern part of the country.. Dr Williams has long studied and written about the positive contribution of the Russian Orthodox Church, and appears deeply saddened by the role the Moscow Patriarchate is playing in the war.. \"I think that the increasing influence in the Patriarchate of Moscow of ultranationalist ideals - often including a strand of anti-Semitism - has been going on for some time. . \"And it has now expressed itself in this very uncritical support of Russian national ambitions, a very aggressive attitude towards many other Orthodox churches. The writing has been on the wall for some time,\" he said.. Patriarch Kirill has echoed President Putin's claim that Russian speakers and followers of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church living in eastern Ukraine need liberating after years of oppression.. \"Our brothers and sisters were really suffering, they suffer for their loyalty to the Church,\" said Patriarch Kirill a week into the war.. But Father Pluzhnik, a Russian speaker and a follower of the Moscow Patriarchate all of his adult life, is angered by those claims.. \"When I hear them say they are protecting us and fighting some 'Holy War', I think they are either blind, or they are not serving God but the devil,\" he says.. \"We were living peacefully until they came. But far from protecting us they bombed and tortured and killed. Before the war, parishioners were completely free to choose what church they went to, they just went to the church closest to their home. For many of them it was not even a significant difference to go to a church that followed Moscow or not, they just wanted to pray to God. Now that has changed.\" . Dr Sergii Bortnyk, a professor at the Kyiv Theological Academy and an adviser to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, acknowledges that there has been a widespread movement of people and parishes across the country abandoning their loyalty to Moscow.. \"I think it is maybe half of the 12,000 parishes [of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine] that have said that they want to break away now,\" says Dr Bortnyk.. \"Patriarch Kirill has not said anything about all the Christians in Ukraine that have been killed, so I believe the members of our church are free to end their connection to him as the patriarch,\" he says.. \"The connection to all of our [Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox] Church in Ukraine to Moscow is in question now.\". The Kremlin's aim, backed by the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, had been to unite Russia and Ukraine in a single \"spiritual space\".. But the manner by which they have tried to achieve that appears to have had precisely the opposite effect.. ",
