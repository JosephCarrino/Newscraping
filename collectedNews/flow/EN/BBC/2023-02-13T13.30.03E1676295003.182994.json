        "content": "Relations between the two countries have since deteriorated. In recent days, the US says it has also shot down a number of other unidentified objects.. Questioned on Monday, Beijing said the US had made many airspace breaches.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing.. \"Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities.. \"The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,\" he added.. He said Beijing had responded to the incursions in a \"responsible and professional\" manner. . \"If you want to know more about US high-altitude balloons illegally entering China's airspace, I suggest you refer to the US side,\" he said.. Chinese state-affiliated media reported over the weekend that an unidentified flying object had been spotted off the country's east coast, and that the military was preparing to shoot it down.. Washington has yet to respond to the allegations from Beijing. . The first balloon incident had led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The top diplomat called China's alleged high-altitude spying \"unacceptable and irresponsible\".. On Sunday, the US ordered an unmanned \"octagonal structure\" to be downed in Michigan near the Canadian border - this was the fourth object to be taken out in eight days.. Fighter pilots also shot down smaller unidentified objects over Alaska on 10 February and northern Canada on 11 February.. Mr Wang said he had \"no understanding of [these other objects]\".. \"But what we want to tell everyone here is that the US' frequent firing of advanced missiles used to strike down unidentified flying objects is an overreaction of excessive force,\" he said.. A US military commander, General Glen VanHerck, said that there was no indication of any threat from the latest object. . He said it could be a \"gaseous type of balloon\" or \"some type of a propulsion system\", adding he could not rule out that the objects were extra-terrestrials.. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government will do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the country safe from the threat of spy balloons.. \"We have something called the quick reaction alert force which involves Typhoon planes, which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,\" he added..

        "content": "Watch: Huge waves and heavy rain as Cyclone Gabrielle lashes New Zealand. At least 46,000 homes have lost power in the storm, while hundreds of flights have been cancelled.. A state of emergency has been declared in nine regions - affecting nearly a third of the 5.1 million population.. The storm was expected to peak on Monday night with the deluge to continue until Tuesday.. In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, authorities earlier evacuated people from 50 homes around a 30m-high tower that was in danger of collapse, local media reported. . Dozens of evacuation centres have also been set up in the city.. Emergency services have also reported people trapped by the rising waters - including a family stranded on a flooded highway. Authorities say they've received more than 100 calls for help since Sunday.. Cyclone Gabrielle is hitting New Zealand's north just weeks after Auckland and surrounding areas .  and flooding which killed four people.. New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was among those stranded in the northern city on Monday after flights to the capital Wellington, and elsewhere, were cancelled.. \"Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event,\" he said. \"Things are likely to get worse before they get better.\" . He announced a NZ$11.5m (£6m; US$7.3m) aid package on Monday.. Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said the government was considering declaring a national state of emergency for only the third time in the country's history.. A state of emergency has already been declared in five northern regions. The declaration gives local authorities greater power to respond to dangerous situations and allows them to restrict travel and provide aid.. New Zealand's meteorological agency, Metservice, said Whangarei, a city north of Auckland, had received 100.5mm of rain in the past 12 hours. . Mr McAnulty had warned Monday would be a \"critical day\" due to the \"highly dangerous\" combination of high winds and heavy rain. . Winds of up to 140km/h (87mph) battered the Northland region, while the Auckland Harbour Bridge had to be closed as it was rocked by gusts of 110km/h.. For homes left without power, the minister warned it could also take days to restore the power grid as the bad weather made it \"unsafe\" to work on the network.. Weather officials had earlier downgraded Gabrielle's intensity, but the Metservice in its latest update on Monday said it would still bring \"significant heavy rain and potentially damaging winds\".. Although the cyclone has yet to make landfall, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines.. Many schools and local government facilities across Auckland and the North Island have closed and people are being asked not to travel before Tuesday.. Meanwhile some 10,000 international Air New Zealand customers were disrupted by the cancellation of 509 flights. . Normal services are expected to resume Tuesday, with the national carrier adding 11 extra domestic flights to its schedule to help with recovery efforts.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "\"I'm thinking about bringing someone,\" .  \"I'm not sure, we'll see.\" . Naturally, fans assumed she was talking about one of the many artists she's collaborated with during her illustrious career. A guest spot from Jay-Z, Drake or Eminem seemed both likely and in keeping with the half-time show tradition of surprise duets.. But Rihanna wasn't referring to any of them. Although nobody twigged at the time, she was in fact hinting that she was pregnant with her second child. . The singer may have failed to debut any new music during her performance at Sunday's Super Bowl, but the baby bump she debuted instead almost broke the internet.. Wearing an all-red custom jumpsuit by Loewe, Rihanna appeared on one of several floating platforms which soared high above the crowd, as a swarm of energetic dancers, all dressed in white, gathered below.. The audience went wild as the singer launched straight into Better Have My Money - a somewhat ironic opener considering .  for her Super Bowl performance.. As the 34-year-old dazzled the crowd from on high, her dancers performed beneath her at breakneck speed, in a display of razor-sharp choreography which they would maintain throughout the whole performance. . The singer rattled through several recognisable hits, front-loading her set with some of her most danceable and up-tempo numbers including Only Girl (In The World) and the excellent Where Have You Been.. It was a half-time show not short on spectacle, even once she had been lowered to the ground. Fireworks were let off above the stadium as she launched into the euphoric We Found Love.. While rumours that the star might take the opportunity to perform new music failed to materialise, the decision to rely on her extensive back catalogue, one of the strongest in pop, was a sensible one.. The singer packed a huge number of hits .  only performing the first verse or chorus of certain songs. But monster hits such as Rude Boy were balanced with the somewhat harder-edged and lesser-known Pour It Up.. Somewhat disappointingly, the set list took advantage of some of her best-known collaborations - without any of her collaborators actually joining her on stage.. As she performed Run This Town, All of the Lights and Wild Thoughts, there were no appearances from Jay-Z, Ye (formerly Kanye West) or DJ Khaled, who normally feature on those tracks.. But their absence didn't matter. By this point, everyone's attention was firmly on an entirely different, and very visible, special guest.. 1. Better Have My Money. 2. Where Have You Been. 3. Only Girl (In The World). 4. We Found Love. 5. Rude Boy. 6. Work. 7. Wild Thoughts. 8. Birthday Cake (instrumental) / Pour It Up. 9. All of the Lights. 10. Run This Town. 11. Umbrella. 12. Diamonds. Confusion initially permeated social media as fans rushed to share their theories about Rihanna's apparent baby bump. Many pointed out the singer is known for her body positivity and could well have just been showing off her curvier figure following her previous pregnancy.. Although the star's bump was on display throughout, Rihanna did not draw attention to it quite as explicitly .  in 2011, where she memorably dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her jacket and rubbed her belly.. But as Rihanna's set progressed on Sunday, viewers became increasingly confident she was pregnant again, nine months after she and her partner A$AP Rocky welcomed their son.. Within an hour of Rihanna's performance drawing to a close, as her fans debated exactly which trimester she might be in, .  the singer's good news.. While some fans admitted to a tinge of disappointment that this will likely mean yet another delay to Rihanna's much-anticipated ninth studio album, the reaction on social media was overwhelmingly joyful. . Elsewhere, there were no costume changes during Rihanna's set - quite understandably - and her band looked positively tiny compared with the number of dancers. . Unlike last year's half-time show, .  Rihanna's set was distinctly light on political statements - something which may surprise those who remember why she previously turned down the Super Bowl..  in 2019 she had declined the invitation in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who controversially knelt during the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality. \"I just couldn't be a sellout. I couldn't be an enabler,\" she said at the time.. Four years later, \"taking the knee\" is much more commonplace, particularly in light of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and Rihanna's headlining of the Super Bowl is perhaps a sign of her approval of the NFL's progress in recent years.. Fans broadly agreed her performance was worth the wait, featuring a set list which she had joked earlier in the week had been through 39 drafts before it was finalised.. Rihanna even found time to subtly plug her cosmetics brand, by fixing her make-up mid-performance - something which quickly became . Meanwhile, the annual jokes about the culture clash between pop music fans and sports fans were in full swing on social media, with Rihanna even embracing them herself.. Ahead of the show, her clothing label manufactured T-shirts with the slogan: \"Rihanna concert interrupted by a football game. Weird but whatever.\" Model Cara Delevingne was among the attendees sporting one on Sunday.. Rihanna's fans admit she doesn't necessarily have the best voice in music. It's more distinctive than it is powerful, the kind of voice you would recognise instantly as hers on the radio, even if it was an unfamiliar song.. Ahead of her Super Bowl debut, .  \"Rihanna never needed to over-sing anything; she always sounded too cool to emote.\". But what has set Rihanna apart from some of her peers is the sheer number of hits she has to her name. In the late noughties and early 2010s, she churned out chart-toppers faster than the industry's top songwriters could compose them. . She released seven albums in as many years, scoring a new worldwide hit every few weeks. As a result, perhaps one inevitable disappointment with her Super Bowl set was the number of songs she simply couldn't squeeze in. . Some of her earlier smashes, such as Pon de Replay and SOS, would have gone down a treat, as would the pounding Don't Stop The Music and the catchy What's My Name (although we did get a tiny snippet of the latter right at the beginning, before she appeared on stage).. Other fan favourites, such as the rather graphic S&M, were probably wise to avoid, given the Super Bowl's history with pop stars offending family audiences during the half-time show. . However, the song wasn't missing entirely - its vocal hook was layered on top of We Found Love, while a few seconds of another risqué but popular track, Birthday Cake, were teased just before Pour It Up.. And surely everybody can be grateful that her set wasn't dragged down by her most recent release - Lift Me Up, from the soundtrack to Marvel's Wakanda Forever. A perfectly nice song which deserves its Oscar nomination, but one which would not have worked at the Super Bowl.. Instead, Rihanna deployed some of her biggest hits as she hurtled towards the end of her set, climaxing with her ode to British weather, Umbrella, and the rousing, anthemic Diamonds. . It may not have grabbed the headlines for the reasons fans were expecting, but Rihanna delivered a half-time show they will never forget.. ",
