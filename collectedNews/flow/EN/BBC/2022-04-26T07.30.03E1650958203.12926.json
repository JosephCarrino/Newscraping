        "content": "He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Mr Musk said . . . \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\" he added. . \"Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\". The move comes as Twitter faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation on the platform.. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". . At the time Mr Musk observed: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.\". News of the takeover has been cheered by the right in the US, although Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform.. The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: \"No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms.\". On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an \"extraordinary development in the world of social media\". . \"It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate.\". Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself.. In 2018 US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40 million settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny.. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand \"pedo guy\" on the platform. . On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate.. \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,\" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced.. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. . Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.  . Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published.. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced. . But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm.. Mr Musk has said he doesn't \"care about the economics\" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance.. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. . The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook.. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was \"the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders\".. It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November.. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: \"I don't have confidence in management.\". Mr Agrawal told employees on Monday that the future of Twitter is uncertain.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. . Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted . Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. . He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. . The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. . The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning. . From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter. . He himself has said it's not about the \"economics\", this is about power and influence. . By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter. . He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy. . He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works. . The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now. . For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted. . Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation. . You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for. . The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly. . This video can not be played. The Olympic champion who turned his back on Putin.

        "content": "Nina Malenok's home is just by the side of a road that Russian troops used as they began their invasion of Ukraine, on their way to the northern city of Chernihiv, and the capital Kyiv. . Wedged into the yard of Nina's home is the tail of a rocket fired in the early hours of the 24 February - the day the war started. . \"I heard it land in my yard. There was fire and smoke everywhere. My lights went off. I jumped out of bed and ran out my house,\" said Nina.. In the days that followed, hidden in a cellar, she heard planes flying overhead, heavy vehicles driving in and whistles being frequently blown.. On 8 March, Russian TV journalists came to her home accompanied by Russian soldiers. . \"They were filming everything here, all the shells and everything. They told me Ukraine was attacking itself. Then they sent the numbers [printed] on the rocket to someone in Russia, and received a response right away that it was one of theirs.\". Many such rockets are scattered all over the village. Experts who've seen images of the rockets have told the BBC that they could have been carrying cluster bombs, banned in other parts of the world for the devastation they cause. Both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of using them. . Even after the withdrawal, Nina does not feel safe. . \"It's scary to live like this, but I'm used to my house, Where will I go? I can hear the shelling. I can show you from my yard the Russian checkpoint,\" she said.. Her home, and others in the village are visible from Russia. Its troops can see what they have been firing at.. For Lidiya Bilousova, it's the second time in her life she saw tanks at her doorstep.. Born in 1930, she vividly remembers World War Two and German soldiers coming into their village. . 'We'd been warned by our retreating soldiers that they would be coming. So we hid in the trenches with dry bread in cloth bags. At dawn, they were in our streets, with their horses and machinery, crossing our gardens with machine guns. But there was no mass shelling like there is now,\" she said. \"Back in the day, I could run away. Now I'm old. I can't anymore.\". \"Here's what I'll tell you, there is nothing good about war,\" Lidiya said. \"After the last war [World War Two] what were we left with?\". The shelling frightens her, but she is unwilling to leave the home she's lived in for most of her life. . Prior to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, the three-way border crossing would be opened and a unity festival would be celebrated at the point where the countries meet, where a monument dedicated to the friendship between them called \"Three Sisters\" still stands. . 'It was a beautiful festival. We, the Russians, the Belarusians would celebrate together. People from all over, important dignitaries would all come,\" she said. . Lidiya's late husband was Belarusian. . \"The three countries were friends for years, we visited each other, married each other. Now it's over.\". Families and friendships spread across borders have been divided, both in thought and in distance. After 2014, crossing the border became harder for people on all sides. Now, it's impossible.. Mykhaylo Dudko's two brothers, a sister, nephews and nieces live in Russia. He hasn't met his family in years. Now, he's unable to understand them.. \"My sister told me it was us who started the war. But we had no such intention.  It was Russia which invaded us. I want my family to use their heads, to look at the situation independently,\" he said. . Nina Malenok said she's stopped talking to her brother who lives in Belarus.. \"He says it's America who attacked you, and you blame Russia. He's just five miles away across the border, and he doesn't believe what's really happening,\" she said. \" I want to cross him out of my life because of that.\"  .
