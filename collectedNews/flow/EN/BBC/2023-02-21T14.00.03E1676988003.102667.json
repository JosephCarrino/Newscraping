        "content": "The men had held a wedding ceremony in 2019, but same-sex marriage is not recognised in South Korea.. Activists say the ruling is a leap forward for LGBT rights in the country.. However, the case will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  . The plaintiff, So Seong-wook said he welcomed the ruling and \"recognition of a very obvious right that has not been given\".. In 2021, he sued the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) after being denied coverage on his partner Kim Yongmin's plan.. The couple had been granted coverage at first, but this was then revoked as the NHIS said they had made a mistake in granting it to the same-sex couple.. Celebrating the ruling, Mr So praised the court for seeing \"the principle of equality as an important issue\".. \"I think it has a great meaning for LGBTQ people who have been in a discriminatory situation, those who support them and all those who are discriminated against,\" he told the BBC.. The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's verdict. It found spousal coverage under the NHIS extended to not just families as defined by law. . It also found that denying same-sex couples such benefits amounted to discrimination.. \"Everyone can be a minority in some way. To be in the minority is to be different from the majority and cannot be wrong itself,\" the court judgement read.. \"In a society dominated by the principle of majority rule, awareness of the rights of minorities and efforts to protect them are necessary.\". A Human Rights Watch report last year found that discrimination against LGBT people in South Korean society remained \"pervasive\". . Same-sex couples  - without the legal status of marriage - are often excluded from government benefits for newlyweds.. After Tuesday's court ruling, Amnesty International released a statement saying: \"There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTI community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome.\".

The design fault was made public earlier this month. . The Spanish government says the mistake was spotted early enough to avoid financial loss. However the region of Cantabria has demanded compensation. . Renfe ordered the trains in 2020 but the following year manufacturer CAF realised that the dimensions it had been given for the trains were inaccurate and stopped construction.  . The rail network in northern Spain was built in the 19th Century and has tunnels under the mountainous landscape that do not match standard modern tunnel dimensions. . The mistake means the trains will be delivered in 2026, two years late. . Renfe and infrastructure operator Adif have launched a joint investigation to find out how the error could have happened. Earlier this month, Spain's transport ministry fired a Renfe manager and Adif's head of track technology over the blunder.. ",

        "content": "WATCH: Dashcam footage shows moment of new Turkey earthquake. A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and 31 subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit.. Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP news agency he had been looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquakes when the latest tremors hit. . \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall,\" he said. . In the city of Adana, the latest earthquake drove people to a volleyball centre that had been converted into a rescue centre following the first earthquake.. The authorities have told the BBC they believe as many as 600 people may have arrived overnight - seeking a sturdy, ground-level building in which to take shelter.. When the quake struck, people were reported to have run out into the streets rather than staying put, reflecting the fact that there is still significant fear two weeks after the initial disaster. . In Syria, some 470 injured people are said to have visited hospitals after Monday's quakes, which were also reportedly felt in Egypt and Lebanon. . In a visit to Turkey on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid, saying that America would help with earthquake recovery \"for as long as it takes\".. It is one of several countries to have offered their help in the wake of the first earthquake. . Rescue operations had .  in all but two areas, with hopes of finding people alive fading fast. .
