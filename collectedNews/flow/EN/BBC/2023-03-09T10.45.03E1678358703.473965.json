        "content": "Ms Herman's lawsuit does not detail any allegation of harassment or assault. . She argues in another lawsuit she is owed around $30m (£25m) and was locked out of a home she shared with Mr Woods. . Mark Steinberg, a representative for Mr Woods, 47, did not immediately reply to a BBC News request for comment on Wednesday. . The civil lawsuit challenging the NDA was filed on Monday in Martin County, Florida, near where the couple had been living together. . It says that Ms Herman's agreement with Mr Woods is \"invalid and unenforceable\" due to the passage of the Speak Out Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in December 2022 and limits the enforceability of NDAs in cases of sexual assault or harassment. . Ms Herman, her lawyers say, is \"currently unsure what other information about her own life she may discuss or with whom\".. Her attorney Benjamin Hodas, did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. The couple's break-up has not been formally announced. They have not been seen together in public since attending the US Open tennis tournament in New York last August. . Ms Herman, 38, had previously worked at the 15-time major champion's Florida restaurant, The Woods Jupiter.. A separate lawsuit she filed in October against a homestead trust held by Mr Woods alleges that she was tricked into leaving the home that they had shared in order to lock her out. . \"Specifically, by trickery, agents of the Defendant convinced the Plaintiff to pack a suitcase for a short vacation and, when she arrived at the airport, they told her she had been locked out of her residence,\" according to the court documents seen by the BBC.. That legal action says Ms Herman's personal possessions were subsequently removed from the home in Hobe Sound, Florida.. She also says that $40,000 of her money was \"misappropriated\", adding that representatives of the trust then made \"scurrilous and defamatory allegations about how she obtained the money\".. Ms Herman has been regularly seen by Mr Woods' side in the past six years, including as he was recovering from a severe car accident that, it was initially feared, could end his golf career. . ",

        "content": "Tyler Vargas-Andrews: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability\". Tyler Vargas-Andrews spoke in the first of a series of Republican-led hearings examining the Biden administration's handling of the pull-out. . He detailed a period of chaos and unpreparedness in the days after the Taliban captured Kabul. . Others spoke of enduring trauma and the moral injury of abandoning allies.. Sgt Vargas-Andrews, 25, was one of several US military personnel tasked with protecting Kabul's airport on 26 August 2021, when two suicide bombers attacked crowds of Afghans trying to flee the Taliban during the US evacuation. . Thirteen US soldiers died in the bombing, along with 170 Afghan civilians. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews testified that he and another US Marine had received intelligence about the bombing before it occurred, and that he had spotted the suspect in the crowd. . He said he had alerted his supervisors and requested permission to act but had never received it. . \"Plain and simple, we were ignored,\" Sgt Vargas-Andrews said. . In emotional testimony, he described being thrown in the air during the bombing and opening his eyes to see his comrades dead or lying unconscious around him. . \"My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearings and shrapnel,\" he said. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews called the withdrawal a \"catastrophe\", adding: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability and negligence.\". \"I see the faces of all of those we could not save, those we left behind,\" he said.. The House Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into the evacuation from Afghanistan also heard from other US soldiers and veterans who spoke of the mental health toll that the withdrawal has had on them. . Retired Lt Col David Scott Mann, who worked to evacuate Afghans at the time, testified that the experience trying to get allies out had been \"gutting\". . He added that calls to the Veteran Affairs hotline spiked 81% after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and he warned that the US was on the \"front end of a mental health tsunami\". . He said a friend he had served with had died by suicide in the aftermath. . \"He just couldn't find his way out of the darkness of that moral injury,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Testimony from the majority of witnesses placed the blame on every presidential administration since US troops were first deployed to Afghanistan, from George W Bush to Joe Biden. . Witnesses also urged immediate action to help Afghan allies who are now in limbo both in Afghanistan and in the US. . \"America is building a nasty reputation for multi-generational systemic abandonment of our allies where we leave a smouldering human refuse, from the Montagnards of Vietnam to the Kurds in Syria,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Republicans who had long pushed for an investigation placed the blame on the Biden administration.. Panel chairman Mike McCaul, a House Republican from Texas, said the withdrawal had been a \"systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level, and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration\".. In response, Democrats spoke out in defence of President Biden. . Congressman Gregory Meeks from New York said that Mr Biden had \"made the right decision to bring all our troops home\". . \"I can't in good conscience imagine sending more American men and women to fight in Afghanistan.\". Mr Biden had previously said that he bore \"responsibility for fundamentally all that has happened\", but he also blamed former President Donald Trump for overseeing the withdrawal deal with the Taliban..

        "content": "Buildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.. Ukraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.. The military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones fired.. In western Ukraine, at least five people were killed in Lviv after a rocket hit their home, the region's governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.. Russian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.. While one person has died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the \"last link\" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last 10 days.. Russia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was \"a provocation\".. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was \"a difficult night\", after Russia resumed its \"miserable tactics\".. He said the energy system was being restored and all services were working after the \"massive\" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.. In Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.. Mr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.. A mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.. \"About 15\" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with \"critical infrastructure facilities\" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.. Other regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.. The attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when . .. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.. The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.. She said the war in Ukraine had become a \"grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage\".. \"We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,\" she said.. Ms Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional \"mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources\" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.. Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\".  in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently. . ",

It was valued at nearly $1.5m.. , 92.4% of home appraisers are white.. In 2021, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation released a study of 12 million appraisals over five years, showing that homes in black and Hispanic neighbourhoods were routinely undervalued.. Ms Tate-Austin and Mr Austin bought the house in 2016 in the San Francisco suburb of Marin City for about $550,000. . The city has a large African-American population (38%), compared with the predominantly white Marin County, where it is situated, in which only 2.8% of the population is black.. In 2020, when interest rates were historically low, the couple decided to refinance their mortgage.. The year before, a company had appraised their four-bedroom property for $1,450,000, after they made major improvements, including adding square-footage. . But when they decided to refinance again in 2020 to take advantage of low rates, they were appraised for just $995,000.. So they came up with an experiment. What if their friend, a white woman, posed as the homeowner instead? . They removed all trace of themselves from their home, including their African-themed artwork and their photographs. . The process is known as \"white-washing\", and black homeowners across the country have reported doing it in order to sell their properties.. Several weeks after their first estimate, a different appraiser toured the house for the decoy white homeowner. . This time, it was appraised at $1,482,500 - almost half a million dollars more than the initial estimate, . .. \"You feel a sense of relief like, 'I told you.' Then you just feel a sense of sadness,\" Ms Tate-Austin told the BBC's broadcast partner CBS News in 2021. . \"We had to do what we had to do in order to have our house appraised for what it should have appraised for from the start.. \"I mean, it's the financial impact, but it's the emotional impact. It's the feeling every day like, the tax of being African-American in this country, like you don't know, it's a coin toss.\" . The couple sued the first appraisal company for violating the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits housing discrimination.. The lawsuit was settled on Wednesday for an undisclosed amount. . As part of the agreement, the defendants do not have to admit any liability in the case, but will have to watch a documentary about discriminatory real estate and attend a training session on the history of racial discrimination in real estate..

The main ruling party said it was pulling the bill \"unconditionally\".. Describing itself as a party of government responsible to all members of society, Georgian Dream referred to the need to reduce \"confrontation\" in society.. Georgia has applied for candidate status of the European Union and sought to join Nato. EU officials had condemned the draft legislation as incompatible with EU values. .

Despite the decision to drop the bill, opposition parties said they had no plans to halt the protests. They called for clarity on how the proposals were to be withdrawn and demanded the release of protesters detained this week.. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili had earlier condemned the \"stir\" over the bill. His party maintained that the legislation mimicked American laws from the 1930s, an argument also used by the Kremlin when it passed a similar law in 2012.. That Russian law has gradually intensified and now suppresses Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers, who are required to label their content with the sinister phrase \"foreign agent\".. \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old protester Luka Kimeridze.. Eka Gigauri of Transparency International in Georgia told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information..
