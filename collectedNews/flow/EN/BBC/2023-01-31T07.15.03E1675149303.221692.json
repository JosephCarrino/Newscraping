        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. . However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's Chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Moscow has accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. . The French President, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday echoed this sentiment - saying that while \"nothing is excluded\" when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",

        "content": "Canada's federal government granted the request by the west coast province to try out the three-year experiment. . It follows a similar policy in the nearby US state of Oregon, which decriminalised hard drugs in 2020. . Ahead of the pilot's launch, British Columbia and federal officials outlined the rules under the federally approved exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.. While those substances will remain illegal, adults found in possession of a combined total of less than 2.5g of the drugs will not be arrested, charged or have their substances seized. Instead, they will be offered information on available health and social services.. Federal minister of mental health and addictions Carolyn Bennett on Monday called the move \"a monumental shift in drug policy that favours fostering trusting and supportive relationships in health and social services over further criminalisation\".. Some 10,000 residents have died from drug overdoses since British Columbia declared drugs to be a public health emergency in 2016, officials said. . This video can not be played. Vancouver's unusual approach offers opioid users injection sites, antidotes and even heroin on prescription.. \"Decriminalising people who use drugs breaks down the fear and shame associated with substance use and ensures they feel safer reaching out for life-saving supports,\" said Jennifer Whiteside, the British Columbia minister for mental health and addictions.. Thousands of police officers in the province have been offered training on the rule change, including those in Vancouver, the largest city in the province. . The programme will run from 31 January 2023 until 31 January 2026, unless it is revoked by the federal government.. Some experts have questioned the 2.5g limit, saying that it is not enough to account for the habits of many addicts. . There are some exemptions to the scheme.. The sale of drugs remains illegal. It is also illegal to possess drugs on the grounds of schools, childcare facilities and airports.. Canada legalised the use of recreational cannabis for adults nationwide in 2018.. But the four drugs now allowed in small quantities remain prohibited, meaning there are no plans to sell them in stores, unlike marijuana. Trafficking them across borders also remains illegal. . ",

        "content": "The court petition disputes a 2016 amendment to Lisa Marie's will that ousted Priscilla as the estate trustee. . The document misspelled her mother's name and had a signature that appeared unusual, Ms Presley's lawyers argue. . In a filing to the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for the 77-year-old said that she only became aware of the \"purported 2016 amendment\" after Lisa Marie's death. . The amendment in question removes her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaces them with her children Riley, 33, and Benjamin Keough. . Benjamin Keough died in 2020 at the age of 27. Riley Keough is an actress with credits including 2020 film The Devil All the Time and the Amazon series The Terminal List.. According to the legal challenge, Ms Presley argues that the amendment was never delivered to her during her daughter's lifetime, as specifically required by the will. . The amendment to Lisa Marie's will also \"misspells her mother's name\" and bears a signature by Lisa Marie that \"appears inconsistent with her usual and customary signature\", says the court filing seen by the BBC.. This video can not be played. Watch: Lisa Marie Presley - \"Music has been important for me my whole life\".

The legal action comes less than a week after the surviving family of Lisa Marie Presley attended a public memorial service for her at the family's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. . At the service, Priscilla read a poem that she said was written by one of Lisa Marie's three daughters. All three of them, including Riley, were present for the service. . Lisa Marie's cause of death has not yet been revealed by the Los Angeles County coroner. . ",

As part of the policy change in Sichuan, unmarried individuals will also now be able to raise children.. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.. In 2016, China scrapped its controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases even lost jobs. . In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy also led to forced abortions.. But the changes that began in 2016 failed to halt the decline in the birth rate. Deaths outnumbered births . Now, there will be no limit on the number of children people can have in Sichuan, a province of 80 million people in the south west of the country.. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made boosting birth rates a priority. The government has offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare to reverse or slow the falling rates. .

International criminal gangs now use sophisticated equipment to track and tranquilise the animals before hacking off the horn, leaving them bleeding to death.. Poaching in South Africa and Botswana has led to wildlife teams sawing off the rhino horns in order to keep them alive.  . For many generations rhino horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine despite there being no proven medical benefit. . Poaching is also being fuelled by demand in Vietnam, where horns are displayed as a sign of wealth.. The most endangered is the black rhino with just over 5,000 still alive..
