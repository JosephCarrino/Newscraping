        "content": "Russia's foreign minister accused the West of \"blackmail and threats\". . India had wanted to focus on other issues affecting developing nations, but it said the differences over Ukraine \"could not be reconciled\".. \"We tried, but the gap between the countries was too much,\" India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said.. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. The group's foreign ministers - including Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Antony Blinken of the US and China's Qin Gang - were meeting in Delhi under India's presidency. It was the first face-to-face meeting of the two top US and Russian diplomats since the war began, just over a year ago.. Mr Blinken met Mr Lavrov for about 10 minutes on the sidelines of the summit, and told him the West would stand by Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", a senior state department official said. Mr Blinken also pressed Russia to rejoin the New Start nuclear arms control treaty that it recently withdrew from and abide by the terms.. Russian officials denied any negotiations had taken place. Earlier, Russia also accused the West of \"burying\" a deal to allow some Ukrainian grain exports - but the US countered by saying Moscow was hampering Ukrainian exports.. Meanwhile Russian officials said Moscow and Beijing had agreed to oppose what they called Western blackmail and threats - but this hasn't been confirmed by China. . \"We speak about manners. Well, our Western counterparts have gotten really bad with these,\" Mr Lavrov said after Thursday's talks. \"They are not thinking of diplomacy any more; they now only deal in blackmail and threatening everyone else.\". Indian PM Narendra Modi had opened the session by speaking up for developing nations, saying those present had a responsibility to them.. \"We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,\" Mr Modi told the ministers gathered in Delhi, urging delegates to find common ground. . \"After years of progress, we are at risk today of moving back on the sustainable development goals. Many developing countries are struggling with unsustainable debts while trying to ensure food and energy security,\" he said.. \"They are also most affected by global warming caused by richer countries. This is why India's G20 presidency has tried to give a voice to the Global South.\". It was a rare address by Mr Modi in English - a sign of how seriously he wanted his message to be taken. He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions. . India's slogan for the G20 is \"One Earth, One Family, One Future\". Mr Modi called on delegates to take it to heart and focus on issues that unite them.  . Thursday's schedule included sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency. . Before the talks a former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make delegates overlook their differences on the war.  Indian diplomats worked towards a consensus on less politically contentious issues.. Foreign Minister Jaishankar presented a chair's summary after Thursday's talks, meaning participants had been unable to reach a joint statement. . \"There were issues and very frankly they were concerned with the Ukraine conflict. There were divergences,\" he said, noting the \"polarised views of some countries, we were not able to bridge on this occasion.\". Last week, G20 finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on a closing statement at their meeting in the city of Bangalore (Bengaluru), in the first ministerial meeting in the run-up to the leaders' summit later this year. . Strained relations between the US and China, which has refused to oppose Russia's invasion, were also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.. Experts say Delhi also has the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together. . India has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. It has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of more than a billion people.  . But it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "A UN official said their submissions were \"irrelevant\" and \"tangential\" to the issues being discussed.. Self-styled guru Nithyananda is wanted in India in several cases, including rape and sexual assault.. Nithyananda, who claims he founded the United States of Kailasa (USK) in 2019, has denied the allegations against him.. USK's appearance at the UN events last week had made headlines in India. The Indian government hasn't publicly commented on the matter yet. . A UN official told the BBC in an email that \"USK representatives attended two UN public meetings in Geneva in February\". . The first was a discussion on the representation of women in decision-making systems, organised by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 22 February. USK representatives also participated in a second discussion on sustainable development, hosted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), on 24 February.. These general discussions are public meetings open to anyone who is interested, said Vivian Kwok, a media officer at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which oversees the two committees.. Ms Kwok said USK's written submission to CEDAW would not be included in their report as it was \"irrelevant to the topic of the general discussion\".. She also said that a statement made by a USK representative at the second discussion would not be taken into consideration as its focus \"was tangential to the topic at hand\".. A video on the UN website of the second session shows that when questions are invited from attendees, a woman introduces herself as Vijayapriya Nithyananda, \"the permanent ambassador of the United States of Kailasa\" and says she wants to ask a question about \"indigenous rights and sustainable development\".. She describes USK as the \"first sovereign state for Hindus\" established by Nithyananda, the \"supreme pontiff of Hinduism\". She also claims that USK has been \"successful with sustainable development\" because it provided necessities such as food, shelter and medical care for free to all its citizens. Her question is regarding what measures can be put in place to \"stop the persecution\" of Nithyananda and the people of Kailasa. . Others who asked questions at the discussion included a representative of an organisation called One Ocean Hub and a lecturer at Essex University.. Former Indian diplomat Preeti Saran, who holds the Asia Pacific seat at CESCR, was among the attendees at the discussion. The BBC has emailed her for comment.. Nithyananda, who was facing charges of rape, fled India in 2019. A female disciple had accused him of rape in 2010, after which he was briefly arrested before getting bail. He was charged in court in 2018.. Days before he left the country, a separate police complaint had also accused him of kidnapping and confining children at his ashram in the western state of Gujarat. . It's unclear where he escaped to and how he reached there. . That same year, he claimed to have bought an island off the coast of Ecuador and founded a new country called Kailasa, named after a mountain in the Himalayas that is considered the abode of the Hindu god Shiva. . At the time, Ecuador denied that he was in the country, and said that \"Nithyananda has not been given asylum by Ecuador or has been helped by the government of Ecuador\".. Nithyananda has not made any public appearances since 2019, though videos of his sermons are regularly released on his social media channels. .  reported last year that Nithyananda's UK representative had attended \"a glamorous Diwali party at the House of Lords\" on the invitation of two Conservative members.. News of the UN event began circulating on Indian social media after Nithyananda's Twitter account tweeted a photo of Vijayapriya Nithyananda.. A tweet thread later appeared to introduce USK's ambassadors to different parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and the Caribbean. . According to its website, Kailasa counts \"two billion practising Hindus\" among its population. It also claims to have a flag, a constitution, a central bank, a passport and an emblem.. ",

        "content": "About 300 black residents of Greenwood - a prosperous town then known as \"Black Wall Street\" - were murdered and their homes and businesses destroyed by a mob of white people.. The citizenship ceremony took place at Ghana's embassy in Washington DC. . Ms Fletcher, known as Mother Fletcher, and Mr Van Ellis, also called Uncle Red, visited Ghana in August 2021 as part of a week-long tour of Africa to mark the centenary of the killings, known as the Tulsa race massacre. . The pair will become dual citizens, the Washington Post reports, citing comments made at the ceremony by Hajia Alima Mahama, Ghana's US ambassador.. The Justice for Greenwood Foundation, which works with survivors of the massacre and their descendants, said the pair have become the oldest African-Americans to be granted citizenship of Ghana. . The foundation said it was \"proud to stand in solidarity with the survivors, celebrating their resilience and their contribution to the history\" of black Oklahoma. . Rocky Dawuni, a Ghanaian singer-songwriter, posed with a photo of Ms Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis at the citizenship ceremony, calling it a \"historic day\". . During their 2021 visit, Ms Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis were both granted royal Ghanaian names, and met President Nana Akufo-Addo, who had invited members of the African diaspora to visit Ghana . , commemorating 400 years since the first African slaves were said to have arrived in the US. . \"This country is your country, and anyone who wants to come to re-establish, connect with us here, is welcome,\" Mr Akufo-Addo said in 2021. . Ghana was a key transit point for transporting slaves and the president said his country felt a responsibility to welcome all those who could trace their ancestry to Africa. The initiative was also aimed at boosting Ghana's economy, particularly tourism, as well as its international image.. The country attracted a number of celebrities in 2019, including model Naomi Campbell, actor Idris Elba, comedian Steve Harvey and American rapper Cardi B.. This video can not be played. In 1921 Tulsa saw one of the biggest race massacres in American history.. More than 100 years after it took place, the Tulsa massacre remains one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history.. Against a backdrop of racial segregation, Ku Klux Klan rallies and lynchings, on 31 May 1921 armed white mobs went on the rampage in the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood after a black man was accused of assaulting a white woman. . An estimated 300 black people were killed, and the Greenwood district devastated beyond recognition.. For decades the story of the massacre was largely erased from history, but was thrust into the spotlight in 2020 when then-President Donald Trump announced he would hold an election rally in Tulsa on 19 June. The day is celebrated by many African-Americans as Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery. . Occurring in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, which triggered nationwide protests about racial injustice, Mr Trump moved his rally to a day later.. ",
