        "content": "Their lawyers claimed they were simply bumbling extremists with no clear plan. . But prosecutors said the gang was hoping to violently overthrow the government.. All three were found guilty of conspiring to prepare an act of terrorism. . Jean-Pierre Bouyer, 66, was handed the longest sentence of four years in prison, with one year suspended, far below the 10-year maximum jail term.. Two others were handed shorter prison terms.. A fourth man was given a six-month suspended sentence for possessing a weapon.. All were arrested in the eastern Moselle region. Police found a commando-style knife and an army vest in Bouyer's car and guns were later found at his home.. Nine other members of the group were cleared. . During the trial, the court heard about racist online conversations in which they discussed migration, their fear about civil war, and their hatred of Mr Macron.. In one conversation, a mother of three boasted about her ability to storm the presidential palace with the help of 500 Russian soldiers.. The group were also suspected of plotting attacks against mosques and migrants.. \"I was so furious, so angry that I might have said that,\" one defendant, a 55-year-old woman, told the court when asked about an idea of kidnapping and burning Muslims.. The chief prosecutor called the group an \"incubator of violent action\", and while some of their views could appear \"eccentric\", the \"threat was real\". . But defence lawyers said the group were marginalised people from the countryside, all supporters of the anti-government Yellow Vest movement. One lawyer accepted there was \"hatred\" expressed by some in the group, but said that it was driven by \"social distress\". .

        "content": "France's Emmanuel Macron also said now was not the time for dialogue with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.. The event is an annual gathering of leaders, officials and diplomats; its focus this year is transatlantic. . US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are attending with a large congressional delegation, alongside almost 30 European heads of government. . At the conference, Mr Scholz said it was \"wise to prepare for a long war\" and show Russian President Vladimir Putin that Germany and its allies would not give up on Ukraine. . Ukrainian officials have said they are urgently in need of heavier weapons, and that sufficient battle tanks could help Kyiv's forces seize back territory from the Russians.. Germany - who in recent months came under growing pressure over its apparent hesitation to send weapons to Ukraine - . .. It also allowed other countries to send their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine - which was restricted until now under export regulations.. Mr Macron said the next few weeks would be decisive, adding allies needed to \"intensify our support\" for Ukraine to be able to launch a counter-offensive, so later the country could enter negotiations in a position of strength.. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to assembled leaders via video link, urged allies to speed up the supply of weapons, warning there was no alternative to victory over Moscow.. No Russian officials have been invited. . The agenda is broad - from China to climate change - but the conference will give Ukraine's allies a chance to assess Russia's invasion almost one year on. . There will be warm words of support for Kyiv. But there will also be questions about the extent and duration of Western resolve as economic pressures grow.. ",
