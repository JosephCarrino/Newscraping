        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. . \"Today's loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,\" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).. Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Mr Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "Human rights groups have accused China of using the stations to threaten and monitor Chinese nationals abroad..  China has denied running the stations, calling them \"service centres\" for its nationals overseas.. Speaking to media on Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said they are an issue that his government is \"very concerned about\". . \"We're in the process of making sure the RCMP is following up on this and that our intelligence systems are taking this seriously,\" he said.. The stations are believed to be among at least 100 operating across the globe in 53 countries, including the UK and the US, according to Spain-based NGO Safeguard Defenders, which monitors disappearances in China. . In a report last year, the non-profit said the stations are part of efforts by China's regime to \"harass, threaten, intimidate and force targets to return to China for persecution\". . It said Chinese public security bureaus established the \"overseas police service stations\" in several continents, including two in London and one in Glasgow. In North America, it found stations in Toronto, Vancouver and in New York.. Last November the RCMP confirmed they were investigating reports of such service stations operating in the Greater Toronto Area.. On Thursday, the federal force asked Chinese Canadians who may have been targeted by what police called \"alleged Chinese police stations\" to come forward. . \"These activities and any other form of intimidation, harassment or targeting of diaspora communities or individuals in Canada will not be tolerated,\" said RCMP Sgt Charles Poirier on Thursday. . Federal police in the US have previously expressed concern with similar reports of such stations operating in the country. . FBI director Christopher Wray told a US Senate hearing in November that attempts by China to set up a police presence on US soil \"violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes\".. Safeguard Defenders reported that an alleged Chinese police station has been set up on Broadway in New York City. . Chinese embassies in the US and Canada have said the locations are \"overseas service stations'' opened during the pandemic to assist nationals abroad with driver's licence renewal and similar matters.. But Jing-Jie Chen, a researcher with Safeguard Defenders, told the BBC he was sceptical of China's explanation. . \"If you really do want to support your nationals abroad, you can use official channels, you do not have to do this undercover,\" he said. . The RCMP probe comes amid allegations that China attempted to interfere in Canada's two last federal elections, reports which have strained relations between the two countries. . ",

        "content": "There are fears the vessel could soon break apart or explode, risking one of the worst oil spills in recent memory.. But on Thursday, the UN said it had purchased a crude carrier that would head to Yemen and remove the oil from the stricken ship.. \"The purchase of this suitable vessel... marks the beginning of the operational phase of the plan to safely remove the oil and avoid the risk of an environmental and humanitarian disaster,\" Achim Steiner from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said, adding that it was a \"major breakthrough\"..  said the ship - which it purchased from major tanker company Euronav - was undergoing routine maintenance in China and would arrive for the operation in early May.. \"A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen's Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions,\" it said.. The organisation added that a potential oil spill could cost up to $20bn (¬£16.7bn) to clean up.. The UN had been searching for years for a solution and appealed for donations. The planned operation is estimated to cost $129m of which $75m has been received and another $20m has been pledged, it said.. The stranded ship - the FSO Safer - was left abandoned off the port of Hodeida after Yemen's civil war broke out in 2015. It has not been serviced since.. It was constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and converted later into a floating storage for oil. It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.. The 376m (1,233ft) vessel holds an estimated 1.14m barrels of crude oil.. The Safer's structural integrity has deteriorated significantly since maintenance operations were suspended in 2015, when the Houthis seized large parts of Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government. The ensuing conflict has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left more than 23 million in need of aid.. Mr Steiner told reporters on Thursday: \"Let me be very clear - this is a risky operation and things could go wrong.\" He added that it could still be suspended if they fail to raise enough funds..
