        "content": "Watch: Teddy bears rain down on football pitch for earthquake victims. On a visit to Adiyaman, Mr Erdogan said the tremors and bad weather meant \"we could not work as we would have liked\". \"For this, I ask forgiveness,\" he said.. More than 50,000 people are known to have been killed in Turkey and Syria after huge earthquakes on 6 February.. A new, smaller quake has hit Turkey.. It killed at least one person and injured more than 100 people in Malatya province, north of Adiyaman. Search and rescue teams were trying to find several people believed to be trapped under collapsed buildings.. There have been four new earthquakes and 45 aftershocks of magnitudes 5-6 since the two massive quakes on 6 February, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD).. AFAD chief Orhan Tatar described it as \"very extraordinary activity\".. The World Bank says the 6 February quakes caused about $34bn (£28bn) of direct damage in Turkey, but the cost of reconstruction could be about twice that figure. Meanwhile World Bank official Anna Bjerde said the situation in Syria was \"really catastrophic\".. Mr Erdogan - who is seeking re-election as president in polls to be held by June - has been touring some of the worst-hit areas. His visit to Adiyaman came after strong criticism of the emergency response there from local people.. \"I did not see anyone until 2:00 pm on the second day of the earthquake,\" Adiyaman resident Mehmet Yildirim told AFP earlier this month. . \"No government, no state, no police, no soldiers. Shame on you! You left us on our own.\". The disaster left 1.5 million people homeless and many thousands of people remain without shelter or sanitation. There are shortages of tents for survivors.. Discontent has spread around the country, with football fans singing \"government resign\" at matches this weekend.. Fans of Besiktas in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul threw thousands of soft toys onto the pitch, to be distributed to children affected by the earthquake.. Meanwhile riot police detained protesters at a demonstration in Istanbul.. More than 160,000 buildings containing 520,000 apartments collapsed or were badly damaged on 6 February.. The government says hundreds of people are under investigation and nearly 200 people - including construction contractors and property owners - have already been arrested.. Experts had warned for years that endemic corruption and government policies meant many new buildings were unsafe.. In Adiyaman, Mr Erdogan vowed to build more than 500,000 new homes along with infrastructure, medical centres and parks.. Turkey is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections by June. Mr Erdogan is seeking another term as president after 20 years in power.. ",

        "content": "The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education.. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis.. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World.. \"There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\". For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department.. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 square miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year.. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state.. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes.. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (£41,467) to Mr DeSantis' re-election campaign.. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed.. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\".. Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.. Friction between Disney, one of the world's biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April.. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under.. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content.. DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power.. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that's happened over the past couple of years, I've always been very proud of our parks,\" he said.. \"It's almost like a right of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you've got to have people who can tell you the truth.\".

        "content": "This is the first national election where an electronic device has been used to accredit voters.. The election commission has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. The PDP representative at the election centre in Abuja described the process as fraudulent, and accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec, while the Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC, whose candidate Bola Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. With about a third of the 36 states officially declared, Mr Tinubu has 44% of votes cast, ahead of Mr Abubakar on 33%, and Mr Obi on 18%. However, many of the results yet to come are from the north and south-east, seen as strongholds of the PDP and Labour Party respectively, so the final outcome remains unpredictable.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 but this time, Mr Obi from the previously little known Labour Party is expected to mount a strong challenge to the two-party system. He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. Mr Obi has caused a major upset by winning in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, narrowly defeating Mr Tinubu in his heartland.. Mr Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and hopes to use his record there as the basis of his presidential bid.. The ruling party candidate has accepted defeat in Lagos and said that as a democrat, he was bound to accept the outcome of any election.. \"People have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice,\" he said in a statement released by his campaign team.. He also appealed for calm from his supporters after his loss, following reports of violence in parts of Lagos against traders from the Igbo community, like Mr Obi.. Mr Obi's victory in Lagos, though a major breakthrough for a third-party candidate, is not necessarily a huge surprise. The city is home to many young, educated people, as well as a large Igbo population - all groups widely seen as backing his campaign.. He has also won in his heartland eastern Enugu state.. Inec had assured Nigerians that the electronic voting system, known as Bvas, would enable it to transmit election results direct from polling stations to improve transparency.. However, there were complaints on Saturday from many voters that electoral officials refused to upload the results at the polling stations as they are supposed to.. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results.. Inec chairman Mr Yakubu has apologised for the inability of the commission to upload most of the results as promised, saying that a surge in traffic caused glitches.. ",

Last year, more than 200 tonnes of the drug were seized in the Andean country, much of it in the port of Guayaquil.. With Ecuador the world's largest exporter of bananas, smugglers often try to hide their illegal consignments among the fruit which is shipped from Guayaquil to destinations all over the globe. . This latest haul was found inside a container full of banana cases destined for Belgium.. The seizure coincides with a visit by Belgium's Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson to Ecuador and Colombia.. The two officials want to strengthen cooperation with the two South American nations in the fight against drug trafficking.. Belgium has become the country where the largest quantities of cocaine have been seized within the European Union in recent years, with the port of Antwerp the main entry point for the illegal drug.. The director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Alexis Gosdeel, said earlier this month that the \"growing flow of cocaine now threatens the entire European Union\". . \"I am deeply concerned that the expanding EU cocaine market is bringing a rise in violence and corruption on public institutions and governance,\" he warned. . In Ecuador, violence linked to drug smuggling has skyrocketed as powerful Mexican cartels have infiltrated local gangs to gain control of the lucrative business.. Prisons are overflowing and fights between rival gangs behind bars have left scores dead.. ",

Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. The airline said: \"Safety of the passengers and crew remain Wizz Air's number one priority.... \"Following the recent developments in Moldova and the elevated, but not imminent, risk in the country's airspace, Wizz Air has made the difficult but responsible decision to suspend all flights to Chisinau from 14 March.\".

The authority said it would take \"all necessary actions\" to return Wizz Air to Chisinau airport as soon as possible, and to attract other low-cost airlines..
