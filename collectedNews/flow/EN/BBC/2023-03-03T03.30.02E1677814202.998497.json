        "content": "Naegleria fowleri infects the brain through the nose. Officials say that drinking it is not dangerous. . Infections are almost always fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).. Officials have not identified the victim.. On 23 February, the Florida Department of Heath said that a patient had been infected \"possibly as a result of sinus rinse practices\" utilising tap water.. On Thursday, a spokesman for the state health agency confirmed that the patient had died. . Officials across multiple government agencies are \"continuing to investigate how this infection occurred,\" spokesman Jae Williams said.. He added that officials are \"working with the local public utilities to identify any potential links and make any necessary corrective actions\".. The amoeba typically lives in warm fresh water such as swimming pools, lakes and ponds. . It can lead to a severe infection if it enters through the nose, but it is normally safe through the mouth because stomach acid kills the single-cell microorganism. . People who are infected contract a disease called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. . Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, a stiff neck, a loss of balance, seizures and/or hallucinations.. According to the CDC, around three Americans get infected each year, often with deadly consequences.. Between 1962 and 2021, only four of the 154 people infected in the US survived. . CDC data suggests infection in winter months is incredibly rare.. Officials warn that to avoid infections people should not rinse out their nasal passages with untreated tap water. . Sterile or distilled water are preferred options. Tap water can also be used if it is boiled for at least one minute and cooled before use. . People are also advised to avoid taking on water in their nose while in swimming pools or bathing or showering. . ",

        "content": "The officials say it could have been created to redistribute the pyramid's weight around the entrance or another as yet undiscovered chamber.. It was first detected in 2016 using an imaging technique called muography.. , which are by-products of cosmic rays that are only partially absorbed by stone. . The non-invasive technique detected an empty space behind the northern face of the Great Pyramid, about 7m above the main entrance, in an area where there is a stone chevron structure.. Further tests were carried out with radar and ultrasound before a 6mm-wide (0.24in) endoscope was fed through a tiny joint in-between the stones that make up the chevrons.. The footage from the camera was unveiled at a news conference beside the pyramid on Thursday. It showed an empty corridor with walls made out of roughly-hewn stone blocks and a vaulted stone ceiling.. \"We're going to continue our scanning so we will see what we can do... to figure out what we can find out beneath it, or just by the end of this corridor,\" said Mostafa Waziri, head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.. The Great Pyramid, which is 146m high, was built on the Giza plateau during the fourth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops, who reigned from around 2609BC to 2584BC.. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there is no consensus about how it was built.. Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass said the corridor represented a \"major discovery\" that would \"enter houses and homes of people all over the world for the first time\".. He also said that it might help reveal whether the burial chamber of King Khufu still existed inside the pyramid.. He speculated that there might be \"something important\" in the space below the corridor, then added: \"I'm sure in a few months from now we can see if what I'm saying is correct or not.\". . It is estimated to be 30m long and several metres in height and is located directly above the Grand Gallery.. ",

        "content": "'Bike desks' attempt to combat obesity in Mexico. More than four billion people will be affected, with rates rising fastest among children, its report says.  . Low or middle-income countries in Africa and Asia are expected to see the greatest rises. . The report predicts the cost of obesity will amount to more than $4tn (Â£3.3tn) annually by 2035.. The president of the federation, Prof Louise Baur, described the report's findings as a clear warning to countries to act now or risk repercussions in the future.. The .  in particular highlights the rising rates of obesity among children and teenagers, with rates expected to double from 2020 levels among both boys and girls.. Prof Baur said the trend was \"particularly worrying\", adding that \"governments and policymakers around the world need to do all they can to avoid passing health, social, and economic costs on to the younger generation\" by assessing \"the systems and root factors\" that contribute to obesity.. The effects of obesity's prevalence on lower-income countries is also highlighted in the report. Nine of the 10 countries with the greatest expected increases in obesity globally are low or lower-middle income states in Africa and Asia.. Reasons include trends in dietary preferences towards more highly processed foods, greater levels of sedentary behaviour, weaker policies to control food supply and marketing, and less well-resourced healthcare services to assist in weight management and health education.. Lower-income countries are \"often the least able to respond to obesity and its consequences\".. The findings estimate that rises in obesity rates around the world will have a significant impact on the global economy, equating to 3% of global Gross Domestic Product.. The report emphasises that its acknowledgement of the economic impact of obesity \"is in no way a reflection of blame on people living with obesity\".. The data published in the report will be presented to the UN on Monday.. Obese is a medical term used to describe a person with a high excess of body fat.. The report uses body mass index (BMI) to make its assessments. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height.. ",
