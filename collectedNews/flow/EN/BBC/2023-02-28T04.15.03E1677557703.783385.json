        "content": "\"The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions\", Mr Zelensky stated.. The Ukrainian leader's remarks came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China against arming Russia during a visit to Kyiv on Monday.. Some of the fiercest fighting to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a year ago has taken place in Bakhmut, in Ukraine's Donetsk region, part of which is under the control of Russia and its separatist allies.. Recently efforts by Russian forces to capture the industrial city have intensified, with its troops gaining ground.. The separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, said \"practically all roads\" into the city were \"under [Russian] fire control\".. Speaking about the situation in his nightly address, President Zelensky said managing to gain a foothold in Bakhmut and ensuring its defence were being heavily compromised by Russia's renewed onslaught.. He was \"grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding\" the area.. President Zelensky also called once again for modern combat aircraft to be sent so that \"the entire territory of our country\" can be defended from \"Russian terror\".. On her surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, Janet Yellen announced the latest transfer of $1.25bn (£1bn) in economic and budget aid to Ukraine.. Ms Yellen reiterated US President Joe Biden's message - made during .  - that Washington would stand with Ukraine for as long as it took to win the war.. , Ms Yellen added that while Russia's economy had not yet buckled under the vast sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers, she expected it to grow weaker over time.. She also stated that Russia's ability to replenish military equipment destroyed in attacks on Ukraine was being \"gradually jeopardized\", adding that any move from China to supply such weaponry to Russia would lead to \"severe\" consequences.. \"We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,\" she said. . \"And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.\". Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said . . Beijing strongly denied the claim.. A meeting between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week looked to many to be an indication of China's close ties with Russia..

        "content": "The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education.. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis.. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World.. \"There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\". For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department.. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 square miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year.. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state.. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes.. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (£41,467) to Mr DeSantis' re-election campaign.. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed.. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\".. Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.. Friction between Disney, one of the world's biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April.. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under.. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content.. DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power.. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that's happened over the past couple of years, I've always been very proud of our parks,\" he said.. \"It's almost like a right of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you've got to have people who can tell you the truth.\".

        "content": "China's foreign ministry hit back that the global outbreak's origin \"was about science and should not be politicised\".. Washington-Beijing ties have been under strain since the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon this month.. Ambassador Nicholas Burns told a US Chamber of Commerce event on Monday that China needs to \"be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis\".. US media reported on Sunday that a report from the US Department of Energy had concluded in a classified intelligence report with \"low confidence\" that the virus was accidentally leaked by a laboratory. . The energy department had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.. Other US agencies have drawn differing conclusions, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings. The FBI in 2021 concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that the virus leaked from a lab. . Other studies suggest it made the leap from animals to humans at Wuhan's Huanan seafood and wildlife market.. An .  released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday there was still no firm finding either way.. \"There has not been a definitive conclusion and consensus in the US government on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" he told reporters when asked about the energy department's reported determination.. A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry on Monday again rejected the lab leak theory.. Mao Ning called on US investigators to \"stop smearing China and stop politicising origins-tracing\".. After it was reported that the US energy department had settled on the lab leak theory, Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted \"being proven right doesn't matter\". . \"What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn't happen again.\". Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton told CNN he was \"not entirely surprised\" by the energy department's reported conclusion. . \"The Chinese have mishandled Covid at every step of the way, [and] are trying to sweep it under the rug,\" he said.. This video can not be played. Scientists believe another pandemic will happen during our lifetime. ",

        "content": "This is the first national election where an electronic device has been used to accredit voters.. The election commission has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. The PDP representative at the election centre in Abuja described the process as fraudulent, and accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec, while the Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC, whose candidate Bola Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. With about a third of the 36 states officially declared, Mr Tinubu has 44% of votes cast, ahead of Mr Abubakar on 33%, and Mr Obi on 18%. However, many of the results yet to come are from the north and south-east, seen as strongholds of the PDP and Labour Party respectively, so the final outcome remains unpredictable.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 but this time, Mr Obi from the previously little known Labour Party is expected to mount a strong challenge to the two-party system. He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. Mr Obi has caused a major upset by winning in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, narrowly defeating Mr Tinubu in his heartland.. Mr Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and hopes to use his record there as the basis of his presidential bid.. The ruling party candidate has accepted defeat in Lagos and said that as a democrat, he was bound to accept the outcome of any election.. \"People have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice,\" he said in a statement released by his campaign team.. He also appealed for calm from his supporters after his loss, following reports of violence in parts of Lagos against traders from the Igbo community, like Mr Obi.. Mr Obi's victory in Lagos, though a major breakthrough for a third-party candidate, is not necessarily a huge surprise. The city is home to many young, educated people, as well as a large Igbo population - all groups widely seen as backing his campaign.. He has also won in his heartland eastern Enugu state.. Inec had assured Nigerians that the electronic voting system, known as Bvas, would enable it to transmit election results direct from polling stations to improve transparency.. However, there were complaints on Saturday from many voters that electoral officials refused to upload the results at the polling stations as they are supposed to.. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results.. Inec chairman Mr Yakubu has apologised for the inability of the commission to upload most of the results as promised, saying that a surge in traffic caused glitches.. ",

There was an exchange of fire with police before the attackers fled, the IDF tweeted.. There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any Palestinian groups. . Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip but is less prominent in the West Bank, said the attack was a natural response to Israeli attacks.. \"The crimes conducted by the occupation and the herds of settlers will not be met but with stabbing, shooting and car ramming,\" a spokesman said in a statement.. The violence came after Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a . Videos posted hours after the summit ended on Sunday showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara on Sunday night. . This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\".. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis.. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don't take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement.. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles south of Nablus.. The brothers were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times.. No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions' Den.. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in .  in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005.. Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians.. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 14 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. More than 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. . Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.. ",

At least 63 migrants are confirmed to have died, with 12 children including a baby said to be among the victims.. The vessel, thought to have carried some 200 people, broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday.. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has urged EU institutions to take action to stop clandestine migrant boat journeys.. On board the boat, which had set out from Turkey a few days earlier, were said to be people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.. Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region. . The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for..

Prime Minister Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - on Monday said the only way to tackle the issue of migrant departures \"seriously\" and \"with humanity\" was to stop migrant boat journeys.. Speaking to Italian public broadcaster Rai 1, she said she had written to the European Council and European Commission calling for immediate action to stop migrant boat departures in order to prevent more deaths.. \"The more people depart, the more risk dying,\" she said..
