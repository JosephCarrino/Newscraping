        "content": "Three airports were shut and airspace was closed off the coast of North and South Carolina as the military carried out the operation on Saturday.. Footage from the AP news agency showed the balloon falling to the sea after a small explosion.. US President Joe Biden has been under pressure to shoot the balloon down since it first appeared in its airspace last week.. According to a statement from the Pentagon, on Wednesday Mr Biden approved the plan to take down the \"surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon's path\". . Officials had advised him against targeting the object while it was over land due to the danger of falling debris.. Earlier on Saturday, President Biden told reporters he would \"take care of it\" in answer to a question about what would happen to the high-altitude craft.. The balloon's arrival over the US comes amid fraying tensions between Washington and Beijing, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling off a trip to Beijing over the matter.. Mr Blinken said the \"surveillance\" balloon's presence was \"an irresponsible act\". However, China - which says it is a weather ship blown astray - has urged \"cool-headed\" handling of the dispute.. Earlier, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it had paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast on Saturday because of a \"national security effort\". . The coast guard had also advised mariners to leave the area due to military operations \"that present a significant hazard\".. This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. China sought to play down the cancellation of Mr Blinken's visit over the balloon on Saturday, saying that neither side had formally announced a plan for a trip. . China's foreign ministry said in a statement that Beijing \"would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype\" and accused \"some politicians and media in the United States\" of using the incident \"as a pretext to attack and smear China.\". According to US officials, the balloon floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.. The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken telling Beijing the balloon's presence was \"a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law\" and \"an irresponsible act\" on the eve of his visit to China.. America's top diplomat had been set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. It would have been the first high-level US-China meeting there in years.. But plans faltered after American defence officials announced they were tracking a giant surveillance balloon over the US on Thursday.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. And late on Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. China has so far made no public comments on the reported second balloon.. ",

        "content": "The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said his \"heart breaks with sorrow\" over continued violence there.. South Sudan has been wracked by civil war since becoming independent in 2011.. Despite a peace deal in 2018, violence driven by ethnic tensions has continued - more than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict.. At least 20 people were killed in a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit.. On the first full day of his visit, Pope Francis met hundreds of South Sudan's religious leaders at the Cathedral of Saint Therese in the capital Juba. . During his address, he urged them not to remain neutral, and instead speak up against \"the injustice and the abuses of power that oppress\".. \"If we want to be pastors who intercede, we cannot remain neutral before the pain caused by acts of injustice and violence. To violate the fundamental rights of any woman or man is an offence against Christ.\". Elsewhere in Juba on Saturday, Archbishop Justin Welby said: \"My heart breaks, I can hardly speak, with sorrow for South Sudan.\". \"I beg that at every level, from the president to the smallest child, that people find the mercy of God and are transformed, and that there is peace and good government. That no-one steals money. That no-one kills their neighbour for cattle,\" .  at the All Saints Anglican Cathedral.. It is Pope Francis' first papal visit to the country. . In 2019, a year after a peace deal failed to stem political and ethnic unrest, Pope Francis shocked many by kissing the feet of South Sudan's bitter political rivals, President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, when they met at the Vatican - asking them to respect the terms of the ceasefire.. But the violence has continued - and Pope Francis, Justin Welby and Church of Scotland Moderator Iain Greenshields have been hearing from some of the two million people displaced by the conflict as part of their peace mission. They heard testimonies from displaced children at a meeting in Juba on Saturday, many of whom had been on the run from violence for most of their lives.. According to Reuters, the Pope was told by a nun at the Cathedral of Saint Therese how two of her fellow sisters were killed in an ambush in Juba in 2021.. The three Christian leaders also led thousands of people in a joint prayer on Saturday evening at the mausoleum of John Garang, South Sudan's founding father. . On Sunday, the Pope will celebrate Mass outdoors, which is expected to draw large crowds.. ",

        "content": "Mr Arai also warned that permitting gay marriage in Japan would lead to many abandoning the country.. Mr Kishida said the remarks were \"outrageous\" and \"completely incompatible\" with his government's policies.. Japan - a country still largely bound by traditional gender roles and family values - is the only G7 nation that does not recognise same-sex marriage.. However, recent polling suggests most Japanese support gay marriage.. A number of same-sex couples have also filed lawsuits across Japan in recent years arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage violates the country's constitution.. Prior to Mr Arai's dismissal, Mr Kishida had talked about issues surrounding same-sex marriage in parliament.. He stated that it needed to be carefully considered because of its potential impact on traditional family structures.. Mr Arai reacted to the remarks afterwards, telling reporters that he \"wouldn't like it if [LGBT couples] lived next door\" and \"doesn't even want to look at them.\". He added that it would \"change the way society is\" and \"quite a few people would abandon this country,\" according to Kyodo News.. In response, Mr Kishida said he had dismissed Mr Arai, adding: \"We have been respecting diversity and realising an inclusive society.\". Mr Arai later apologised, stating that his remarks were not appropriate and were not representative of the prime minister's views.. His resignation represents a further blow to Mr Kishida, whose government has seen plummeting approval ratings after a number of his ministers have resigned over various scandals in recent months..
