        "content": "But Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his army's lack of ammunition could be \"ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal\".. Ukraine's president and military commanders have agreed to strengthen their defence of Bakhmut. . Russia has appeared determined to capture the city for months, but many analysts say it has become a symbolic prize in the war and has little strategic value.. An apparent rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular Russian army seems to have intensified in recent weeks, and this is not the first time Mr Prigozhin . . . In a social media post on Sunday, Mr Prigozhin said documents had been signed on 22 February, with ammunition expected to be sent to Bakhmut the next day.. But most had not been shipped, he said, before suggesting it could be deliberate.. And in a further sign of the rift, on Monday Mr Prigozhin said his representative was unable to access the headquarters of Russia's military command. It is unclear where the headquarters is located. . Mr Prigozhin said it came after he wrote to the chief of Russia's \"special military operation\", Valery Gerasimov, about the \"urgent necessity to give us ammunition\".. Separately, in a video uploaded on Saturday - but seemingly filmed in February - Mr Prigozhin said his men feared that they were being \"set up\" as scapegoats in case Russia lost its war in Ukraine. . \"If we step back, we will go down in history as the people who took the main step to lose the war,\" he said.. \"And this is precisely the problem with the shell hunger [ammunition shortage]. This is not my opinion, but that of ordinary fighters... . \"What if they [the Russian authorities] want to set us up, saying that we are scoundrels - and that's why they are not giving us ammunition, not giving us weapons, and not letting us replenish our personnel, including [recruiting] prisoners?\". In Saturday's video, Mr Prigozhin also said Russia's front line would collapse without his troops.. He suggested Wagner fighters were taking on the \"entire Ukrainian army... destroying it\" and depriving it of the chance to concentrate on other parts of the front.. Ukraine's troops were probably conducting a \"limited fighting withdrawal\" in eastern Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday. . But it added Ukraine was .  on Russian forces.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country's military commanders supported continuing operations to defend and strengthen positions in Bakhmut. . In a statement, President Zelensky's office said he had held a meeting with Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the country's ground forces.. They spoke \"in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut\". . On Saturday, the deputy mayor of Bakhmut told the BBC that there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.. However Oleksandr Marchenko said Russian troops had not yet gained control.. \"They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,\" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.. Separately, Moscow's Mr Shoigu has visited the occupied city of Mariupol during a trip to eastern Ukraine - a year after his troops besieged the city. . The defence ministry said he was inspecting work carried out to \"restore infrastructure in the Donbas\" - words that are likely to grate in Ukraine, given Russia's responsibility for the destruction..

        "content": "Officials on both sides hailed the proposal as a breakthrough on Monday.. But victims and opponents of the plan in South Korea have criticised the agreement, saying it does not hold Japan accountable.. About 150,000 Koreans were forced to work in factories and mines in Japan in the war, due to Japan's colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945.. On Monday, protesters in Seoul held demonstrations outside South Korea's foreign ministry to condemn the plan by their government, which will see South Korean companies pay into a public fund for victims.. Meanwhile, Japan's government welcomed Seoul's move away from demanding two Japanese firms pay compensation. Previous South Korean governments had attempted to make Tokyo pay reparations..  But the companies - among them Mitsubishi and Nippon Steel - refused, sparking further animosity.. However South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol, elected last year, has sought to mend relations with Japan - another US ally in the region. The US has pressed both nations to improve their relations. . US President Joe Biden called the deal \"ground-breaking\" on Monday. . Seoul's plan proposes that South Korean companies who benefited from a 1965 post-war treaty will pay donations. The fund of $3m (£2.5m) will be distributed among the families of 15 original plaintiffs, only three of whom remain alive. . All three have said they will refuse to accept the money. . Earlier, South Korea's Foreign Minister Park Jin had unveiled the proposals, saying he believed it was in the national interest to break \"the vicious cycle\".. He hoped Japan would \"positively respond... with Japanese companies' voluntary contributions and a comprehensive apology\", Yonhap news agency reported. . \"If we compare it to a glass of water, I think that the glass is more than half full,\" he told journalists.. Japan's foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi also welcomed the plan, saying his government would allow domestic firms to join the public fund. He expressed hope that political and cultural exchanges between the neighbouring countries would expand.. But groups representing plaintiffs in Korea criticised the deal. . \"The Korean government effectively provides immunity to the accused Japanese firms from legal obligations,\" lawyers for the victims said in a statement.. \"I won't take money that seems like the result of begging,\" said one victim, Yang Geum-deok, according to Yonhap. \"You must apologise first and then work through everything else.\". South Korea's main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called the deal \". \".. It remains to be seen if Japanese firms named in the 2018 court ruling will make voluntary contributions.. Mitsubishi and Nippon Steel would not comment on the deal, both referring to previous statements that the issue of wartime compensation had been dealt with in the 1965 treaty, Reuters news agency reported.. That treaty included a reparations package of about $800m in grants and cheap loans. Tokyo maintains it settled all claims relating to the colonial period - but Seoul has long disputed this.. This video can not be played. First known footage of 'comfort women'. The new deal is expected to allow both nations to overcome a huge obstacle in their relationship - and thereby co-operate more closely on security, at a time when mutual threats posed by North Korea and China are increasing. . Since 1945, there have been a series of bilateral disputes, including the issue of compensation for . .. In 2015, a deal was signed aimed at resolving the \"comfort women\" dispute, with a Japanese apology and the formation of a billion-yen ($7.3m) fund for survivors.. However a bitter diplomatic row ensued three years later when Seoul dissolved the fund on the grounds that it did not to do enough to consider victims' concerns.. ",

        "content": "It is a month since the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria - with officials putting the number of deaths in Turkey alone at 45,968. In Syria, more than 6,000 are known to have lost their lives. . Those who survived face an uncertain future. One of their most serious problems is finding somewhere safe to live. At least 1.5 million people are now homeless, and it's unclear how long it will take to find them proper shelter. . The Turkish disaster agency Afad, meanwhile, says almost two million people have now left the quake zone. Some are living with friends or loved ones elsewhere in the country. Flights and trains out of the region are free to those who want to leave. . But in the town of Samandag, near the Mediterranean coast, Songul is clear that she and her family aren't going anywhere. \"This is very important for us. Whatever happens next - even if the house falls down - we will stay here. This is our home, our nest. Everything we have is here. We are not going to leave.\". Precious pieces of furniture have been carefully pulled from the house and set up outside. On top of a polished wooden side table is a holiday souvenir, a picture made of shells from the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. There's a bowl of fruit, with white mould creeping across a large orange. Things that look normal indoors feel strange and out of place when they're sitting in the street.. Right now, the whole family is living in three tents just a few steps away from their damaged home. They sleep and eat there, sharing food cooked on a small camping stove. There's no proper toilet, although they've recovered one from the bathroom and are trying to plumb it in in a makeshift wooden shed. They've even created a small shower area. But it's all very basic, and the lack of space and privacy is obvious. These tents are cramped and overcrowded. . It's been an agonising month for Songul. Seventeen of their relatives were killed in the quake. Her sister Tulay is officially missing. \"We don't know if she is still under the rubble,\" she tells me. \"We don't know whether her body was taken out yet or not. We're waiting. We can't start mourning. We can't even find our lost one.\". Songul's brother-in-law Husemettin and 11-year-old nephew Lozan died when their apartment building in Iskenderun collapsed around them as they slept. We visited what was left of their home, a sprawling pile of twisted debris. Neighbours told us three blocks of flats had fallen.. \"We brought Lozan's body here,\" Songul says quietly. \"We took him from the morgue and buried him close to us in Samandag. Husemettin was buried in the cemetery of the anonymous, we found his name there.\". A picture of the family smiles out of Tulay's still-active Facebook profile, their arms around each other, faces close. Lozan holds a red balloon tightly.. The homelessness crisis created by the quake is so acute because of the real shortage of safe spaces that are left standing. More than 160,000 buildings collapsed or were badly damaged. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates at least 1.5 million people are still inside the quake zone, but with nowhere to live. It's hard to know the real figure, and it could be far higher.. Study cabins are arriving, but too slowly. Tents have appeared everywhere, from sprawling new encampments to individual ones dotted amidst the rubble. There still aren't enough. News that the Turkish Red Crescent had sold some of its stock of taxpayer-funded tents to a charity group - albeit at cost price - led to frustration and anger.. In some cities, people are still living inside public buildings.. In Adana, I met families sleeping on blankets and mattresses spread across a volleyball court. In the port city of Iskenderun they have made their home on two trains parked at the railway station. Seats have become beds, luggage racks are filled with personal possessions and the staff there try hard to keep things clean and tidy. Tears fill the eyes of one young girl as she hugs a pillow instead of a teddy bear. This isn't home.. Songul's children are struggling, too. Toys and games are stuck inside dangerous houses, and there's no school. \"They're bored, there's nothing to keep them busy. They just sit around. They play with their phones, then go to bed early once they run out of charge.\". When night falls, things are even harder. There's no electricity in Samandag now. Songul has draped colourful solar lights across their white tent, just above the bold UNHCR logo. Homeless in their own country, they're not refugees, but they've still lost everything.. \"I put the lamps here to be seen,\" Songul explains. \"We're scared when it gets dark. Having no power is a big problem. The fear is too big, and all night long we feel the aftershocks, so it's hard to sleep.\" Starting to cry, she wipes away the tears with her hand.. \"We are free people, we are used to freedom, independence, everyone living in their own houses,\" adds her husband, Savas. \"But now we are three families, eating in one tent, living and sitting in one single tent.\" . \"This is all new to us, we don't know what the future holds. And there's always the fear. Our houses have collapsed, what will happen next? We just don't know.\". One month on from the devastating earthquake we speak to survivors living in fear on the streets.

        "content": "The China Square shop that had become a hit with consumers because of its cheap goods was the focus of their anger. Its rapid success had rekindled long-held fears about competition from abroad.. The shop, which is in a mall on the outskirts of Nairobi, had already shut its doors, albeit temporarily, by the time of last week's protest as controversy swirled around it.. Barely five weeks into trading, it had become a social media phenomenon. Its low prices compared to what the petty traders were charging and convenient location made it very attractive.. But some small-scale traders, who form a vital part of Kenya's economy, began to notice business dropping off.. \"We want the Chinese out of Kenya. If the Chinese become the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and even hawkers, where will Kenyans go?\" an unnamed trader told journalists at the protest.. Peter Sitati, who imports and sells beauty equipment in Nairobi, was one of those at the demonstration.. He says a plastic pedicure stool that costs around $43 (£35) in his shop, retailed at China Square for about $21, effectively undercutting him by more than 50%.. \"Many Kenyan businesses are going to close their shops and our economy will collapse,\" Mr Sitati argued.. Pressed to explain why he was charging so much more, he said he was covering the taxes and duty he was charged and thought that he might be buying the goods from China at a higher price than China Square.. Despite being asked by the BBC, China Square did not explain how it set its prices, but it might be benefitting from being able to buy in bigger quantities. . It may also have a more direct relationship with the manufacturers. A lot of the smaller Kenyan traders have to go through middle men and may be charged more as a result.. China Square founder Lei Cheng insisted he had done nothing wrong.. \"My business is legal and is centred on healthy competition. We have cooperated with all government directives of opening a business in Kenya and we are here to break the monopoly,\" Mr Lei said.. He added that his business took more than $157,000 in its first two weeks.. \"The people who are fighting us feel threatened because Kenyans now know we exist and we are not exploiting them in pricing.\". Some Kenyan shoppers are on the retailer's side.. \"China Square should be allowed to operate. They're selling quality goods at affordable prices,\" Sharon Wanjiku said.. \"The cost of living is very high at the moment and these prices are exactly what we need.\". The swift popularity of the shop followed by the controversy caught the attention of the government, with one minister saying it should cease operating as a retailer.. \"We welcome Chinese investors to Kenya but as manufacturers not traders,\" Trade Minister Moses Kuria said on Twitter on the Friday before China Square shut down.. It remains unclear why the shop did close its doors to customers. There were suspicions that it had been put under some pressure by the authorities.. A statement from China Square said it was closing to \"re-evaluate and replan our company strategy\" and that it was \"considering a possibility of co-operating with local traders\".. But at the end of last week, Kenya's Anti-Counterfeit Authority said it had investigated a complaint that China Square was selling fake goods but had found no evidence that that was the case.. On Monday, the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce (KCCC) welcomed the re-opening of China Square after discussions were held with the government, however it did not go into details of what the talks were about.. \"The Chamber looks forward to an equal and fair treatment of all businesses across [the] board to ensure a conducive business environment for all,\" the KCCC statement said, but it did not say if any new agreement had been made.. Some fear that the row over the shop has sent out the wrong message about the economy and the interest in investment.. Korir SingOei, from the ministry of foreign affairs, has been seeking to reassure potential investors, saying that Kenya welcomes money from outside and does not discriminate where it comes from.. Wu Peng, the top diplomat for Africa at China's Foreign Ministry, was pleased with the clarification and said a \"non-discriminatory investment environment is vital to the healthy development of bilateral practical co-operation\".. Kenya has in the past struggled to find a middle ground between attracting foreign investment and promoting free trade while protecting local traders from what some see as unfair competition.. \"Stopping foreigners from doing legitimate business in Kenya is retrogressive. We need to see how to build the capacity of Kenyans to be able to produce competitive products,\" says Kenyan economist Gerrishon Ikiara. . The Kenya Investment Promotion Act, which sets conditions for foreign investors, requires an investment to be beneficial to the country through things such as new jobs, the transfer of new skills or technology, or the use of local raw materials or services.. There is no data available to show how many Chinese traders or people are in Kenya, but there has been growing anti-Chinese sentiment in recent years. This has been partly due to allegations that individual Chinese people in Kenya have been racist, as well as fears of Chinese traders taking businesses and jobs from Kenyans.. In 2019, the Kenyan authorities deported seven Chinese nationals who had been operating in two markets in Nairobi, accusing them of not having work permits and saying they could not operate in a sector that had been reserved for locals.. In 2020, four Chinese men were deported after being accused of caning a Kenyan man working at a Chinese restaurant. . President William Ruto has so far steered clear of the matter, but ahead of his election last year he promised to deport Chinese nationals engaging in business that can be done by Kenyans.. \"We have agreements with different countries on what level of business or work is to be done by locals and which one is allowed, where one must have [a] work permit, to foreigners. And that level is not selling in kiosks, retail or roasting maize,\" Mr Ruto said last June.. China Square is clearly not working out of a kiosk, but its re-opening continues to present a challenge to the petty traders, whose complaints have not gone away.. ",

Some Iranians believe the girls' schools are being targeted by hard-line elements to stop them receiving an education. . Others suggest the authorities may be punishing girls for their leading role in the nationwide anti-government protests that erupted in September..

Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei meanwhile warned that they could face the charge of \"corruption on earth\", which is punishable by death..

No casualties have been reported, but the fire on Sunday razed 2,000 shelters after spreading quickly through gas cylinders in kitchens, officials said.. Police are investigating if the fire was an act of sabotage. One man has been detained, local media reported.. The camp in the south-east is believed to be the world's largest refugee camp.. Most of its more than one million residents, Rohingya refugees, had fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.. On Monday, hundreds had returned to the Cox's Bazar area to see what they could salvage from the ruins.. The blaze had started at about 14:45 local time Sunday (08:45 GMT) and quickly tore through the bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters, an official said.. \"Some 2,000 shelters have been burnt, leaving about 12,000 forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals shelterless,\" Mijanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee commissioner, told AFP news agency.. The blaze was brought under control within three hours but at least 35 mosques and 21 learning centres for the refugees were also destroyed, he added.. Photos are now emerging that show the extent of the devastation. . Many of those who lived there can be seen picking through the charred area, where only metal struts and singed corrugated roofing remains..
