        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large MQ-9 Reaper drone . The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.. Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.. \"I don't know whether we'll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done,\" Mr Patrushev said.. He also said that the drone's presence in the Black Sea was \"confirmation\" that the US was directly involved in the war.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.. He said it would be challenging to retrieve the drone, noting the water where it crashed was anywhere between 4,000ft to 5,000ft (1,200m to 1,500m) deep.. US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. In a statement, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. The US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, confirmed he had spoken with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, the day after the drone was downed.. In a statement released after the phonecall, Russia's defence ministry said Mr Shoigu blamed the incident on \"increased reconnaissance activities against the interests of the Russian Federation\". It also called US drone flights off the coast of Crimea \"provocative\".. The US and UK have previously gone to extraordinary lengths to recover their technology after crashes.. They retrieved the wreckage of their stealth fighter jet, the F-35 from the bottom of the South China Sea after it sank.. But on the face of it, the Pentagon seems more relaxed about losing a Reaper drone. It's older technology and numerous have been lost before. . And trying to recover a downed drone in deep waters, next to a war zone, with Russian ships and submarines patrolling, could present even greater risks of escalation. . Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The lost Reaper may have been carrying a surveillance pod able to suck up electronic data such as radar emissions. . The US Department of Defense said.  that the surveillance trips are used to gather information which helps improve security for Europe and supports \"allied partners\". . The US has reportedly shared intelligence with Ukraine previously, . Ukraine's foreign minister told BBC reporter James Landale that incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Dmytro Kuleba said: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place. . Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",

        "content": "HRW said they were living in \"cramped, miserable conditions\" and \"stranded in limbo\" with no hope of being resettled.. The UAE denied that conditions were poor and said it was working with the US to finish the resettlement process.. More than 10,000 other Afghans who were flown to the UAE have reportedly been resettled in the US, Canada and elsewhere, while a further 70,000 were evacuated directly to the US before American troops left Kabul.. The Afghans flown to Abu Dhabi following the Taliban takeover were housed in two converted apartment complexes known as Emirates Humanitarian City and Tasameem Workers City.. , including eight who had previously worked at some point for US government-affiliated entities or programmes in Afghanistan. . They reported constraints on their freedom of movement, lack of access to fair and effective refugee status determination, lack of adequate access to legal counsel, inadequate education for children, and no psychosocial support.. The detainees also described overcrowding, decaying infrastructure and insect infestations, according to the US-based campaign group.. One unnamed Afghan was quoted as saying that Emirates Humanitarian City was \"exactly like a prison\", while another described a \"widespread mental health crisis among residents\".. Under international law and UN Refugee Agency guidance, asylum seekers and migrants should not be detained for administrative purposes unless it is necessary and proportional to achieve a legitimate aim, and only in the absence of viable alternatives.. HRW called on the UAE to release the detainees and provide access to fair and efficient processes for determining their status and protection needs.. \"Governments should not ignore the shocking plight of these Afghans stranded in limbo in the UAE,\" said Joey Shea, the group's UAE researcher. . \"The US government in particular, which co-ordinated the 2021 evacuations and with whom many evacuees worked before the Taliban takeover, should immediately step up and intervene to provide support and protection for these asylum seekers.\". An Emirati official told AFP news agency that the UAE was providing \"high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counselling, education and food services\" for the Afghans at Emirates Humanitarian City.. They also said the UAE was continuing to work with US authorities to \"resettle the remaining evacuees in a timely manner\".. \"We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete,\" they added.. The US state department said there was an \"enduring\" US commitment to resettle all eligible Afghans, including those at Emirates Humanitarian City.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Truck washed away as floods hit Turkey earthquake zone. Among the victims were quake survivors who had been living in container homes since the quakes.. Cars tumbled on a torrent of floodwater through the streets of Sanliurfa, where 12 people died.. A container housing two families in Adiyaman was caught up in the floods.. A woman living in the container was among two people killed in the city. Several others were reported missing. Tents in the city were evacuated.. The latest disaster came only five weeks after the twin earthquakes on 6 February in which 48,000 people were killed and many more left homeless.. Search and rescue organisation Afad said that in one 24-hour period, 136mm (5.4in) of rain had fallen in one area of Adiyaman province and 111mm (4.4in) in Sanliurfa, which saw a third of its annual rainfall in the past two days.. The governor of Sanliurfa, Salih Ayhan, said his province had never seen flooding like it and officials appealed to residents to evacuate the ground floor and basements of homes. . The bodies of five people were found in a basement apartment and Turkish media said they were Syrians.. Bodies were also recovered from an underpass at the major Abide road junction.. Several people were dragged off in their vehicles by the current of the floodwaters and people who tried to help those stranded were themselves swept away.. Dramatic footage emerged of a man being pulled out of the torrent in Sanliurfa by a local dangling a rope from a ground-floor window. A similar rescue took place at the Abide junction.. Two of the missing were firefighters, said the governor, who appealed to residents to keep well away from the moving water. A hospital was flooded and 200 patients moved elsewhere.. The rain is due to die down towards the end of the week.. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is grappling with the aftermath of last month's earthquake, is facing elections on 14 May. He has sent the interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, to the flood region.. Leading opposition figures are also due to visit Sanliurfa, and have vowed to help meet the urgent needs of residents.. ",
