        "content": "Labour's Peter Obi has close to 18%, having caused an upset by defeating Mr Tinubu in the biggest city, Lagos. . On Monday, Mr Abubakar's and Mr Obi's parties walked out of the venue where results are being announced.. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party have claimed there is a lack of transparency with the new electronic voter system.. This was the first national election where an electronic device had been used to accredit voters.. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has denied the opposition parties' complaints.. Its chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue.. European Union observers said the electoral body's poor planning and communication undermined trust in the process.. The PDP representative at the election centre in the capital, Abuja, described the process as fraudulent, and accused the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec. The Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. The APC said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course.. A candidate needs to have the most votes nationwide and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner.. If those thresholds are not reached then there will a second round run-off between the top two candidates.. The APC and PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999.. Mr Obi - from the previously little known Labour Party - ran for the first time, promising to challenge the two-party system. . He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. From the results announced so far Mr Tinubu has won the most votes in six states, Mr Abubakar five and Mr Obi three.. ",

Fox News denies defamation - saying the hosts' words were taken out of context. . \"Some of our commentators were endorsing it,\" Mr Murdoch said in a sworn deposition filed on Monday. . Asked about certain on-air claims that echoed Mr Trump's, he said: \"I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it, in hindsight.\". Regarding the Republican former president's allegations of widespread voter fraud, Mr Murdoch said he was doubtful.. Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6bn (£1.3bn), arguing the conservative outlet broadcast false and malicious rumours about voter fraud that harmed its business.. Fox News has argued that the comments are protected under the constitutional right to free speech, and that it was only reporting on Mr Trump's allegations, not supporting them. . In a statement provided to BBC News on Monday, Fox said Dominion's lawsuit \"mischaracterizes the facts by cherry-picking soundbites, omitting key context, and mischaracterizing the record\".. In order to prove defamation, lawyers for Dominion would have to successfully argue that Fox presented false information, and did so knowing that it was untrue. . A jury trial is expected to begin in Delaware in April. . ",

A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry accused the US of abusing state power to suppress foreign firms.. \"We firmly oppose those wrong actions,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday. \"The US government should respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, stop suppressing the companies and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the US.\". \"How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower like the US be to fear young people's favourite app like that,\" she added. . Western officials have become increasingly concerned about the popular video sharing app - which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance - in recent months. . TikTok has faced allegations that it harvests users' data and hands it to the Chinese government, with some intelligence agencies worried that sensitive information could be exposed when the app is downloaded to government devices.. TikTok says it would never comply with an order to share user data and insists it operates no differently from other social media companies.. On Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young told agencies they had to scrub the app from all state-issued phones to protect confidential data. . The agency said the guidance marked a \"critical step forward in addressing the risks presented by the app to sensitive government data\". . Some federal offices - including the White House and the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State - have already banned TikTok from their devices. . The US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said the move emphasised President Joe Biden administration's \"ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people's security and privacy\". . Tuesday's announcement follows the passage of legislation by the US House of Representatives in December which banned the use of TikTok on state-issued phones and gave the White House 60 days to issue agency directives. . And congressional Republicans are expected to pass further legislation in the coming weeks which would give President Biden the power to ban the app nationally. .  starting from Tuesday. The decision followed a review conducted by the country's chief information officer, who ruled the app presented \"an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\".. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.. \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.. Last week, the European Commission and the European Council ordered employees to remove the TikTok app from their phones and corporate devices. . \"The measure aims to protect the commission against cyber-security threats and actions which may be exploited for cyber-attacks against the corporate environment of the commission,\" a commission employee said. .

        "content": "The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education.. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis.. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World.. \"There's a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\". For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department.. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 square miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year.. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state.. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes.. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (£41,467) to Mr DeSantis' re-election campaign.. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed.. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\".. Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.. Friction between Disney, one of the world's biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April.. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under.. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content.. Mr DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power.. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that's happened over the past couple of years, I've always been very proud of our parks,\" he said.. \"It's almost like a right of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you've got to have people who can tell you the truth.\".
