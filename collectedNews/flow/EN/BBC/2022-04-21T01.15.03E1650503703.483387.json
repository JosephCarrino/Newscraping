        "content": "MPs were set to vote on Thursday on a Labour plan for a Commons committee to investigate his past comments about Whitehall gatherings.. But ministers now say that vote should wait until probes by the Met Police and civil servant Sue Gray have finished.. Some rebel Tory MPs were threatening to vote with Labour, or not at all. . A Labour source said Tory whips \"knew that they couldn't vote this down\" - and MPs backing the government would be \"voting for a cover-up\".. Along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the PM was fined for breaking Covid laws at a June 2020 birthday party for him in No 10.. He had previously told MPs that no Covid laws were broken in Downing Street - leading opposition parties to accuse him of having misled Parliament.. Mr Johnson has denied knowingly misleading MPs - a charge that is a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook.. Labour's plan - which was supported by other opposition parties - aimed to have the Commons privileges committee launch an inquiry into whether he had.. But the government has now tabled its own amendment to Labour's proposal, to say a vote on whether they should investigate should wait until the police have concluded their investigations and Ms Gray has published her report.. Conservative MPs will be ordered to vote for it - meaning it is highly likely to pass given the government's Commons majority. However Mr Johnson will miss the vote himself as he is making an official trip to India. . Speaking to reporters on the plane, the PM said it would be more appropriate for MPs to wait until the police and Ms Gray have finished their inquiries. . \"I think the best thing that we can all do is focus on the things that really change and improve the lives of voters and stop talking about politicians,\" he added.. No 10 insiders say they were confident they could have killed off an inquiry on Thursday - and not enough Tory MPs were prepared to rebel against the government.. But there was clearly anxiety among Tory MPs about being forced to publicly block an investigation.. Which one of them wanted to have their face displayed on social media ads and leaflets in May's local elections, accused of taking part in a \"stitch-up\"? . The bet ministers are making is that once the Met investigation and Sue Gray's report are finished and published, there may not be appetite for yet another investigation into lockdown parties. . But should more fines emerge, or Sue Gray's report reveal particularly damning evidence, this could become more risky. . All they've done for now is delay the decision on whether the prime minister should face investigation, not killed it off completely. . It's a gamble, it seems, they are willing to make. . Mr Johnson is known to have attended at least two further events of the 12 being investigated by police, meaning he could be fined again.. Apologising for his fine on Tuesday, he said he respected the police's decision but argued that he did not think he was breaking the law at the time.. Sir Keir Starmer called his apology a \"joke\" and accused him of offering \"insulting\" and \"absurd\" excuses for his Covid fine.. Under Labour's plan, the privileges committee - made up of seven MPs - would have begun a probe after the Met inquiry has concluded.. The committee, which has a Tory majority, would determine whether the PM had committed a \"contempt\" of Parliament by misleading MPs. . The committee can ask for witnesses to give evidence and produce documents as part of its inquiries.. It can also recommend sanctions including suspension of an MP - although this requires the approval of the whole House of Commons. . When asked whether there was a party in Downing Street on 18 December 2020, Boris Johnson told the Commons on .  that \"all guidance was followed completely in No 10\". . After the .  showing No 10 staff joking about the 18 December event, he told MPs on .  he had been \"repeatedly assured\" that \"there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken\".. Later that day, he told the Commons he was \"sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\". . On . , he apologised for attending a Downing Street garden party on 20 May 2020 but said he had \"believed implicitly\" it was a work event..

        "content": "A competition watchdog will get new powers to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for bad business practices.. But an industry group said the new rules shouldn't put \"any further unnecessary burdens on businesses\".. The average UK household spends about £900 each year after being influenced by online reviews and spends £60 on \"unwanted subscriptions\", the government said.. Under the proposed rules, there will be a new laws against offering to write and commissioning fake reviews.. Websites hosting consumer reviews will have to take reasonable steps to check they are genuine.. Reviews website Trustpilot said it \"welcomes legislation introduced with the aim of protecting consumers from fake reviews\".. It said it is \"continually working to ensure we are taking appropriate action against attempts to manipulate reviews on our site\".. Tripadvisor, a travel reviews website, said its operations \"are geared towards identifying, blocking and removing fake reviews\".. \"The most direct way to protect consumers from biased and inaccurate information is to focus public policies and enforcement on the bad actors,\" said Becky Foley, senior safety director at Tripadvisor.. The government also wants to bring in new rules against \"subscription traps\", in which businesses make it difficult to leave a contract. . Businesses will have to give clearer information to consumers before they sign up to a subscription contract.. They will need to send a reminder that a free trial or low-cost introductory offer is coming to an end, and ensure customers can leave a contract in a \"straightforward, cost-effective and timely way\", the government said.. Small business minister Paul Scully said the consumers deserved better and the majority of business doing the \"right thing\" deserved \"protection from rogue traders undermining them\".. \"No longer will you visit a five star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there's no end in sight,\" he said.. If the government proposals are made into law, prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs will also have to safeguard fully customers' money through insurance or trust accounts.. Shoppers' savings clubs - where consumers pay for goods and services in instalments throughout the year - are not currently covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.. Under the proposals, even if the company goes bust, shoppers' money will still be protected.. The rules aim to prevent issues such as the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose money when the company went bust in 2006.. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties worth up to 10% of global annual turnover for businesses that transgress the new rules, or up to £300,000 in the case of an individual.. The government said CMA's new powers will mean cases will no longer need to go through the courts.. Instead, the CMA will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties.. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the impact of fake reviews was \"enormous\".. She said the process to \"hold businesses to account\" was \"far too complicated and lengthy\".. \"Britain's consumer and competition laws are in desperate need of an upgrade,\" Ms Concha added.. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the extra powers the CMA stands to gain would \"help stamp out the practice of fake reviews, which do irreparable damage to businesses\".. However, she said the \"devil will be in the detail\" of the policy.. UK Hospitality wants to see that the \"consumers are safeguarded without placing any further unnecessary burdens on businesses\".. She said the new CMA powers should not \"unfairly punish businesses\" especially small businesses, adding that there needed to be \"a clear right of appeal\".. \"Fairness for both businesses and consumers, particularly when it comes to offering refunds, will be crucial and any new measures must also be made in the context of a sector facing an onslaught of challenges after a difficult two years,\" she added.. The government also said the CMA's powers will allow it to \"have stronger tools to tackle companies colluding to bump-up prices\" and to also stop \"killer acquisitions\" in which big businesses snap up rivals before they can launch new products or services.. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the new rules were an \"important milestone towards strengthening the CMA's ability to hold companies to account, promote fair and open markets, and protect UK consumers\"..

Speaking to . , Ms Sturgeon said she hoped addressing the issue would help tackle the stigma around the subject. . She said she had been considering how she would cope given her public role. . Ms Sturgeon said: \"I feel quite nervous [talking] about it as well. It's not the kind of thing I feel instinctively comfortable talking about - I think because it is so intensely personal, and there's still a lot of stigma around it.\". On her own experience, the 51-year-old said: \"Obviously I'm in the foothills of it. I've been quite anxious about - given the public nature of my job - how I am going to cope with the impact of that, what's it going to be like.\" . She said she knew it was important to use her platform to talk about her experience, and hoped women in a similar position would benefit from hearing about her experience. . Ms Sturgeon said she wished she could go and read about other politicians' experience of the menopause. . \"If I could go and read Angela Merkel or Hilary Clinton saying 'this is what it was like for me and how I coped with it', I think that would help me right now,\" . She hoped sharing her experience would help the next generation of female leaders. . Earlier this year, the first minister spoke to a podcast about menopause.. She told .  there was still a \"massive amount of guesswork\" about menopause and that many women still suffered in silence. . She said she had already had a conversation with her doctor about hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a treatment to relieve symptoms which works by replacing hormones that decrease as women approach menopause.. Ms Sturgeon added that she had not started treatment yet, but was of the generation that grew up thinking that HRT was \"some terrible, terrible thing\" and that it was a \"badge of honour to push yourself through without it\". . Some women .  hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety and mood changes.. She said: \"I'm at the stage where definitely I'm feeling a bit hotter overnight, not being able to sleep and I've got windows open in the depths of winter,\" she said. . The first minister had not experienced \"extreme\" symptoms in public or in meetings, but she said she had thought about what would happen if she got a hot flush for example in parliament when she was on her feet in the middle of First Minister's Questions. . Ms Sturgeon added that she was concerned speaking up could be used against her in some way.. In the wide-ranging interview with Loose Women, the first minister was also asked about whether she and her husband were still considering fostering. . She said the couple had talked about it but had \"only scratched the surface\", adding: \"It would be a really serious decision to take.\". \"It's for the future, but it's something that we have thought about and talked about but only in an initial stage.\" . \"You shouldn't do it to fill a gap in your own life - it should be about the young person. . \"So I wouldn't want to do it just because I don't have children of my own, it would only be if I genuinely thought I could offer something to a young person.\" . Ms Sturgeon added: \"Circumstances have meant that I have never had children... and obviously I had a miscarriage and spoke about that because there's still a lot of stigma around that as well, so I think it is important to open up these conversations.\". The first minister . , while she was deputy first minister. . Speaking previously about her loss, she said she hoped it would challenge assumptions made about why she - and other women - did not have children. .

While the confidential information on the decision has yet to be made public, Lord Bew hinted it could emerge \"in the coming days\".. Newspaper owner Lord Lebedev is the Russian-born son of a KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, and fresh questions arose about the security risk he could pose to the UK after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. . He denied posing a \"security risk\" to the country and he backed the publication of the security advice, tweeting: \"I have nothing to hide.\". Labour claimed the House of Lords Appointment Committee (HOLAC) - which Lord Bew chairs - advised the PM against giving the businessman the honour.. The party says it changed its mind after Boris Johnson overruled security service concerns.. The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, made up of MPs, is looking into the role of HOLAC after the controversy surrounding Lord Lebedev's peerage. . Mr Johnson is known to have been aware of security service concerns, with former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings saying he was \"in the room\" when the prime minister was told intelligence officials had \"serious reservations\" about the move.. Another source has confirmed to the BBC that concerns were raised by security services.. Giving evidence to MPs, Lord Bew said there was \"uncertainty\" around Lord Lebedev's case, and a \"special set of circumstances\" when it came to the businessman - pointing to his father's former job. . \"It would be ridiculous not to say that this isn't a case of particular complexity with many wrinkles to it,\" he said. . \"How much is someone responsible for his father etc?\". But he claimed Lord Lebedev went through the usual vetting process and no-one interfered with the committee's work. . \"At no other point was there pressure placed on us on this case,\" he said.. Lord Bew also denied trying to block the peerage, saying rather than warning against appointing him, the committee merely warned about a public backlash.. The chair confirmed a letter to No 10, saying: \"You are going to have to take the flak for it if you go ahead.\". Lord Bew added: \"We are uncomfortable with the use of the word 'warning' with respect to any of the advice we have ever received from any of the agencies [on peerage applications]. . \"What we get are facts which we are asked to interpret and reflect upon.\". He did admit HOLAC \"needed clarification\" on what was sent to them by security services on Lord Lebedev, and the response took \"weeks\". . But he said: \"You know we did not say no to the prime minister [on Lebedev] - you know the bottom line. as the Americans would say.\". Bill Bailey on Eurovision and the inspiration for his new show.

Sir Keir Starmer demanded an apology at Prime Minister's Questions.. The PM said the Rwanda policy was an attempt to save lives in the Channel.. In his Easter Sunday sermon, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the policy of sending some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda cannot \"stand the judgment of God\".. Mr Johnson accused \"senior members of the clergy\" and the BBC of misconstruing the policy in a speech to Tory MPs on Tuesday evening.. The PM was attempting to rally support from his MPs after .  by the police for breaking Covid laws.. He suggested, in an aside, that the clergy had been less vociferous in condemning Vladimir Putin, according to No 10 sources.. This video can not be played. Mr Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement issued by Lambeth Palace that they would continue to oppose the policy on \"moral and ethical grounds\".. The two senior clergymen had denounced the invasion of Ukraine as \"an act of great evil\" and had called for Russian troops to withdraw, the statement added.. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of not being sincere in his apology for breaking Covid rules at his birthday party in June 2020.. As soon as he was off camera, the PM had gone back to \"blaming everyone else\" he said, adding: \"Would the prime minister like to take this opportunity to apologise for slandering the Archbishop and the Church of England?\". Mr Johnson said he was surprised to be attacked over a policy that had been devised to \"end the deaths at sea in the Channel as a result of cruel criminal gangs\" and had, he claimed, been first devised in 2004 by [then Labour home secretary] David Blunkett.. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson should resign because he \"can't be trusted with the truth\".. Mr Johnson and the Labour leader also clashed over .  of the war in Ukraine in his speech to MPs.. Sir Keir accused the PM of opting to \"slander decent people\" in private but lacking the \"backbone to repeat it in public\".. He said: \"The prime minister also accused the BBC of not being critical enough of Putin.. \"Would the prime minister have the guts to say that to the face of [BBC reporters] Clive Myrie, Lyse Doucet and Steve Rosenberg, who have all risked their lives day in, day out on the frontline in Russia and Ukraine uncovering Putin's barbarism?\". Mr Johnson replied: \"I said nothing of the kind and I have the highest admiration as a former journalist for what journalists do. I think they do an outstanding job. I think he should withdraw what he just said - it has absolutely no basis or foundation in truth.\". After PMQs, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said Sir Keir had no evidence for his claim that the PM had accused the BBC of not being critical enough of President Putin, and called on the Labour leader to apologise for the comments.. In a letter to Sir Keir, Mr Dowden said the prime minister had a \"long track record of supporting the free press and the BBC, particularly with regards to their coverage of the conflict in Ukraine\". . \"I call on you to retract your comments and apologise to the prime minister and the House,\" he added.. MPs will vote on Thursday whether to ask the Privileges Committee to consider whether Mr Johnson misled them on at least four occasions over the Partygate row, and is therefore in contempt of Parliament.. Tory MPs are expected to be ordered to oppose the Labour-led cross-party motion on Thursday, although the prime minister will not vote on it as he will be on an official visit to India.. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Conservative MPs should think carefully before voting to block an investigation into Boris Johnson's lies. . \"The public won't stomach another Conservative stitch-up that drags our democracy through the mud just to protect one of their own.\".
