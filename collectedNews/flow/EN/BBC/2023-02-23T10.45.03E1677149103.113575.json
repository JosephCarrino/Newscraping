        "content": "Just east of Los Angeles there's been a blizzard warning, unheard of in those parts.. \"I have to be totally honest with you guys,\" one meteorologist told the camera, \"I've actually never seen a blizzard warning.\". That was Meteorologist Evelyn Taft of station KCAL. She's been covering California weather for nearly 14 years. She stresses this is a bizarre weather event for Southern California, known locally as SoCal. It's \"unbelievable\", she says.. As much as 5ft (1.5m) of snow could fall in the mountains with wind gusts up to 75mph (121km/h). The lower foothills, like Santa Clarita, will see a rare dusting of snow.. \"Never thought that my move to LA would involve storm coverageâ€¦ with snow,\" tweeted KCAL anchor Sheba Turk. She shared a video of herself in nearby Lebec, California, as big flakes of snow landed on her jacket. \"Look at this,\" she says. \"You see the flurries?\". \"I had to stop and get gloves. I didn't even bring gloves to LA with me.\" . Meteorologist Paul Deanno warned his Twitter followers they might start to see snow starting late Wednesday night. That's \"not a typo\", he said.. \"First blizzard warning of my career,\" tweeted Autumn Robinson of Spectrum News 1.. \"...In So Cal,\" she continued. \"Cool I guess.\" . Snow may be rare in Southern California, but the area is no stranger to extreme weather. Wildfires regularly spread through the area, and a years-long drought was just interrupted in January by heavy rains and flooding. . Meteorologists in SoCal and elsewhere say such extreme weather events are likely to grow more severe as the climate changes.. ",

        "content": "Official figures published last month showed Japan's rate of inflation was at its highest level in over 40 years.. That has put pressure on businesses and authorities to help people as their spending power shrinks.. Each year Japanese firms typically hold pay talks with unions for weeks before announcing their decisions around the middle of March.. The car makers have not said why this year's announcements were made earlier than usual.. On Wednesday, Toyota said it will meet union demands for pay and bonuses, with wages increasing by the most in 20 years.. Toyota's incoming president Koji Sato said that he hoped the move would have a positive impact across the Japan's motor industry and \"lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company.\". The company declined to provide further details when approached by the BBC.. Meanwhile, rival car maker Honda told the BBC that it had \"fully answered\" union requests for wage increases and bonuses.. The company said it will raise salaries by 5%, marking the biggest increase since 1990 and above Japan's rate of inflation.. A Honda spokesperson said the extra money will largely be distributed to younger employees as starting salaries are boosted.. \"Despite the severe business environment, management has a strong desire to create an environment in which all employees can... push forward with their work with a sense of urgency,\" the spokesperson added.. Earlier this year, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida called on firms to raise wages to help people struggling with rising prices.. In January, the owner of fashion chain Uniqlo, Fast Retailing, said . . . The company said the new pay policy would apply to full-time employees at its headquarters and company stores in Japan from the beginning of March.. For decades both prices and wage growth in Japan had been stagnant.. In recent months inflation around the world jumped as countries eased pandemic restrictions and the war in Ukraine pushed up energy prices.. In December, . , double the central bank's target level and the highest rate in 41 years.. This video can not be played. Why are things so expensive?
