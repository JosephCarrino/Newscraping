        "content": "Watch: Johnson says Putin threatened him in phone call before Ukraine invasion. The then-prime minister said Mr Putin told him it \"would only take a minute\".. Mr Johnson said the comment was made after he warned the war would be an \"utter catastrophe\" during a \"very long\" call in February 2022.. Details of the exchange are revealed in a BBC documentary, examining Mr Putin's interactions with world leaders.. Mr Johnson warned Mr Putin that invading Ukraine would lead to Western sanctions and more Nato troops on Russia's borders. . He also tried to deter Russian military action by telling Mr Putin that Ukraine would not join Nato \"for the foreseeable future\". . But Mr Johnson said: \"He threatened me at one point, and he said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute' or something like that. Jolly. . \"But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.\". President Putin had been \"very familiar\" during the \"most extraordinary call\", Mr Johnson said.  . From the 2014 seizure of Crimea to the invasion of Ukraine, this is the inside story of a decade of clashes - as told by the Western leaders who traded blows with Putin's Russia.. It is impossible to know if Mr Putin's threat was genuine.  . However, given previous Russian attacks on the UK - most recently in Salisbury in 2018 - any threat from the Russian leader, however lightly delivered, is probably one Mr Johnson would have had no choice but to take seriously. . Nine days later, on 11 February, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Moscow to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu.. The BBC documentary Putin Vs the West reveals Mr Wallace left with assurances that Russia would not invade Ukraine, but he said both sides knew it was a lie. . He described it as a \"demonstration of bullying or strength, which is: I'm going to lie to you, you know I'm lying and I know you know I'm lying and I'm still going to lie to you.. \"I think it was about saying 'I'm powerful',\" Mr Wallace said. . He said the \"fairly chilling, but direct lie\" had confirmed his belief that Russia would invade. . As he left the meeting, he said Gen Valery Gerasimov - Russia's chief of general staff - told him \"never again will we be humiliated\". . Less than a fortnight later, as tanks rolled over the border on 24 February, Mr Johnson received a phone call in the middle of the night from President Zelensky.. \"Zelensky's very, very calm,\" Mr Johnson recalled. \"But, he tells me, you know, they're attacking everywhere.\". Mr Johnson says he offered to help move the president to safety. . \"He doesn't take me up on that offer. He heroically stayed where he was.\". ",

        "content": "About 350 people needed emergency accommodation, New Zealand's prime minister Chris Hipkins said.. He added there had been significant damage across Auckland and the north island.. The newly appointed PM also highlighted climate change's role in the extreme weather event.. \"It's a 1-in-100-year weather event, and we seem to be getting a lot of them at the moment. I think people can see that there's a message in that...Climate change is real, it's with us,\" Mr Hipkins said on Monday.. He told national broadcaster TVNZ: \"We are going to have to deal with more of these extreme weather events in the future. . \"We need to be prepared for that. And we need to do everything we can to combat the challenge of climate change,\" he added.. Mr Hipkins also acknowledged criticism from locals that communications over the floods had been \"too few and far between\". . With the unprecedented rainfall Auckland has seen since Friday, even \"ordinary\" torrential rain in the days ahead could cause more flooding and damage than it would usually, the city's mayor said in a tweet on Monday.. \"In parts of the city, the weather looks a bit better - but, don't be fooled, our region is not out of the woods yet,\" Wayne Brown said.. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change increase the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, the country's climate science body, said Friday was the wettest day on record for a number of locations in Auckland. . Footage and images online showed people trapped in waist-deep floodwater, rescuers carrying out evacuations on kayaks and grocery items floating down the aisles of several flooded supermarkets. . Auckland Airport, which was temporarily closed due to damage from heavy flooding, has since reopened.. New Zealand media have identified two individuals who died in the floods. Daniel Newth, a 25-year-old arborist, died while kayaking near his North Shore home, and Daniel Mark Miller, 34, was found dead in a culvert in the Auckland suburb Wairu Valley.. ",

        "content": "\"If you absolutely want to join Nato, you will return these terrorists to us,\" said Mr Erdogan.. His comments come days after Turkey suspended talks to accept the two Nordic nations as members.. The move was prompted by a series of controversial protests in Stockholm, including one during which a copy of the Koran was burned.. Swedish officials have condemned the protests, but defended the country's free speech laws.. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland applied to join Nato last year, ending decades of military non-alignment.. Their application must be unanimously approved by all current Nato members, but Turkey and Hungary have failed to ratify their bids.. In his speech, Mr Erdogan suggested Turkey might now \"give a different response concerning Finland,\" adding that \"Sweden will be shocked\".. \"We gave Sweden a list of 120 persons and told them to extradite those terrorists in their country,\" said Mr Erdogan. \"If you don't extradite them, then sorry about that.\". Sweden has a larger Kurdish diaspora than Finland, and its talks with Ankara over Nato membership have been heated.. Turkey has called on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU.. In response, Sweden approved a constitutional amendment which allows it to create tougher anti-terror laws demanded by Turkey.. Both Sweden and Finland have also lifted bans on the sale of military equipment to Turkey, introduced after Ankara's military intervention in Syria in 2019.. But Turkey has heavily criticised Sweden over recent protests in Stockholm, . Earlier this month, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May.. Helsinki's Foreign Minister, Pekka Haavisto, has since .  and that negotiations should be paused.. The diplomat also stressed his country should join at the same time as Sweden - appearing to backtrack on his earlier suggestion that Finland could be forced to join without its Nordic neighbour.. ",

It was lost between the town of Newman and the city of Perth, a distance of roughly 1,400km (870 miles).. \"As well as fully supporting the relevant authorities, we have launched our own investigation to understand how the capsule was lost in transit,\" Rio Tinto's Iron Ore chief executive Simon Trott said in a statement.. \"As part of this investigation we are working closely with the contractor to better understand what went wrong in this instance,\" he added.. Rio Tinto said the device involved was a density gauge which is commonly used in the mining industry. It was being used at its Gudai-Darri mine site in Western Australia to measure the density of iron ore feed.. The silver capsule is just 6mm (0.24 inches) in diameter and 8mm long.. The company said the capsule left the mine on 12 January. It was reported missing on 25 January, although it remains unclear how long the item has been missing.. \"Rio Tinto engaged a third-party contractor, with appropriate expertise and certification, to safely package the device in preparation for transport off-site ahead of receipt at their facility in Perth. Prior to the device leaving the site, a Geiger counter was used to confirm the presence of the capsule inside the package.\". A Geiger counter is an electronic device used for detecting and measuring radiation.. State officials have issued a radiation alert across a vast swathe of Western Australia.. Authorities are now searching for the capsule on the route from Newman - a small town in the remote Kimberley region - to a storage facility in the northeast suburbs of Perth.. However, exposure to trace quantities of the metal is like \"receiving 10 X-rays in an hour, just to put it in context, and... the amount of natural radiation we would receive in a year, just by walking around,\" said Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew Robertson.. The state's desert is remote and one of the least populated places in the country. Only one in five of Western Australia's population lives outside of Perth, the state's capital. . However, officials say they are concerned that someone could pick up the capsule, not knowing what it is.. \"If you have contact or have it close to you, you could either end up with with skin damage, including skin burns... and if you have it long enough near you, you could cause what is called acute radiation sickness, and that will take a period of time,\" Mr Robertson added.. This incident comes as the company is trying to repair its reputation in Australia after it was hit by a . Rio Tinto blasted the 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge to expand an iron ore mine.. The incident sparked a major outcry that led to several of the company's top bosses standing down.. In September 2020, then-chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and other senior executives, including the heads of its iron ore and corporate relations divisions, said they would leave the company..

But Ukraine .  if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete.. Attempts by the IOC \"to bring Russian athletes back into the Olympic Games are attempts to tell the whole world that terror is somehow acceptable\", Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. Russia must not be allowed to use the Games \"or any other sport event as propaganda for its aggression or its state chauvinism\", he added.. The IOC said this week that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as \"neutral athletes\", stating that \"no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport\".. But Mr Zelensky says there can be no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes are dying on the battlefield.. He also drew comparison with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin when the Nazis were in power.. \"There was a major Olympic mistake,\" he said. \"The Olympic movement and terrorist states definitely should not cross paths.\". The UK government has also condemned the plan to allow athletes to compete neutrally as a \"world away from the reality of war\".. Mr Zelensky's comments came as Russian forces continued to bombard the Ukrainian region of Kherson into the night, after a day of attacks which left at least three people dead.  . Six others were wounded, two of them when a hospital was hit, local officials say. . The Kherson regional administration said the region was shelled almost 40 times on Saturday and was pounded continually on Sunday. . Kherson was the only regional capital to have fallen to Russian forces since the February 2022 invasion, but they were forced into a humiliating retreat in November. . President Zelensky said Russia had also stepped up its attacks in the eastern Donetsk region. He said his forces needed new weapons to confront a \"very tough\" situation of constant attacks.. \"Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We have to speed up events, speed up supplies and open up new weapons options for Ukraine,\" he said. . ",
