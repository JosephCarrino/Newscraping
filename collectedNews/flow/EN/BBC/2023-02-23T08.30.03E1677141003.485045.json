        "content": "WATCH: UN Chief condemns Ukraine war in special meeting. The meeting was debating a motion backed by Ukraine and its allies demanding Russia pull out immediately and unconditionally.. Ukraine hopes that by supporting the motion countries will show solidarity.. The Kremlin has accused the West of wanting to defeat Russia at any cost. . Vasily Nebenzya, the Kremlin's ambassador to the UN, said the US and its allies were prepared to plunge the entire world into war.. Russian President Vladimir .  in the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two. . The devastating war that ensued has left at least 7,199 civilians dead and thousands of others injured, according to . , but that number is likely to be much higher.. The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where mass executions are alleged to have taken place, estimated in April that 21,000 people had died there alone.  . Russia and Ukraine have each seen at least 100,000 of their soldiers killed or injured, . .   . More than 13 million people were made refugees abroad or displaced inside Ukraine.. Mr Putin's claim that his operation was needed to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine, a country with historic ties to Russia, was dismissed by Ukraine and its allies as a ruse for an unprovoked attack.. \"That invasion is an affront to our collective conscience,\" Mr Guterres told the General Assembly. \"It is a violation of the United Nations Charter and international law.\" . The possible consequences of a \"spiralling conflict\" were, he said, a \"clear and present danger\".. Mr Guterres said the war was \"fanning regional instability and fuelling global tensions and divisions, while diverting attention and resources from other crises and pressing global issues\".. There had, he said, been \"implicit threats to use nuclear weapons\".. \"It is high time to step back from the brink,\" he said.. \"Complacency will only deepen the crisis, while further eroding our shared principles proclaimed in the Charter. War is not the solution. War is the problem. People in Ukraine are suffering enormously. Ukrainians, Russians and people far beyond need peace.\". Sixty countries have sponsored the resolution, which stresses \"the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\". The UN is likely to approve the resolution, which is not legally binding but carries political weight. However, it is unlikely that the vote will have much influence on Russia's actions in Ukraine. . Voting will take place later on Thursday, the eve of the invasion's first anniversary. . Over the past year, the General Assembly has voted on similar resolutions opposing Russia's invasion. In October 143 member states voted to condemn Moscow's illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine. Russia, Belarus, Syria, and North Korea opposed the motion, while India and China were among the 35 states that abstained.. This video can not be played. Watch: Battle for the city of Bakhmut intensifies. Mr Guterres was speaking after Russia's President Vladimir .  for the war. . In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Putin also announced Russia's decision to suspend a key nuclear arms treaty after US President Joe Biden, fresh from a surprise visit to Kyiv, praised Western democracy for standing up to Russian aggression.. Mr Biden has called the decision to suspend the treaty, designed by the US and Russia in 2010 to prevent nuclear war, a . .. On Wednesday, Mr Putin met China's top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, in Moscow and said co-operation with Beijing was \"very important to stabilise the international situation\". The visit marked an end to .  regarding the war in Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "It comes after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and Canadian airspace before it was shot down by the US military. . China has also been recently accused of interfering with Canadian elections. . Monitoring buoys were discovered and retrieved last fall as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the country's security by surveilling air, land and sea domains.. A spokesperson for Canada's Department of National Defence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, said in a statement that the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches\". . Mr Le Bouthillier added that China does this using \"dual-purpose technologies\", meaning devices that conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes. . He said the military has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory since 2022, but did not elaborate on their nature.. China has long displayed interest in the Arctic. It has sent high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and participates in most major Arctic institutions. . It has also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north, often for research expeditions.. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate change, and gain access to emerging resources.. But experts say that China's research interests in the region have also doubled as attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.. Their efforts are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US, Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped potential in the region.. \"This is a part of the world that has not been mapped and understood to the same degree of detail as other latitudes,\" said Roberto Mazzolin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a former high-ranking official in the Canadian Armed Forces. . Mr Mazzolin said Canada has historically looked at the Arctic as a safe area with little potential for threat. But interest in the region by Russia, and more recently China, has changed that.. \"[Canada is forced to] look at how we would posture our own security, our military defence, or our economic development activities to secure Canadian and American interests,\" he said. . On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that she views China as an increasingly disruptive power. . Ms Joly added that Canada is working closely with the US to protect North American airspace, as well as Canada's Arctic sovereignty.. The Canadian military's discovery of the Chinese buoys comes at the heels of revelations by Canadian intelligence that China had tried to interfere in Canada's last federal election in 2021. . In documents first reported on by the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service outlined China's efforts to re-elect Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority of government, and to ensure the defeat of Conservative politicians who are seen as unfriendly to China.. It did so through cash donations to preferred candidates, the spread of disinformation and using consulates and paid students to help certain Liberal candidates, according to reporting by the Globe. . Canadian parliamentarians are in the midst of probing allegations that China interfered in Canada's 2019 federal election. On Tuesday, they expanded their scope to include the 2021 election as well. . On Wednesday, Prime Minister Trudeau called the suspected Chinese election interference \"an extraordinarily serious issue\", and said he supported a further probe into these reports. . He added the meddling efforts so far appear to have been unsuccessful, but still raise concern that foreign countries are trying to interfere with Canada's democratic processes. . \"Foreign actors are trying to undermine people's confidence in democracy itself,\" Mr Trudeau said.. Chinese officials in Canada have denied these reports, saying they do not interfere in Canadian election or internal affairs. Earlier this month, China's suspected surveillance efforts in North America dominated headlines after a Chinese balloon was discovered flying over North America.. Both the US and Canada said that the balloon was spying on sensitive military assets. China, however, has denied it was used for surveillance, instead saying it was a civilian weather balloon that had blown off course.. ",

That was Meteorologist Evelyn Taft of station KCAL. She's been covering California weather for nearly 14 years. She stresses this is a bizarre weather event for Southern California, known locally as SoCal. It's \"unbelievable\", she says.. As much as 5ft (1.5m) of snow could fall in the mountains with wind gusts up to 75mph (121km/h). The lower foothills, like Santa Clarita, will see a rare dusting of snow.. \"Never thought that my move to LA would involve storm coverage… with snow,\" tweeted KCAL anchor Sheba Turk. She shared a video of herself in nearby Lebec, California, as big flakes of snow landed on her jacket. \"Look at this,\" she says. \"You see the flurries?\". \"I had to stop and get gloves. I didn't even bring gloves to LA with me.\" . Meteorologist Paul Deanno warned his Twitter followers they might start to see snow starting late Wednesday night. That's \"not a typo\", he said.. \"First blizzard warning of my career,\" tweeted Autumn Robinson of Spectrum News 1.. \"...In So Cal,\" she continued. \"Cool I guess.\" . Snow may be rare in Southern California, but the area is no stranger to extreme weather. Wildfires regularly spread through the area, and a years-long drought was just interrupted in January by heavy rains and flooding. . Meteorologists in SoCal and elsewhere say such extreme weather events are likely to grow more severe as the climate changes.. ",

        "content": "The two Spectrum News 13 journalists were covering the killing of a woman in the area that morning when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . None of the three people killed in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",

That has put pressure on businesses and authorities to help people as their spending power shrinks.. Each year Japanese firms typically hold pay talks with unions for weeks before announcing their decisions around the middle of March.. The car makers have not said why this year's announcements were made earlier than usual.. On Wednesday, Toyota said it will meet union demands for pay and bonuses, with wages increasing by the most in 20 years.. Toyota's incoming president Koji Sato said that he hoped the move would have a positive impact across the Japan's motor industry and \"lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company.\". The company declined to provide further details when approached by the BBC.. Meanwhile, rival car maker Honda told the BBC that it had \"fully answered\" union requests for wage increases and bonuses.. The company said it will raise salaries by 5%, marking the biggest increase since 1990 and above Japan's rate of inflation.. A Honda spokesperson said the extra money will largely be distributed to younger employees as starting salaries are boosted.. \"Despite the severe business environment, management has a strong desire to create an environment in which all employees can... push forward with their work with a sense of urgency,\" the spokesperson added..
