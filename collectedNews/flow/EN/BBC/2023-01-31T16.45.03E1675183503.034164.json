        "content": "The attack, one of Pakistan's bloodiest in years, has left scores more injured.. A Pakistani Taliban claim to have carried out the bombing was later denied by the militant group, which blamed it on a splinter faction.. In the past the Pakistani Taliban have refrained from claiming some attacks on mosques, schools or markets because they say they are at war with security forces and not the Pakistani people, but many doubt such denials.. On Tuesday, rescuers scrambled to retrieve worshippers buried in the rubble, pulling out nine people alive but recovering more. No-one remained trapped, local officials said. . \"Terrorists want to create fear by targeting those who perform the duty of defending Pakistan,\" said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. He declared a national day of mourning.. The BBC saw ambulances racing in and out of the compound every few minutes. . More than 50 remain wounded, some of them critical. . Meanwhile, funerals have been carried out for more than 20 police officers, their coffins draped with the Pakistan flag. Most of the dead were members of the security forces.. Hundreds packed the funeral of Irfan Ullah, a police inspector killed in the explosion. Only a few days before, he had survived another attack - an ambush where some of his colleagues died. . Armed security guarded the prayers. Some attending cried quietly.. Mr Ullah left behind a wife and five children. At the graveside, his brother Muhammed Zahid described the family's pain.  . \"When we first heard that there had been a blast, we started to call him,\" Muhammed told our team. \"The phone was ringing out which initially gave us hope. But when we asked the police, they told us that he had been killed. The fourth body I saw was his.\". \"He was kind-hearted, friendly, ready to help others. He was also brave, he was never afraid of anything. We always used to tell him to be careful, but he used to reply: 'No, it's my duty'. It is a huge loss to our family.\". Between 300 and 400 police officers had been in the area at the time, Peshawar police chief Muhammad Ijaz Khan earlier told local media.  . The mosque is in one of the most heavily controlled areas of the city, which includes police headquarters and intelligence and counter-terrorism bureaus. On Tuesday, local media lined the road outside the gates - the closest that security would allow. . Mr Sharif said those behind the attack had \"nothing to do with Islam\". He added: \"The entire nation is standing united against the menace of terrorism.\". The Pakistan Taliban ended a ceasefire in November, and violence has been on the rise in the country since. It is separate to the Afghan Taliban but shares the same hard-line Islamist ideology. . Militant activity has risen in Pakistan since the Taliban .  and then seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.. This video can not be played. Watch: Chaotic scenes inside mosque after blast. There have been a number of attacks on Pakistani police and security personnel since the truce was abandoned. In December the Pakistani Taliban targeted a police station - like Peshawar, .  - which officials said had led to the deaths of 33 militants.. Monday's mosque blast took place around 13:30 (08:30 GMT) during afternoon prayers.. An entire wall of the building collapsed, and the mosque was covered in bricks and debris as people clambered over the rubble to escape.. Hours after the blast, BBC News witnessed a facility full of the injured, many still wearing their police uniforms.. Some were covered in burns cream, their skin red with burns from the explosion. Others have broken bones from being hit by falling rubble. . One man said he still could not hear because of the sound of the blast. Another man said he had been rescued after being trapped under the rubble for almost an hour. . The prime minister travelled to Peshawar on an emergency visit, where he will be briefed by local officials and visit those wounded by the blast.. UN Secretary General António Guterres condemned the attack, with his spokeswoman saying: \"It is particularly abhorrent that such an attack occurred at a place of worship.\". The attack on the mosque took place at the start of a key week for Pakistani diplomacy. . On Monday, the president of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was due to visit Islamabad - although the trip was cancelled at the last minute because of bad weather.. On Tuesday, an International Monetary Fund delegation is meant to visit Pakistan as part of the process to unlock a bailout loan to prevent the country from defaulting..

        "content": "Marches are taking place across France involving hundreds of thousands of people, after a first day of action attracted more than a million people.. Several cities have seen larger crowds than on 19 January.. The Macron government is pushing ahead with its pension age reforms in the face of opinion polls that suggest two-thirds of voters are opposed to the changes, which begin their passage through the National Assembly next week.. Without a majority in parliament, the government will have to rely on the right-wing Republicans for support as much as the ruling parties' own MPs.. Hours before the main protest began in the Place d'Italie in central Paris, thousands of marchers turned out in Toulouse, Marseille and Nice in the south, and Saint Nazaire, Nantes and Rennes in the west. . A reported 11,000 police were deployed to cover the demonstrations taking place in some 200 towns and cities.. \"Mr Macron is certain to lose,\" far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon told reporters in Marseille. \"Nobody wants his reforms, and the more the days go by, by the greater the opposition to them.\". Karima, 62, held up a placard in Paris highlighting that the government's plans hurt women far more than men: \"Lots of us already have broken careers and will have to work even longer than men in order to have a full pension.\". There was severe disruption to transport, with one in three high-speed trains running and only two driverless metro lines operating normally in Paris. Large crowds were reported on one of the main overground lines in the capital.. The CGT union said at least three-quarters of workers had walked out at the big TotalEnergies oil refineries and fuel depots, although the company said the number was far lower.. Power plants reported reduced production after workers went on strike at the main electricity company EDF.. One of the main teachers' unions said some 55% of secondary school teachers had walked out, although the government said the figure was just over a quarter. High school pupils staged protests outside some schools and students said they would occupy Sciences Po university in Paris in support of the strikers.. \"A lot of French people feel that working is more and more painful. It's not that they don't want to work, they don't want to work in these conditions,\" Sciences Po political scientist Bruno Palier told the BBC.. The government has indicated it may move some way on the detail of the reform but has refused to give in on the main thrust of the raising the retirement age by two years to 64.. \"Any kind of reform that is going to ask people to work longer will be unpopular, but we've been elected on this reform,\" said Christopher Weissberg, an MP in President Macron's Renaissance party. . At 62, France's retirement age is lower than most other countries in Western Europe. Italy and Germany have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while Spain's retirement age is 65 and in the UK it is 66.. In France, very few workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments, but there are now only 1.7 workers paying into the shared pension fund per person in retirement.. \"We have a universal system, and the system has to pay for itself. If not, it's weakening and if it's weakening, at some point, people will lose their pension,\" Mr Weissberg warned.. Economist Prof Philippe Aghion said the reforms were necessary because France had a structural deficit of some €13bn ($14bn; £11bn) and raising the retirement age would also help increase the rate of employment in France.. \"That will give the government credibility to make some investments that it needs to make in schooling, in the hospital system that it needs to improve, and more investment in innovation and green industrialisation,\" he told the BBC..

        "content": "Meanwhile, France's Emmanuel Macon said \"by definition, nothing is excluded\" ahead of meeting a Ukrainian minister.. Ukraine says advanced jets will help protect its skies from Russian attacks.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's top military officials say there should be no taboos on such military aid - but the US and its partners fear this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia. . On Tuesday, Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat was quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda news website as saying that Kyiv needed up to 200 multi-role fighter jets - such as F-16s - to defend its skies. . He said that Russia currently outnumbered Ukraine by five to six times in terms of the number of war planes.. The US-made F-16s would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets - mostly MiGs - Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991.. However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. Other Western allies have been been less definitive though. On Monday, President Macon did not rule out sending its war planes to Ukraine - but he stressed that it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is now in Paris, where he is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Macron and French military officials later on Tuesday.. Poland - another key ally of Ukraine - has also not ruled out sending F-16s to Kyiv. However, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any such move would only be possible \"in complete co-ordination\" with other Nato members.. The US announced last week it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, reversing its earlier stance on the issue. The UK and Germany also . Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said he was not aware of any formal request from Ukraine for aircraft, adding that \"the UK's Typhoon and F-35 jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly\". . \"Given that we believe it is not practical to send those jets to Ukraine.\". However, the spokesperson said Mr Sunak \"has had intensive discussions with military advisers\" and \"the conclusion is that given Russia's advantage in numbers a sustained war of attrition would not benefit Ukraine\".. Germany has also said it will not send fighter jets to Ukraine. . The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and is used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), according to the US Air Force. . The F-16's targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy.. Moscow has repeatedly accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy, warning that further escalation could trigger a nuclear war.. This video can not be played.

Vistara said in a statement that the flight's captain \"issued a warning card and made a decision to restrain the customer\" because of her behaviour..

        "content": "The court petition disputes a 2016 amendment to Lisa Marie's will that ousted Priscilla as the estate trustee. . The document misspelled her mother's name and had a signature that appeared unusual, Ms Presley's lawyers argue. . In a filing to the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for the 77-year-old said that she only became aware of the \"purported 2016 amendment\" after Lisa Marie's death. . Replacing her as trustee would mean she was no longer overseeing her daughter's assets.. It is not clear how much that estate is worth but various lawsuits in recent years suggest Lisa Marie's finances were in turmoil, . The amendment to her will that is now in question removes her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaces them with two of her children Riley, 33, and Benjamin Keough. . Benjamin Keough died in 2020 at the age of 27. Riley Keough is an actress with credits including 2020 film The Devil All the Time and the Amazon series The Terminal List.. According to the legal challenge, Ms Presley argues that the amendment was never delivered to her during her daughter's lifetime, as specifically required by the will. .

The legal action comes less than a week after the surviving family of Lisa Marie Presley attended a public memorial service for her at the family's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. .

        "content": "They still have no body to bury. No grave to visit. The last they heard from him was a phone call from prison, and he signed off with these words to his mother: \"Alright, I have to go. I'm glad you're OK.\"  . Neither had any inkling that it would be the last time they spoke.  . A month later, Mustafa was dead - one of 81 men killed on 12 March 2022, in the largest mass execution in modern Saudi history. . Mustafa's name is on a long and growing list put together by the campaign group Reprieve - which, along with the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, has been meticulously documenting Saudi executions for a new report.. Based on data collected since 2010, their study has found that:. Reprieve documented 147 executions in Saudi Arabia last year, but says there could well have been more. It also says the country has \"disproportionately\" used the death penalty against foreign nationals - including female domestic workers and low-level drug offenders. . Nearly a year on, officials haven't told Mustafa's family how he and the others were executed. His older brother, Yasser, says it has been a tragedy for the families. . \"We don't know whether they were given a decent burial or thrown in the desert or in the sea. We've no idea.\". Yasser is speaking publicly for the first time. He now lives in Germany, where he has been given political asylum after fleeing Saudi Arabia in 2016, fearing the same fate suffered by his brother.. Yasser says his brother was \"fun, sociable, and popular\". Since 2011, Mustafa took part in .  - led by the country's Shia minority - against the Saudi government. . He was detained in 2014. After his death, an official announcement said that he, along with 30 others, had been executed for the same string of offences - including attempted murder of security personnel, rape, robbery, bomb-making, stirring up strife and spreading chaos as well as trading in weapons and drugs.. \"They never provided any evidence. This lie cuts very deep,\" explains Yasser - who says his brother was still trying to appeal his conviction when the authorities executed him and the 80 other men.. \"Not only did they take their lives, they intentionally maligned them and accused them of things they've not done.\" . After rising to power, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi's de-facto ruler, promised to modernise the Kingdom - and suggested .  that his country, a key Western ally, was trying to \"minimise\" its use of the death penalty.. But, nearly five years on, Saudi Arabia remains one of the world's most prolific executioners - despite a lull that coincided with Saudi Arabia's presidency of the G20 and the start of the Covid pandemic. . The crown prince - known as MBS - has \"done the exact opposite of what he promised\" Reprieve's director, Maya Foa, tells me from her east London office. \"He has overseen vast numbers of executions and a brutal crackdown on people attending pro-democracy protests.\". What's more, she adds, there is a regime of secrecy around the death penalty, explaining that for many of the cases Reprieve have looked at, nobody knew they were even on death row.  . \"Their family members did not know. So you had people who were arrested, tried, sentenced to death and then executed in secret.\". Some families only discovered via social media that their loved ones had been killed, says Ms Foa - describing that lack of official information as one of the \"most cruel and distressing\" aspects of each case.. Traditionally, beheading has been the main method of execution in Saudi Arabia - the executions used to take place in public - with the names of those killed, and the charges they faced, published on government websites. . But human rights activists say the use of the death penalty has become much more opaque.. Nobody I spoke to knew exactly how executions are now carried out, though firing squads are also thought to be used. . The death penalty is part of a Saudi legal system which \"is unfair in its essence\", says Ali Adubisi, director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights. \"No type of independent civil society or human rights groups can operate there. If we weren't drawing attention to the executions, people would be killed in silence.\". Human Rights Watch said that 41 of the 81 men executed in March were from the Shia minority and that \".  in Saudi Arabia's criminal justice system suggest it is highly unlikely that any of the men received a fair trial\". They also heard reports of torture.. When Yasser was first allowed to visit Mustafa, 12 months after his arrest in 2014, he was shocked by what he saw.. \"Even though it had been a year since we had last seen him, he couldn't even stand up to greet us.. \"He'd fall over as soon as he tried - and when we asked him, he said it was because of torture. . \"We saw bruises on his body and he told us he'd been given electric shocks.\"   . The sister of another detainee told me her brother had also been badly tortured. . \"He said he was strung up by his feet and beaten. He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" says Zainab Abu Al-Khair, whose brother Hussein has been in prison since 2014. . Hussein - a Jordanian driver working for a wealthy Saudi family - was arrested with drugs in his car on the Jordan-Saudi border. Zainab is certain they were not his.  . Speaking from her home in Canada, she explains how Hussein's family have been struggling to make ends meet since his arrest. He has a disabled son and, after he was imprisoned, his 14-year-old daughter was \"sold into marriage\" in Jordan.. Last November, Saudi Arabia ended an unofficial moratorium on the death penalty for drug offences - a move described by the UN Human Rights Office as \"deeply regrettable\". Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed for such offences, . . . In prison, says Zainab, men have since been taken from Hussein's cell never to return. . It has left both Hussein and Zainab terrified. \"I can't even talk about him without my heart pounding,\" she told me. . \"I think of him all day and at night, I have bad dreams. The thought they might chop off his head - it's barbarity.. \"You can't imagine how hard it is. Sometimes I just sit alone and cry, cry, cry.\". Part of the anger she is feeling is directed at other countries for allowing Saudi Arabia \"to get away with it\". . Last March - four days after the mass execution of 81 men - the then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson met Mohammed bin Salman to try to persuade him to pump more oil to replace Russian fuel imports. Downing Street said Mr Johnson did raise concerns about Saudi Arabia's ongoing human rights issues.. Since coming to power, MBS has carried out social and economic reforms - including allowing women to drive - but they've been accompanied by intensified political repression.. The .  describes Saudi Arabia's human rights record as \"deplorable\" - a stain on its reputation, which it is busy trying to \"launder\" through sports and entertainment.. The BBC has sent three emails to the Saudi Human Rights Commission - a Saudi government organisation - asking to speak to an official, but has received no replies. . A statement to the BBC from the Saudi embassy in London noted that many other nations around the world have the death penalty, and that countries have different views about what penalties are appropriate. It said: \"As we respect their right to determine their own laws and customs, we hope that others will respect our sovereign right to follow our own judicial and legislative choices.\". But the comments failed to address the steep rise in executions under the crown prince, MBS, or the way the death penalty is being used, in contravention of international norms.. The UN Human Rights Office told the BBC it was \"deeply concerned about the trend in the use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia\".. \"In particular, we are concerned by the increase in the number of death sentences issued and upheld, including against child offenders, and for offences that do not meet the 'most serious crimes' threshold of international law, such as drug-related offences,\" it said.. For those whose loved ones are in prison, it's a desperately anxious time. Hussein's sister keeps a vigilant eye on the family chat group. . \"It's not a life to deal with this stress,\" she says. \"Every morning, every evening, we have to check he's still alive.\". ",
