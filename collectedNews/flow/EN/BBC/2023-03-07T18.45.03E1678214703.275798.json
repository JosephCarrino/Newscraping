        "content": "In the video, the Ukrainian soldier is seen smoking a cigarette in a trench. He says \"Glory to Ukraine!\" before being shot with automatic weapons.. One military unit has named the soldier as one of its own, but there are conflicting reports about his identity.. In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the prisoner of war (POW) is shot dead. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The video first emerged on social media on Monday. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.. The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said: \"The shooting of an unarmed prisoner is a cynical and brazen disregard for the norms of international humanitarian law and the customs of war. This is what worthless murderers do, not warriors. . \"The Russian occupiers have once again shown that their main goal in Ukraine is the brutal extermination of Ukrainians.\". Russia has not publicly commented on the incident.. In his video address, President Zelensky said \"the occupiers\" killed \"a warrior who bravely said to their faces: 'Glory to Ukraine!'\". \"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\". Mr Zelensky was referring to a battle cry in Ukraine's military that has become popular among millions of Ukrainians.. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the footage was \"another proof this war is genocidal\", and he called for an \"immediate investigation\" by the International Criminal Court.. And Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said a criminal investigation had already been opened.. On Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information. . His unit, the 30th Separate Mechanised Brigade, said he was last seen on 3 February near the eastern city of Bakhmut - the scene of fierce fighting in recent months.. But it added that the identification could only be completed after the body was returned.. Before the soldier was named, Mr Shadura's sister, Olia, said she recognised her brother: \"[He] would certainly be capable of standing up to the Russians like that,\" she told the BBC.. However, there is some doubt over the identity of the soldier, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else. . Mr Shadura's sister later told the BBC that she was not collecting money on behalf of relatives due to the conflicting reports on the unarmed soldier's identity.. \"I recognise my brother in that video. But if that's not him, then I feel for his relatives, and in that case can someone help me to find my brother?\". Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes since President Vladimir Putin launched a full scale-invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russia denies the allegations.. Ukraine has previously accused Russian troops of torturing, raping and killing Ukrainian prisoners of war.. Last July, a video emerged that showed a captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. The Russian soldier filmed carrying out the attack in the town of Severodonetsk was identified as a member of a unit belonging to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.. In November, Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of executing a group of Russian prisoners.. It followed a video from the front line in eastern Ukraine showing the apparent surrender of a number of soldiers, in an incident that ended in their deaths.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "Mr Qin, China's former ambassador to the US, held his first press conference as foreign minister on Tuesday.. The .  has heightened tensions between the superpowers despite recent efforts to improve ties. . \"It [the US] regards China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. This is like the first button in the shirt being put wrong,\" said Mr Qin, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament in Beijing. . The foreign minister was responding to a question on whether a healthy China-US relationship was still possible as differences between the countries grew.. The US called for establishing \"guardrails\", but what it really wants is for China to not hit back with words or actions when provoked, Mr Qin added. . He was referring to US President Joe Biden's comments last month that the US would \"compete fully with China but [is] not looking for conflict\". . Mr Qin said: \"If the US does not put on the brakes and continues to roar down the wrong road, no amount of guardrails can stop the derailment and overturning, and it is bound to fall into conflict and confrontation. Who will bear its disastrous consequences?\" . He also said the diplomatic crisis caused by the balloon incident could have been averted but the US acted with \"the presumption of guilt\". . Washington has previously described the suspected spy balloon as a \"clear violation of US sovereignty\". Beijing admitted the object belonged to them, but said it was . . . The BBC's Gordon Corera breaks down what we know about spy balloons.  (UK only). Relations between the two countries deteriorated during former US President Donald Trump's administration, which launched a trade war against China in 2018. The two superpowers continue to clash on various issues, including Taiwan, China's militarisation of the South China Sea and the origins of Covid.. Mr Qin's comments follow Chinese President Xi Jinping's unusually direct rebuke of the US on Monday.. Mr Xi said \"Western countries led by the US had implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China and that this brought \"severe challenges\" to the country.. On Tuesday, Mr Qin said an \"invisible hand\" was driving the Ukraine crisis but did not name any country or individual. He reiterated that China had not provided weapons to either side of the Russia-Ukraine war and called for peace talks to resume.. However, he asked: \"Why should the US demand that China refrain from supplying arms to Russia when it sells arms to Taiwan?\". The Ukraine crisis has reached a \"critical juncture\", he said.. \"Either a ceasefire will stop the war, restore peace and embark on a political settlement, or fuel the fire, expand the crisis and drag it into the abyss of losing control.\". Mr Qin, 56, was named China's foreign minister in December 2022 and is one of the youngest appointees to this post in the country's history. He replaced Wang Yi, who was promoted to the politburo of the ruling Communist Party in October that year.. A trusted aide of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr Qin is well known as a tough-talking diplomat. . ",
