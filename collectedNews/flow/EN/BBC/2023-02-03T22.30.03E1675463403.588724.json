        "content": "Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. A senior State Department official said conditions were not right at this time for what would have been the first high level US-China meeting there in years.. A Chinese apology was noted, the official said, but described the balloon as a clear violation of sovereignty and international law.. The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China. America's top diplomat was set to visit Beijing on 5 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. . But there was consternation on Thursday when US defence officials announced they were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United States. . The incident starkly highlighted the roiling tensions that the visit sought to address, with China's expression of regret not enough to dispel the administration's need to respond to the spying suspicions. . A senior state department official said that the balloon would have \"narrowed the agenda\" of any meetings with Chinese officials \"in a way that would have been unhelpful and unconstructive\". . While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, \"travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic\" and did \"not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground\", its presence sparked outrage.. Former US President Donald Trump was among those calling for the US military to shoot it down.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. A statement from China's Foreign Ministry said that it regretted the incident and would work with the US to resolve the issue.. However, the state department official said that while the US acknowledged China's claim about the balloon's purpose, it stood by the assessment that it was being used for surveillance. . Another trip by Mr Blinken to China would be planned \"at the earliest opportunity\"  another senior state department official said, adding that Washington planned to maintain \"open lines of communication\" about the incident. . The official added that the State Department had informed close US allies about the violation of US airspace.  . In a statement, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada - the country's foreign ministry - said that it had summoned China's ambassador over the incident and will  \"vigorously express\" its position to Chinese officials.. Mr Blinken had been expected to visit China on 5 and 6 February. . A White House spokesperson said that US President Joe Biden agreed with Mr Blinken's decision and that there was \"consensus\" that it was \"not appropriate\" to go to China at this time. . Mr Biden did not take questions about the balloon following remarks about the US economy on Friday morning. . According to US officials, the balloon flew over Alaska and Canada before appearing in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive military missile sites. . By Friday morning, the balloon was moving east \"over the centre of the continental US\" at an altitude of about 60,000ft (18,200m) according to Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. . Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said on Twitter that the balloon was over the north-eastern part of his state early on Friday afternoon.  . General Ryder added that US officials are monitoring the object and reviewing \"options\". He said the balloon - which he described as \"manoeuvrable\" - poses no military or physical threat to people on the ground. . Although fighter planes were alerted, the US decided not to shoot the object down due to the dangers of falling debris, officials said. . The incident has also revealed as much about domestic politics as it did about as geopolitical rivalries, with Mr Biden's political opponents leading the charge in demanding action against China. . Several Republican lawmakers - as well as former President Donald Trump - have criticised the decision and urged the US to down the balloon. . \"Shoot down the balloon,\" Mr Trump said in a short message on his Truth Social social media platform. . On Twitter, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the balloon incident was \"a destabilizing action that must be addressed\". . As the situation continues, the Biden administration must now contend with China \"hawks\" on both sides of the political spectrum. . Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester, for example, said in a statement that he is \"still waiting on real answers\" about how the \"unacceptable\" incident happened. . \"I will hold everyone accountable until I get them,\" the statement said. . Speaking to CBS, a US official described the payload of the balloon - the attached part from which surveillance is carried out - as being as large as two or three school buses. The balloon itself is significantly larger. . Chinese officials have previously publicly expressed interest in the potential military and intelligence-gathering potential of balloons. . \"Technological advances have opened a new door for the use of balloons,\" an article in the military-run Liberation Army Daily said last year. . In 2022, Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected Chinese balloons over its territory. . ",

        "content": "The package includes ground-launched small-diameter bombs (GLSDB) which can hit targets 150km (93 miles) away.. But officials refused to be drawn on speculation that the munitions could be used to attack parts of annexed Crimea. . \"When it comes to Ukrainian plans on operations, clearly that is their decision,\" Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters. . \"This gives them a longer-range capability, long-range fires capability, that will enable them, again, to conduct operations in defence of their country and take back their sovereign territory, Russian-occupied areas.\". Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and considers it part of its territory. But it has come under sporadic fire from Ukrainian forces in recent months. . Western nations have repeatedly ruled out providing Ukraine with offensive weapons - such as fighter jets - which it could use to strike against Russia itself. . In a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US and President Joe Biden for the additional aid. . \"The more long-range our weapons are and the more mobile our troops are, the sooner Russia's brutal aggression will end,\" Mr Zelensky wrote. \"Together with [the US] we stand against terror.\" . Previously, Ukraine's longest range weapon was the Himars rocket system, which can hit targets at a range of up to 80km (50 miles). Kyiv used the system to devastating effect during its counter-offensive in the south and east earlier this year. . The GLSDB also gives Ukraine forces an ability to strike anywhere in the Russian-occupied Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also allows Ukraine to threaten Russian supply lines in the east. . Manufactured by Boeing and Saab, GLSDB is a gliding rocket with a small bomb attached, capable of striking a target within one metre of its position. . And it can be fired from a variety of weapons systems, including the Himars and M270 MLRS systems already in use in Ukraine. However, both the Pentagon and Boeing refused to comment on delivery dates for the system, with some reports suggesting that it could take up to nine months before it reaches Ukraine. . The new package - which will also include additional Himars missiles and 250 Javelin anti-armour systems - comes amid mounting concerns that Western nations have been too slow to provide fresh military aid to Ukraine. . \"GLSDB should have been approved last fall, US House of Representatives Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers said in a tweet. \"Every day it's not approved is a day it's delayed getting it into the hands of a Ukrainian ready to kill a Russian.\". In recent days, reports have emerged that a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region has been gaining momentum, with pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that the town of Bakhmut, long a focal point of Russian attacks, has been surrounded from three-sides. . But President Zelensky said his forces were entrenched around the town and would not surrender it to Russian assaults. . \"We consider Backhmut to be our fortress,\" the Ukrainian leader said. \"If weapon [deliveries] are accelerated - namely long-range weapons - we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014.\". Mr Zelensky said earlier that a long-rumoured Russian spring offensive in the region had already begun and his Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said earlier this week that .  for the renewed assault. . Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leader has been holding new EU accession talks with the bloc's leaders, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, in Kyiv. . Speaking after the summit, Mr Zelensky said the leaders had reached an \"understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year\". . But Ms von der Leyen said there were \"no rigid timelines\" in place and emphasised that Ukraine had political goals it must meet before joining the block. . The EU has repeatedly underlined the need for Ukraine to step up its fight against endemic corruption, reform its judiciary by weeding out political interference and strengthen its economy.. Elsewhere, Germany has announced plans to send Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine. The earlier model of the Leopard 2s - which Berlin has already promised to provide - can be delivered to Kyiv sooner than the advanced model. . ",
