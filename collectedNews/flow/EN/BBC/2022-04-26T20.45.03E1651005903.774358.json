The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, saying locals do not benefit.. It would be the first time a suicide attack by the BLA has been carried out by a female militant. The group has targeted Chinese nationals on a number of occasions, as has the Pakistani Taliban. . China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in resource-rich Balochistan province.. China's embassy in Pakistan confirmed that three of the country's citizens had been killed in Tuesday's blast. Pakistan's government condemned what it called a \"cowardly terrorist attack\".. The dead included the director of the Confucius Institute, a Chinese government-run body which offers language and cultural programmes overseas, and two other faculty members in Karachi.. CCTV footage showed a woman standing outside the gate of the institute as the van arrives, followed by a powerful explosion.. The BLA released a photo of a woman in fatigues raising two fingers in salute who it said had carried out the attack, and named her as Shariah Baloch alias Bramsh. . Local media reported that the bomber had been a student at the university.. Balochistan, rich in natural resources but Pakistan's poorest province, is home to a long-running insurgency.. It is being transformed by major Chinese infrastructure projects on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries which forms part of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road initiative..

        "content": "Gazprom has justified the suspension under new rules announced last month, . . . PGNiG has refused to do this. . PGNiG relies on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from the Russian company in the first quarter of this year.. It described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas. . Following the news, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. . Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. . PGNiG said its underground gas storage is almost 80% full and with summer approaching demand is lower.. Poland also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas terminal (LNG) in Swinoujscie. . And on 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal.. It can also buy gas on the European spot market and get it delivered through pipelines to Germany and the Czech Republic. . However, if Russian gas supplies remain suspended for several weeks, the country will probably have to start restricting supply to the country's largest consumers, such as chemical manufacturers, the BBC's Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton said. . Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. . And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the \"Baltic Pipe\", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries..

        "content": "The increase in prices \"is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects\", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC.. He said \"households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis\". . \"We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,\" the senior economist at the World Bank added. . Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. . The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year.. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen \"the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike\", when .  sent prices soaring.. Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. . Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said \"disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect\" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. . Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving to . . That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere.. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at their .  60 years ago.. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically.. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. . Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall.. \"Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,\" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season.. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, \"equate to about 10 days of world food supply\". . This video can not be played. The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. . As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: \"We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years\".. Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means \"there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline\". . For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: \"While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast.\". It added that \"the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine\" and the disruption it causes to supply chains..
