        "content": "Authorities launched an overnight rescue operation after the girl's parents - who had been working in a nearby field - raised the alarm. . She was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries, officials said. . \"She has signs of fatigue but still has good vital signs,\" local police chief Ratsaran Ketsoising told AFP.. Panic was sparked after the baby girl - who is said to be the daughter of two Myanmarese migrants - fell through a 30cm (12in) wide gap at the top of the well. . The baby's parents said they had taken her to work with them at a tapioca farm in the Khiri Rat sub-district. They said they had left her under a tree while they worked. . But they raised the alarm after they were unable to find the child during their break and heard cries coming from the nearby well. . Rescue teams were forced to work through the night using a mechanical digger, with which they dug a 10m deep pit adjacent to the well shaft. . Oxygen was pumped into the well to allow the child to breathe. Images at the scene showed rescue workers in hard hats working at the bottom of a deep pit.. But authorities told local media that they feared that the well could collapse in on itself and harm the child if they continued to use the digger, so they used hand-held shovels to remove the final few metres of earth. . PBS Thailand reported that rescue workers reached the child at about 08:00 local time (01:00 GMT), but were unable to pull her out immediately, as she appeared to have suffered an injury to her leg. . However, cheers erupted shortly afterwards from the assembled rescue workers after the girl was finally pulled from the well. . \"We are so glad we could rescue her safely,\" rescue worker Chanachart Wancharernrung told reporters. \"We have been trying since yesterday afternoon. We worked without sleep. Everyone helped out.\". ",

        "content": "Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year.. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a \"revenge killing\".. Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused.. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as \"low-risk\".. He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom.. \"From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,\" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency.. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities.. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them.. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims.. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases.. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament.. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker.. ",

        "content": "A teenager was also killed in the attack. Police are still investigating the possible motive behind it. . A member of Mr Menéndez's party is expected to replace the murdered politician as mayor.. The municipal elections were held during an escalating crime wave linked to the growing influence of violent drug gangs in the Andean country. . Mr Menéndez was not the only politician to be killed in the run-up to the election. Two weeks earlier, the candidate for mayor of the coastal town of Salinas, Julio César Farachio, was also shot dead.. Police have arrested a suspect in Farachio's murder who had previously threatened the 45-year-old candidate. . The suspect had recently been released from prison after serving a sentence for drug trafficking, local media reported.. No arrests have been made so far in the fatal shooting of Omar Menéndez, whose assailants fled on a motorbike. . President Guillermo Lasso condemned the murders.. The president, a conservative banker, has been grappling with the rising number of homicides in Ecuador. . He has proposed a series of changes to the constitution which were put to voters on Sunday. . One of them was to allow Ecuadoreans with links to transnational organised crime to be extradited abroad if they are facing a trial in another country or have already been sentenced in absentia.. With many jails in Ecuador overwhelmed by the recent crime wave, some officials argue that extraditing convicted criminals to maximum security jails in the United States would be a safer and cheaper option for the Ecuadorean justice system.. Neighbouring Colombia amended its constitution in 1997 to this effect and has sent many a notorious drug lord to the US since. . Colombian officials say the vehemence with which the drug barons fight against their extradition suggests they see a sentence in a US jail - where they have no ties and no influence over guards and prison directors - as a particularly harsh punishment. . But the proposal to change Ecuador's constitution to allow for the extradition of Ecuadoreans narrowly failed, with 51% of voters rejecting it. . President Lasso said he accepted the result, saying that \"when the people speak, it's our duty to analyse, understand, and accept it\".. ",

        "content": "Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an . But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success.. The UK's .  said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation.. But the UK said \"it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks\".. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been \"liberated\" in recent weeks and operations were progressing \"with success\" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar.. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000. . Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward.. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. \"We are countering them,\" he said on Monday night.. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could \"prove themselves\" against current threats from Russia.. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation. . Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured .  north of Bakhmut after an intense battle.. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove.. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range.. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and \"could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation\".. ",
