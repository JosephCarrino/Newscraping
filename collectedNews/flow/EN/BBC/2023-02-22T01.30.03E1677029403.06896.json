        "content": "Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. In a week heavy with events ahead of Friday's anniversary of Russia's Ukraine invasion, Mr Putin spoke first.. The West had enabled Nazi Germany, he claimed, and had turned Ukraine into a neo-Nazi regime that was \"anti-Russia\".. Hours later Mr Biden said autocrats understood only one word: \"No, no, no!\". \"Putin thought the world would roll over, he was wrong,\" he said, vowing that Nato was more united than ever. Kyiv stood strong, proud, tall and free and Western support for Ukraine would not fail, he added. . Welcoming him to Warsaw's royal castle, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that by travelling to Kyiv Mr Biden had shown the free world did not fear anything. Nato's role was to defend and support the free world and Ukraine \"must win this war\".. Mr Putin's speech barely touched on the progress of Russia's military in Ukraine and there was no indication of how the war might end. The main news involving Russia's military came from Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who accused the chief of staff and defence minister of trying to destroy his group and starve it of weapons.. Russia's president did announce he was suspending the New Start nuclear arms control treaty signed with the US in 2010. The deal caps nuclear warhead numbers and Nato, and UK leaders have urged him to reconsider.. He also declared he had put new ground-based systems on combat duty. He had already threatened last year to use \"all means at our disposal\" to protect Russia and territory it has seized in Ukraine.. Truth was an early casualty of Mr Putin's lengthy speech, at an exhibition centre a stone's throw from the Kremlin.. \"They were the ones who started the war... we're using force to stop it,\" . . . No Western troops have been on the ground in Ukraine, but Russia's foreign ministry appeared to double down on the claim when it summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy on Tuesday, saying that Washington should take steps to withdraw \"US-Nato military and equipment\" from Ukraine.. Mr Putin has blamed the West and Nato countless times in the past, and he reprised many of his claims from his TV address on the day of the invasion a year ago. He reminded Russians of the war in Iraq and the bombing of Belgrade, but steered clear of Russia's long and devastating role in the Syrian civil war, its invasion of neighbouring Georgia or landgrab in Crimea.. As he spoke there was a deadly reminder of the human cost of Europe's most deadly invasion since World War Two.. Six people died and many more were wounded as Russian shells hit Kherson city, liberated from Russian troops last November. A bus stop, a pharmacy and residential areas were hit in the city centre and local media said a kindergarten was among the buildings that came under attack.. In his nightly address on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attacks \"did not and could not have any military purpose\", and were instead intended to sow \"terror\".. He added that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the front line in eastern Ukraine - where the bulk of the current fighting is taking place - despite facing great pressure. . Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.. The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.. Each side's limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.. Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world's nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.. President Biden visited Warsaw a day after he had gone to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky, in a highly complex security operation. . The Polish president said the visit had sent \"an extremely important political signal, primarily for Ukraine\", but it was also a sign that the free world and the president of the US was with them and did not forget.. Mr Biden reserved much of his praise for Mr Zelensky and the Ukrainians who had reclaimed land captured during the first weeks of the war.. But he also had words of support for Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, over allegations that Russia was plotting to overthrow the current government. . President Putin on Tuesday stoked tensions in Moldova by cancelling a 2012 decree that backed Moldova's sovereignty in solving the future of a breakaway region of Moldova called Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.. President Biden is due to meet leaders of nine countries on Nato's eastern flank on Wednesday, and he went out of his way to reaffirm American backing for one of the alliance's key pledges.. Under its Article 5, members of Nato pledge to defend any other member that comes under attack. Mr Biden said US commitment both to the alliance and Article 5 was  \"rock solid\".. \"Every member of Nato knows it and Russia knows it as well - an attack against one is an attack against all.\". Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, followed up Mr Biden's visit to Kyiv on Tuesday with her first trip to Ukraine. Visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, where Russian troops murdered hundreds of civilians, she said Ukrainians could count on Italy: \"We have been with you since the start and we will be until the end.\".

        "content": "Norfolk Southern is now facing multiple lawsuits filed on behalf of residents, many of whom were forced to evacuate their homes. . It has apologised for the incident. . The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the power to fine or sanction firms over environmental concerns, said Norfolk Southern would \"pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they've inflicted on this community\".. Speaking at a news conference in East Palestine, the head of the EPA Michael Regan said the company would have to find and clean contaminated soil and water supplies and pay back the EPA for its own cleaning efforts, provide information online for residents and take part in public meetings at the EPA's request. . The EPA will also \"review and approve\" Norfolk Southern's work plan with the input of state and local authorities. . \"Full transparency is the only option,\" Mr Regan said, adding that in \"no way, shape or form will Norfolk Southern get off the hook\". . If Norfolk Southern failed to comply, the EPA would \"immediately\" carry out the work itself, charge them triple the cost of the clean-up operations and fine the firm up to an additional $70,000 (Â£58,000) a day. . Authorities in both Ohio and Pennsylvania have also suggested that further legal actions may follow. . In the aftermath of the derailment, residents of East Palestine have reported ailments including headaches and nausea, and expressed fears that local water supplies are potentially harmful despite the repeated assurances of state, local and federal officials that the water is safe. Earlier on Tuesday, the Ohio Health Department opened a health clinic for concerned residents.. At the news conference, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also said that Norfolk Southern \"needs to be made to pay\" for any medical costs stemming from the derailment. . Mr DeWine also called for longer-term changes to how railroads operate, calling it \"absurd\" and \"fundamentally wrong\" that a train carrying potentially hazardous chemicals was not required to alert local authorities when it was in transit through their areas. . \"That has to be changed,\" he said. \"We're going to do everything we can.\" . Last week, Norfolk Southern came under intense criticism from East Palestine residents after company representatives failed to appear at a town hall meeting aimed at easing fears.. A local resident, Logan Rance, told the BBC that the EPA's announcement will be welcome news for many in East Palestine. . \"I'm certainly happy to see that. Hopefully they [Norfolk Southern] will be held accountable for their actions. It's reassuring to know the ball is rolling,\" Ms Rance said. \"But I can only feel so much better. The damage has already been done in my opinion.\" . The company said it was concerned about a \"growing physical threat\" to its employees from \"outside parties\" who may have been in attendance. . CEO Alan Shaw has since apologised for the derailment and vowed that the company will \"not walk away\" from East Palestine. . Former US President Donald Trump plans to visit the town on Wednesday and is expected to criticise the federal government's response to the derailment and chemical spill. . More than two weeks after the derailment, the incident has become a politically contentious issue. Senior Republicans have cited the response to the derailment as evidence that the federal government is neglecting domestic issues. . Earlier this week, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway told Fox News that US President Joe Biden had given a \"slap in the face\" to the town by travelling to Ukraine rather than Ohio. . \"That tells you right now, he doesn't care about us,\" he said. .

        "content": "GarcÃ­a Luna - who was arrested in the state of Texas in 2019 - had pleaded not guilty. . The 54-year-old could face life in prison. . At a minimum, GarcÃ­a Luna will serve the mandatory minimum of 20 years, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. . The verdict came after a four-week trial and three days of jury deliberation in the US District Court in Brooklyn, New York. . Prosecutors said the former head of the Mexican equivalent of the US Federal Bureau of Investigations accepted millions of dollars stuffed in briefcases and delivered by members of JoaquÃ­n \"El Chapo\" GuzmÃ¡n's Sinaloa drug cartel.. GarcÃ­a Luna, who moved to the US after leaving office, is the highest-ranking Mexican official ever to be tried in the US. . On Twitter, a spokesperson for current Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Cuevas, praised the decision and took aim at former Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n. . GarcÃ­a Luna served under Mr CalderÃ³n, who oversaw a crackdown on drug cartels beginning in 2006. . \"Justice has arrived for the former squire of Felipe CalderÃ³n,\" Mr Ramirez Cuevas wrote. \"The crimes against our people will never be forgotten.\". Ioan Grillo, a Mexico-based British author and expert on Mexico's criminal underworld, told BBC News the conviction has \"big implications\" for both the US and Mexico governments' fight against corruption and organised crime. . \"This could encourage prosecutors to go after other cases,\" he said. \"They took a certain risk by not having physical evidence and convicting him on testimony from drug traffickers.\" . He added GarcÃ­a Luna's conviction could also help dissuade Mexican officials from being \"openly corrupt\". . \"If you're a Mexican agent, you'll be thinking about how much you expose yourself to the Americans,\" he said.. The ex-minister - widely considered the architect of Mexico's war on drugs - was said to have shared information with the Sinaloa drug cartel about its rivals and warned the group about law enforcement operations.. GarcÃ­a Luna denied the allegations. . The claims against GarcÃ­a Luna's involvement with the Sinaloa cartel first came to light during a trial against GuzmÃ¡n, who was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years in 2019. . A former cartel member named Jesus \"Rey\" Zambada testified during GuzmÃ¡n's trial that he had delivered millions of dollars in payments to GarcÃ­a Luna.. The case against the former minister was built on the testimony of nine cooperating witnesses, mostly convicted cartel members, including Zambada. . GarcÃ­a Luna declined to testify at the trial, but his wife, Linda Cristina Pereyra, took the stand and attempted to downplay their finances and lifestyle. . In her closing argument, US prosecutor Saritha Komatireddy said the Sinaloa cartel could not have built a \"global cocaine empire\" without GarcÃ­a Luna's aid.. \"They paid the defendant bribes for protection,\" she said. \"And they got what they paid for.\". GarcÃ­a Luna's lawyers argued the witnesses were testifying against him to \"save themselves\" after committing \"horrific crimes\". . Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official, said the conviction would come as no surprise to those closely following the trial in Mexico. . \"It was certainly enough to convince the jury, although many others will be unconvinced,\" he told BBC News. . The conviction could \"complicate some parts\" of US-Mexico cooperation, he said. . \"There won't be any sort of rupture or open dispute,\" he added. \"But ... it will be known that the US has its eyes on Mexican officials. For some, that will make things difficult.\" . ",
