        "content": "The US is scrutinising its airspace more closely since the recent incursion of a suspected spy balloon from China.. Beijing has alleged that Washington is flying its own balloons over China.. China's foreign ministry said on Monday that the US has flown balloons into its airspace more than 10 times in the past year.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.. Speaking from the White House, Mr Kirby denied the allegation: \"We are not flying surveillance balloons over China. I'm not aware of any other craft we're flying into Chinese airspace.\". On 4 February, a high-altitude balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina after moving for days over the continental US.. US officials said it originated in China and had been used to monitor sensitive military sites, but China denied the object was used for spying and said it was a weather monitoring device that had blown astray.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three further high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Michigan - and the administration has been under pressure to explain what the objects were.. Mr Kirby, who leads communications for the president's National Security Council, said there were differences between the alleged Chinese spy balloon and the three objects downed over the weekend.. He said the latter did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\" but were taken down \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\".. Efforts are currently under way to collect debris from where the objects fell, but Mr Kirby noted the objects in Alaska and Canada are in remote terrain and will be difficult to find in winter weather conditions, while the object in Michigan lies in the deep waters of Lake Huron.. Officials have not yet been able to \"definitively assess\" what these objects are but have not ruled out the possibility they were conducting surveillance, he said. . He claimed that Beijing is operating a \"balloon programme for intelligence collection\" that has ties to the Chinese military and was not detected during the Trump administration.. \"We detected it. We tracked it, and we have been carefully studying it to learn as much as we can,\" he said.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds.

Video showed workers cheering and shouting \"God is great\" as she was lifted out of the darkness. . Several others were saved on Monday, including a 13-year-old boy trapped for 182 hours. But rescues are becoming rarer as the death toll passes 35,000.. This is partly due to limits on how long the human body can survive without water.. Other factors include how much space the trapped person has to breathe and how bad their injuries are, an emergency medicine specialist told the BBC.. Prof Tony Redmond also said the cold temperatures in Turkey and Syria were a double-edged sword.. If you are very cold, your blood vessels shrink and you can last a little longer from your injuries, he explained. But getting too cold is harmful in itself.. The death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria is expected to rise dramatically, with the United Nations' humanitarian chief warning it could double. . Miray - the young girl rescued on Monday in the city of Adiyaman - was attached to a stretcher and carried away by rescue workers. Local media reported teams on the ground were hoping to find her older sister.. In hard-hit Hatay province, 13-year-old Kaan was rescued after being trapped for 182 hours - as well as a woman called Naide Umay, found alive after 175 hours.. In the city of Kahramanmaras, rescue workers had made contact with a grandmother, mother and baby - all stuck, but alive - and were working to reach them.. Thousands of teams across the region - including coal miners and experts using thermal cameras and sniffer dogs - have been scouring the remains of collapsed buildings to find remaining survivors.. But hopes of finding people alive are dwindling and there is a sense that the rescue mission will soon end.. The focus is shifting to recovery, with officials looking at shelter, food and healthcare.. Questions are also being raised about . .. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but during one visit to a disaster zone last week, he appeared to blame fate.. Officials say they have issued .  in connection with the construction of buildings that collapsed, with 12 people taken into custody, including contractors.. ",

        "content": "If passed, they would curb the Supreme Court's power and give the government more say over judicial appointments.. Critics say it will undermine democracy; the government argues the reforms will strengthen it.. \"I feel very distressed, very nervous, I have a lot of sleepless nights,\" said Helit from Ness Tziona, south of Tel Aviv, who came with her daughter. . \"I think they will change. I hope so... but I think [it will be] only for a while. Then things will change again for the worse.\". Dore, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, was one of thousands whose offices shut to enable staff to attend the protests.. \"I'm here because my heart has been torn to pieces seeing what the new government is doing to Israeli democracy,\" he said.. \"You know they are tearing apart the spirit of this country. And they are threatening the power of the legal systems. I cannot see it happening without protesting against it.\" . In an unusual step, US President Joe Biden appeared to criticise the proposals in their current form .  - a rarity for a US leader to express an opinion on constitutional matters in Israel.. Israel's own President, Isaac Herzog, warned that the country was on the verge of constitutional and social collapse. Involvement by Israeli presidents in political issues are also rare since the post is considered to be a politically neutral figurehead.. Monday's demonstrations are the latest in weekly mass protests against the reforms. Opponents say the plans will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the current system where laws passed by an elected parliament can be overturned by the Supreme Court is undemocratic.. Among the planned reforms, the ability of the Supreme Court to strike down laws would be severely weakened. A simple majority in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) would also have the power to override court rulings. . The reforms would also give the government more influence over the committee which appoints judges, including to the Supreme Court.. Israel's Justice Minister Yariv Lavin, who introduced the plans, accused opponents - including the attorney general and Supreme Court's chief justice - of seeking to \"carry out a coup\" against Mr Netanyahu, after a petition was filed to the court to declare the prime minister unfit for office..

It comes after the US on 4 February shot down a suspected spy balloon over its airspace - which China said was one of its weather balloons gone astray.. Relations between the two countries have since deteriorated. In recent days, the US has also shot down a number of other unidentified objects.. Questioned on Monday, Beijing said the US had made many airspace breaches.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing.. \"Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities.\". \"The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,\" he added.. He said Beijing had responded to the incursions in a \"responsible and professional\" manner. . \"If you want to know more about US high-altitude balloons illegally entering China's airspace, I suggest you refer to the US side,\" he said.. Chinese state-affiliated media reported over the weekend that an unidentified flying object had been spotted off the country's east coast, with the military preparing to shoot it down.. The White House denied Beijing's accusation that it sent balloons over China to conduct surveillance, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson . The first balloon incident led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The top diplomat called China's alleged high-altitude spying \"unacceptable and irresponsible\".. On Sunday, the US ordered an unmanned \"octagonal structure\" to be downed in Michigan near the Canadian border - the fourth object to be taken out in eight days.. Fighter pilots also shot down smaller unidentified objects over Alaska on 10 February and northern Canada on 11 February.. Mr Wang said he had \"no understanding of [these other objects]\".. \"But what we want to tell everyone here is that the US' frequent firing of advanced missiles used to strike down unidentified flying objects is an overreaction of excessive force,\" he said.. A US military commander, General Glen VanHerck, said that there was no indication of any threat from the latest object. . He said it could be a \"gaseous type of balloon\" or \"some type of a propulsion system\" - adding he could not rule out that the objects were extra-terrestrials.. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the country safe from the threat of spy balloons.. \"We have something called the quick reaction alert force which involves Typhoon planes, which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,\" he added..

        "content": "She suffered minor injuries and later gave birth to a boy, Adnan, at a hospital in Afrin supported by the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams).. They returned to the house, only for it to collapse fully three days later.. Adnan was brought back to Afrin's al-Shifa Hospital by rescuers in a critical condition, suffering from severe dehydration and jaundice, while Dima was treated for a serious lower limb injury.. Dr Abdulkarim Hussein al-Ibrahim, a paediatrician, told the BBC via WhatsApp on Monday that the baby was responding well to treatment.. \"Adnan's condition... has significantly improved,\" he said. \"We are just feeding him and [providing] the rest of his needs through intravenous drips.\". Video footage released by Sams showed Adnan sleeping peacefully inside an incubator with his wrist hooked up to a drip.. Dima has been discharged from hospital once again and is living in a tent along with her husband, Abdul Majid, and their nine other children. She has been travelling to Afrin to visit Adnan in hospital every day. . Her family was forced to return to her partially destroyed home after she gave birth because there was no alternative shelter available in Jindayris, one of the worst-hit towns in opposition-held north-western Syria.. They have also not received any other aid since the earthquake, like thousands of others who have been affected.. Even before the disaster, 4.1 million people - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive in the region, which is the last bastion of the jihadists and rebels who have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad for 12 years. . But as of Sunday, only 52 lorries carrying aid from UN agencies had arrived from Turkey via Bab al-Hawa in Idlib province - the sole border crossing that the UN is authorised to use to deliver humanitarian assistance. . The deliveries had been scheduled before the earthquake and were delayed by damaged roads and other logistical issues, which meant they have not included the heavy machinery and other specialist equipment needed by the White Helmets, whose first responders operate in opposition-held areas. . Dr Ibrahim said there was an acute shortage of the medicines, other medical supplies, beds and blankets needed to treat the many injured people still being pulled from the rubble.. \"No hospital has the capacity to accommodate this large number of injuries,\" he warned. \"[Everywhere] is full.\" . The chairman of the Sams Foundation, Dr Basel Termanini, said the lack of shelter and access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services was also a major concern for the medical relief organisation, whose facilities in the region have helped more than 2,000 earthquake victims.. \"We can treat the women after trauma or after delivery, but they need to go back to a safe environment with minimum housing, nutrition and clean water,\" he told the BBC.. \"Unfortunately, this is in general lacking in north-western Syria, due to limited resources and the markedly delayed aid coming from the only lifeline of Bab al-Hawa crossing.\". Dr Termanini accused the UN and the international community of being \"quite guilty of poor planning and failed execution\". . Sams was currently working with the White Helmets and the Syrian Forum, a consortium of non-profit organisations assisting people in the region, to \"fill in the gaps\" in shelter and nutrition, he added.. \"But the needs are massive and the international community need to get their act together to avoid a major humanitarian crisis.\". More than 35,000 people are known to have been killed in Syria and Turkey since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey..  - more than 800 higher than the combined death tolls published over the weekend by the Syrian government and the White Helmets. . During a visit to the government-held city of Aleppo on Monday, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told reporters that the initial \"rescue phase\" following the disaster was \"drawing to a close\".. \"The humanitarian phase - the urgency of providing shelter, psychosocial care, food, schooling and a sense of the future for these people - that's our obligation now,\" he said.. Mr Griffiths also said the UN hoped to deliver aid to opposition-held areas across the front lines from the government's territory, something which has rarely happened during the country's 12-year civil war.. The UN has said the dominant jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has held up \"cross-line\" deliveries since the earthquake. But HTS has rejected the allegation and accused the UN of \"politicising the emergency response\".. ",

Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain.. Last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. . Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer. The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. . Moldova - formerly part of the Soviet Union - depends on Russia for natural gas. It has suffered power cuts in the past year, coinciding with Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.. President Sandu alleged Russia was planning to use \"saboteurs with military background, camouflaged in civilian clothes, to undertake violent actions, attacks on state institutions and taking hostages\".. The plot would involve citizens of Russia, Montenegro, Belarus and Serbia entering Moldova, she told a news conference.. She urged Moldova's parliament to adopt laws to give the country's Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) and prosecutors \"the necessary means to fight more efficiently against national security threats\".
