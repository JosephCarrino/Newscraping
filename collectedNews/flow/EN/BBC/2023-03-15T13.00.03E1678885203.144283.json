        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. On Tuesday, officers in riot gear fired tear gas shells and water cannon to disperse hundreds of angry supporters of Mr Khan at the compound. Some of the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. He has said he did not appear because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . Mr Khan earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Argentina has been in economic difficulty for years, and most of the population now live in poverty.. Its government has being trying to stem price rises by capping the prices of food and other products. . But the food and drink sectors saw the most dramatic increase recent, with prices growing by 9.8% in February compared to January.. Argentinian media said that this increase could partly be due to a sharp hike in the price of meat, which rose by almost 20% in the space of a month. Adverse weather conditions, a prolonged heatwave and a drought seriously impacted livestock and crops, said local news outlet Ambito.. Although the symbolism of the inflation rate shooting up past 100% is striking, the effects of soaring inflation have long been felt in Argentina. . Last September, protesters took to the streets to demand action to counter rising costs of living, and, in February, Argentina's central bank said that.  in response to the jump in consumer prices.. The Argentinian government has long tried to contain inflation, but divisions have marred the country's economic policy. . Last summer, three economy ministers succeeded one another in the space of four weeks as the country's economic crisis deepened, and President Alberto Fernández is said to be at odds with his deputy, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, over how to tackle Argentina's economic problems. . In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. ",

        "content": "The damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.. The key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . US military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. He said the jets were able to land following the incident.. This video can not be played. Watch: Pentagon calls Russia's move 'unsafe, unprofessional'. Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. . Brig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.. The United States' National Security Council's John Kirby told CNN: \"Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we've taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\". Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\" and that it was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.. Prof Michael Clarke, visiting professor in war studies at King's College, told the BBC the collision was \"almost certainly an accident\".. The ex-director general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute said: \"I don't believe any pilot could deliberately do that [only colliding with another aircraft's propeller] without seriously endangering their aircraft and own life.\". The incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.. To protest against the move, the US summoned Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov in Washington.. Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Mr Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\" and that \"the unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern\". . On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But, he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . This means the downing of the drone could conceivably have been the result of a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. . But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then analysts say that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "The United States' National Security Council's (NSC) John Kirby says there have been other intercepts \"even in recent weeks\", but that this one was different.. Could it have been an accident? . \"Based on the actions of the Russian pilots, it's clear that it was unsafe, unprofessional,\" was the verdict of the Pentagon's Press Secretary, Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. . \"I think the actions speak for themselves.\". Does the behaviour of Russia's pilots - allegedly dumping fuel in the path of the drone and then colliding with it - represent a significant escalation? . This video can not be played. Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?. According to the Pentagon, the whole incident lasted about 30-40 minutes.. During that time, Gen Ryder said there was no direct communication between the Russian and American militaries. . US officials say they believe the Russian Su-27 jets involved \"likely\" suffered some damage, indicating that a collision was not deliberate.. \"I do know that the state department is raising our concerns about the incident directly with the Russian government,\" he added.. What, if anything, does the episode mean for the future of American drone operations over the Black Sea, and for the vital surveillance such operations provide to Ukraine? . \"If the message is that they want to deter or dissuade us from flying or operating in international airspace over the Black Sea,\" Mr Kirby told broadcaster VOA, \"then that message will fail because that is not going to happen\".. Not surprisingly, Russia would like to make it as hard as possible for Ukraine's allies to carry out such work. . Washington is being tight lipped about what has happened to the drone. . After the collision, US remote pilots were forced to bring it down in the Black Sea.. Gen Ryder would not say where it landed or whether the Russian navy was trying to recover it. . Audio recordings circulating on social media seem to indicate some kind of Russian recovery operation was under way. But this has not been confirmed. . Clearly, Washington would not be happy if such sensitive surveillance technology fell into Russian hands.. For Joe Biden, determined to support Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\", this is a delicate moment.. It's not just Western weaponry that's helping Ukraine to withstand Russia's invasion. . It's also a vast quantity of real-time intelligence on every aspect of Russia's military operations, including the movement of vessels in the Black Sea and the launch of missiles aimed at targets across Ukraine. . From defending Ukraine's critical national infrastructure to planning its own offensive operations, Kyiv depends heavily on the steady flow of information. . For obvious reasons, US officials won't be drawn into what, if any, additional precautions its surveillance operations will now involve.. Washington wants to keep them going, but is anxious to avoid using force, and risk getting drawn into a more direct confrontation with Moscow. . ",
