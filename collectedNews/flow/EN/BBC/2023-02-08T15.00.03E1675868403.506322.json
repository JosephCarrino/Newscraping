The packages were strung up with buoys and some labelled with a Batman symbol.. Pictures released by New Zealand police and defence officials also showed cocaine packets labelled with a black four-leaf clover symbol.. These were the \"trademark logos\" for the drug producers, believed to be in South America, said New Zealand officials.. \"This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealand agencies, by some margin,\" said New Zealand's police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday.. \"It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,\" he added.. New Zealand's navy deployed a vessel to retrieve the massive shipment last week, which comprised 81 bales of cocaine.. They were brought to Auckland in New Zealand's North Island on Tuesday and taken to a security facility to be documented and destroyed, officials said. . \"We believe we have dealt a significant blow to an international criminal syndicate's operation,\" Mr Coster said.. Authorities did not disclose details of the operation or how they found the drugs. But they said their partners in the Five Eyes intelligence group - which includes Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US - had provided assistance.. ",

        "content": "Like others, he believes that he is more likely to find his missing brother if he sifts through the rubble himself.. Ismail, a 26-year-old supermarket cashier, had been staying with relatives in Hatay province on the Syrian border at the time of the earthquake.  . Others, including his brother-in-law, were pulled from the remains of the building later that day, but Ismail has not been found, Samet said.. \"I'm missing him so much. I have come from Bahrain to Turkey to search for him. He's my one and only brother,\" he told the BBC.. Samet described Ismail as intelligent and \"shy with girls\". He said he was desperate for good news, but felt there was \"no help\" with the search.. After arriving in Turkey, Samet waited for hours in Istanbul for a flight to take him to Adana in the south of the country, before beginning the hours-long drive to Hatay province.. \"It's so cold here. Life is difficult,\" he said by WhatsApp message late on Tuesday night after arriving in the province, which has been devastated by the earthquake.. With nowhere to stay, he warmed himself by a fire through the night, as he waited for daylight so he could begin the search for Ismail.. Samet is not alone. The BBC has spoken to people from across Turkey and abroad who have been travelling down to areas hit by the earthquake to search for missing loved ones. . In the city of Antakya, men armed with pickaxes and crowbars sifted through the rubble of a fallen building on Tuesday, looking for survivors. They told the BBC they were family members of the building's residents and had come from Istanbul to search for their relatives. . Medical student Aylin Pulat could not get hold of several members of her family, including her parents, after the earthquake struck.. She is based in Mugla, more than 1,000km (620 miles) from her family home in Adiyaman.. With no news on her family's fate, she took a four-hour bus trip, a two-hour flight and a more than two-hour drive back to her home city to find out if they were alive.. To her great relief, she arrived to find that her siblings and parents had survived. But 20 other relatives had died.. \"When I arrived, I saw so much of the city was destroyed and there was no safe place for people to get shelter,\" she said.. \"The only relief I got was to see that almost all of my [immediate] family were safe. I wasn't sure before getting there.. \"When I found them, they were all dressed in pyjamas and that's how I knew they had escaped with nothing. We all just froze.\". She said she could hear noises from some fallen buildings, but that rescue efforts were being left largely to residents of the city.. \"People are just waiting helplessly to reach their loved ones under the rubble. We need support here as soon as possible.\". This video can not be played. Turkey earthquake: Drone flies over Hatay revealing extent of destruction. ",

There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down.. In November, a Dutch court found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17.. The prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings.. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries.. In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team said the court ruled that Moscow had \"overall control\" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014. . It cited recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said that the decision to provide military support \"rests with the President\".. \"There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,\" it said. . But it adds that is not known whether the request \"explicitly mentions\" the system used to shoot down MH17.. \"Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,\" investigators said.. \"Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State.\". This video can not be played. The Dutch Safety Board released an animated video showing the flight path of the plane. The Joint Investigation Team is made up of members from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - the countries worst affected by the shooting down of MH17.. The team wanted to prove the identities of the missile's crew members, and who was in the chain of command, but admitted that was not possible for now.. Russia denies all involvement and dismissed last year's Dutch verdict as \"scandalous\" and politically motivated. . Piet Ploeg lost his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew on MH17. He said he was glad prosecutors had laid out their evidence for Mr Putin's involvement.. \"We can't do a lot with it, Putin can't be prosecuted,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to know who was ultimately responsible and that's clear.\".
