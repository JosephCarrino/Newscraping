        "content": "The BBC said that it was \"fully co-operating\" with authorities.. \"We hope to have this situation resolved as soon as possible,\" a short statement added.. Although the documentary was broadcast on television only in the UK, India's government has attempted to block people sharing . online, calling it \"hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage\" with a \"colonial mind-set\". . Last month, police in Delhi detained students as they . The documentary focused on the prime minister's role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state. . The general secretary of the opposition Congress party, KC Venugopal, said Tuesday's search \"reeks of desperation and shows that the Modi government is scared of criticism\". . \"We condemn these intimidation tactics in the harshest terms. This undemocratic and dictatorial attitude cannot go on any longer,\" he tweeted.. But Gaurav Bhatia, a spokesman from Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), described the BBC as the \"most corrupt organisation in the world\". . \"India is a country which gives an opportunity to every organisation,\" he said, \"as long as you don't spew venom.\". He added the searches were lawful and the timing had nothing to do with the government.. The Editors Guild of India - a non-profit group which promotes press freedom - said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the searches. . They are a \"continuation of a trend of using government agencies to intimidate and harass press organisations that are critical of government policies or the ruling establishment\", it said.. Amnesty International India's Board accused authoritiesÂ of \"trying to harass and intimidate the BBC over its critical coverage of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\".. It said the \"overbroad powers of the Income Tax Department are repeatedly being weaponised to silence dissent\".. The documentary highlights a previously unpublished report, obtained by the BBC from the UK Foreign Office, which raises questions about Mr Modi's actions during . The rioting began the day after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire, killing dozens. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in the subsequent violence.. The Foreign Office report claims that Mr Modi was \"directly responsible\" for the \"climate of impunity\" that enabled the violence. . In 2005, the US denied Mr Modi a visa under a law that bars the entry of foreign officials seen to be responsible for \"severe violations of religious freedom\".. Mr Modi has long rejected accusations against him, and has not apologised for the riots. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel also said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.. The BBC said last month that the Indian government was offered a right to reply to the documentary but it declined.. The broadcaster said the film was \"rigorously researched\" and \"a wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions, including responses from people in the BJP\".. This video can not be played. From January: Students arrested before screening of BBC Modi documentary . The targeting of organisations seen as critical of the government is not uncommon in India. . In 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt its India operations, with the group accusing the government of pursuing a \"witch-hunt\" against human rights organisations.. Oxfam was also searched last year along with other local non-government organisations.. The Editors Guild of India said tax authorities raided four other media outlets in 2021, after they carried negative coverage of the government. . According to the non-profit group Reporters Without Borders press freedom has fallen since Mr Modi came to power. . The group's .  countries, down 10 places since 2014. . ",

        "content": "In the video sent to the BBC's Indonesian service, Mr Mehrtens was surrounded by seven West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) fighters. . They pledged to release the pilot if Papua was granted independence.. Previously a Dutch colony, Papua declared independence in 1961, but Indonesia took control two years later. The resource-rich region has been caught in a battle for independence ever since it was brought under Jakarta's formal control in a UN-supervised vote in 1969.. The fighters appearing in the videos were armed with a mixture of assault rifles and bows and arrows. One man - who addressed the camera and outlined the group's demands - introduced himself as TPNPB leader Egianus Kogoya. . The BBC cannot independently verify the man's identity. . Mr Mehrtens - who appeared in the video wearing a blue denim jacket, a matching hat and long khaki pants - seemingly read a prepared statement in which he repeated the rebels' demands. . The 37-year-old was kidnapped after his small passenger plane, which belongs to Indonesia's Susi Air, landed in Nduga. . His plane had departed from the Mozes Kilangin airport in Central Papua early on Tuesday, and was meant to return a few hours later after dropping off five passengers.. But shortly after landing rebels stormed the single-engine plane and seized the Christchurch native. A TPNPB spokesman later told BBC Indonesian that Mr Mehrtens had been moved to a stronghold district for the group in a remote area, and he would be used as \"leverage\" in political negotiations.. The group says that the pilot is being held because New Zealand co-operates militarily with Indonesia. . The other passengers, who were indigenous Papuans, were released. . Papuan rebels seeking independence from Indonesia have previously issued threats and even attacked aircraft they believe to be carrying personnel and supplies for Jakarta.. Conflicts between indigenous Papuans and the Indonesian authorities are common, with pro-independence fighters mounting more frequent attacks since 2018.. The region is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua. It is separate from Papua New Guinea, which was given independence by Australia in 1975.. ",

She said in 2021 she wouldn't challenge him for the White House, but changed her mind in recent months, citing the need for \"generational change\".. Other Republicans expected to launch campaign to be selected for their party include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence.. She has previously criticised Mr Trump's behaviour up to and during the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters. . The day after the riot, she said in a speech that \"his actions since election day will be judged harshly by history\".. Most early polls show Mr Trump with a comfortable lead in South Carolina, whose primary he won on his way to the presidency in 2016 - an indication of the uphill battle the former ambassador will have, even on what should be friendly ground.. A recent survey by the polling firm Trafalgar Group that included current and likely candidates has Mr Trump in first place with 43% and Ms Haley in fourth at 12%.. Other Indian Americans to run before her were Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, whose bid in 2015 never gained significant traction, and current Vice-President Kamala Harris, who sought the 2020 nomination..

        "content": "Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October's explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea.. \"I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,\" Olesya tells the BBC, \"reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened.\" . She had also shared a friend's post about the war.. Then the drama began.. \"I was talking on the phone to my mother,\" Olesya recalls, \"when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor.\". Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison.. \"I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,\" Olesya says. \"I'd seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn't paid much attention and continued to speak out.\". A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia's official list of terrorists and extremists. . \"When I realised I'd been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,\" recalls Olesya. . Under the rules of her house arrest she's banned from talking on the phone and going online.. Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: \"Big Brother is watching you.\". It appears that in Olesya's case, it wasn't Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students.. \"A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,\" Olesya says, \"about how I was against the 'special military operation'. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities.\". The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat.. In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing \"provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud\". . \"First let's try to discredit her. If she doesn't get it, let the security services deal with it.\". \"Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,\" someone else writes.. Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat.. It's one year since the Kremlin launched its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate \"true patriots from scum and traitors\".. Since then, across Russia .  against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues. . Public criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people's criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don't support it, at the very least you're expected to stay silent. If you don't stay silent, there's a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading \"false information\" about the military and \"discrediting\" the army.. In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: \"Being a warrior means living forever.\" . The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments. . \"People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they're sick in the head,\" Konstantin tells me. \"They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder.\" . \"I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,\" Ekaterina tells me. . But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn't that harsh? I ask.. \"People should use their brains,\" Ekaterina replies. \"If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they're patriots, they need to abide by the law.\". Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement. . Olesya's T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with \"School Bus\" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities.. The judge rules to keep her under house arrest.. \"The state doesn't have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,\" Olesya says. \"But they can't put everyone in prison. At some point they'll run out of cells.\". ",

        "content": "She and her family asked the BBC not to reveal her precise location; their worry is that there may be repercussions even thousands of miles away from Iran.. Women in Iran are required to wear headscarves in public, even when abroad. But a few are choosing not to, in support of the women and girls spearheading the protests inside the country, following the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September. One of them, the climber Elnaz Rekabi, was forced to recant and it is unclear what her situation is, now that she is back in Iran.. Sara Khadem said there was a slow evolution of her decision to play in the tournament in Kazakhstan in December last year without her headscarf. The contestants only wore them in front of the cameras, and she felt that was hypocritical. Given the sacrifices being made by the women and girls on the streets of Iran, some of them risking their lives, it was the least she could do, she said. . Had she considered joining the demonstrators herself? \"Yes of course,\" she replied. But her young son, Sam, held her back. She said: \"I have responsibilities to him, and I thought perhaps I could use my influence in other ways.\" . Sara Khadem has been playing chess competitively since she was about eight years old. This is not the first time she has fallen foul of the Islamic Republic's strict codes of behaviour.. In 2020, a Ukrainian plane which took off from Tehran airport was shot down by, as it turned out, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, killing 176 people. It was three days before the authorities admitted their error. Ms Khadem said on social media she was planning to leave the national team. She did not mention the flight - nevertheless, she was forced to sign a confession saying she did not mean anything political by her post.. The next time she went to the airport, her passport was confiscated. She thought her career was over.. Now that her life has changed utterly, does she have any regrets? Without hesitation she said no. \"I miss my family, but I would not say I regret the decision. I still represent Iran, and I am Iranian, and the people of Iran still see me as Iranian.\". It struck me that she does not regard herself as political, though she acknowledges that so much in Iran is political. She said, \"I'm not an activist, and I don't have any messages for people risking so much. The people who are protesting in the streets are inspiring to me and so many others.\". Her husband, Ardeshir Ahmadi, is a film director and internet show presenter, who has also had direct experience of being on the wrong side of the Islamic Republic. A documentary film about hip hop resulted in him being beaten and imprisoned for three months. The decision which led to their exile was a joint one. . She has been able to stay in Spain because of the golden visa rule, which allows anyone who buys a property valued at half a million euros (Â£442,000; $536,000) to gain residency. . Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez invited Sara Khadem to meet him. The day turned out to be bittersweet. . \"It was on that day that I was issued with arrest orders at home. So I had mixed feelings: I was appreciated in this country - and in my own country, where you have achieved lots of success, you get arrest papers.\" . ",

Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\", said US Northern Command.. The FBI is examining the items, which the US said were used to spy on sensitive military sites. . The US has shot down three more objects since the first on 4 February.. \"Large sections of the structure\" were also recovered on Monday off the coast of South Carolina, military officials said.. About 30-40ft (9-12m) of the balloon's antennas were among the items found, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.. US officials said the high-altitude balloon originated in China and was used for surveillance, but China said it was a weather-monitoring airship that had blown astray. . Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border.. But officials have not said these objects were suspected spy balloons.. In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-16 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources. . The second missile hit the target. Each Sidewinder missile costs more than $400,000 (Â£330,000).. Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the first balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target. . White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down \"out of an abundance of caution\".. They did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\", he said.. The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses.Â . The second object, over Alaska, was described as the size of a \"small car\". The third object, over the Yukon, was \"cylindrical\". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be \"octagonal\" with strings attached.Â . A Pentagon memo later reported in US media said the flying object shot down over Yukon appeared to be a \"small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it\". . This video can not be played. Watch: 'Whatâs going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. The recovery of the balloon shot down on 4 February was delayed due to bad weather.. Efforts are under way to collect debris from where the other objects were blown out of the sky.. Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul PrÃ©vost said all three of the most recent objects to be shot down appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday. . Amid the row over high-altitude aircraft, America's top diplomat cancelled a visit to Beijing that was initially planned for last week.. Meanwhile, in a sign of heightened tensions over the incidents in the US, Romania scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday to investigate an aerial object entering European airspace..
