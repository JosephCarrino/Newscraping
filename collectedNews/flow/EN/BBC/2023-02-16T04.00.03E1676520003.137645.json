        "content": "WATCH: The BBC was given special access to the Icefin expedition. The British Antarctic Survey and the US Antarctic programme put sensors and an underwater robot beneath the vast Thwaites glacier to study melting.. The size of Britain, Thwaites is one of the world's fastest changing glaciers.. Its susceptibility to climate change is a major concern to scientists because if it melted completely, it would raise global sea levels by half a metre.. The new research suggests that even low amounts of melting can potentially push a glacier further along the path toward eventual disappearance.. The joint survey at Thwaites is part of one of the largest investigations ever undertaken anywhere on the White Continent.. Since the late 1990s, the glacier has seen a 14km retreat of its \"grounding line\" - that's the point where the ice flowing off the land and along the seabed floats up to form a huge platform. . In some places that grounding line is retreating now by over a kilometre a year, and because of the landward-sloping shape of the seabed, this process will likely accelerate.. During the new research, British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists dropped sensors through boreholes in the ice to the water below. . While warmer water circulates under the shelf, they found less melting than expected under those higher temperatures; a layer of fresh water was insulating against further losses.. But, worryingly, they also discovered with the help of computer modelling that the volume of melting was not the most critical factor in a glacier's retreat.. \"It's good that the melt rate is low but what matters is how the melt rate changes,\" explained BAS oceanographer Dr Pete Davis. \"To push an ice shelf out of equilibrium, we need to increase the melt rate. So even if the melt rate increases just a small amount, it can still drive rapid retreat.\". The observations showing less melting than expected were taken from parts of the underside of the glacier that were flat and relatively uniform.. But images the underwater robot .  gathered for the US Antarctic programme as part of the same joint survey showed that things were often far more complex.. \"What we could see is that instead of this kind of flat ice that we had all pictured, there were all kinds of staircases and cracks in the ice that weren't really expected,\" said Cornell University-based researcher Britney Schmidt, who guided Icefin under Thwaites using a video monitor and a games console controller. . To get the torpedo-shaped Icefin under Thwaites, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) opened a narrow hole through 600m of ice with a hot-water drill. The tethered sub was then winched down to begin its exploration. . Dr Schmidt's team conducted five separate dives, taking the robot right up to the glacier's grounding line.. Icefin's onboard sensors indicated that it is in these particular locations that the bottom of Thwaites is being eroded by the influx of warm water coming from the wider ocean.. \"Basically, the warm water is getting into the weak spots and making them even weaker,\" said Dr Schmidt. \"What this allows us to do now is to put this kind of information into our predictive models to understand how the ice shelf is going to break down, and when.\". The lessons learned at Thwaites almost certainly apply to all the other glaciers in the region that are also in retreat, Dr Davis added.. Two scholarly papers describing the work are published this week in the scientific journal Nature. . , the other on . .. One of the contributing authors on the Icefin paper is . , the former director of science at BAS, whose death was announced by the polar agency last week. . Over 35-plus years, Prof Vaughan had built a formidable reputation as one of the world's leading glaciologists.. He championed the UK-US Thwaites project and was its co-lead until stepping back because of illness.. His journey to see the research described in Wednesday's two papers was his final expedition south.. Prof Helen Fricker, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, is in Antarctica currently. She said: \"David was a brilliant, thoughtful and engaging scientist who was a role model for so many. He was a leader in the field, making important geophysical insights about the Antarctic ice sheet and how it is changing. . \"He led with dignity, grace, humour and compassion, and was actively supportive of young scientists, especially minorities. Antarctic science has lost a true hero and he will be deeply missed.\". ",

        "content": "Watch: Family of victim charges Buffalo shooter in court room. Payton Gendron, 19, pleaded guilty to 25 counts, including first-degree murder and terrorism motivated by hate.. Ahead of the sentencing on Wednesday, a family member rushed towards the killer and was restrained by security. . Other relatives shared emotional impact statements.. Barbara Massey, whose sister Katherine was killed, said to the gunman: \"You are going to come to our city and decide you don't like black people. Man, you don't know a damn thing about black people. We're human.\". Ms Massey's statement was interrupted by her own son lunging toward the gunman. She told reporters outside court \"he saw me emotional and I'm his mom\".. \"We're close,\" she said. \"You hurt one of us, you hurt us all.\". Zaire Goodman, who was injured, suffers from survivor's guilt, his mother told the courtroom. . \"He is dealing with the pain that I as a mother cannot bear,\" Zeneta Everhart said.. \"On that day this terrorist made the choice that the value of a black human meant nothing to him… whatever the sentence is that [the gunman] receives, it will never be enough.\". Brian Talley lost family member Geraldine Talley in the shooting. . He said: \"I forgive you, but I forgive you not for your sake, but for mine and for this black community.\". All of the 10 people killed were black. Three others were wounded.. Wayne Jones, the son of a victim, Celestine Chaney, addressed the killer: \"You've been brainwashed. You don't even know black people that much to hate them. You learned this on the internet.. \"I hope you find it in your heart to apologise to these people, man. You did wrong for no reason.\". The killer wept as Tamika Harper shared memories of her murdered aunt, Geraldine Talley.. Ms Harper told him: \"Do I hate you? No. Do I want you to die? No. I want you to stay alive. I want you to think about this every day of your life.\". Investigators said the gunman researched the racial makeup of Buffalo, which was 200 miles (320km) away from his house in Conklin, New York, before his attack.. Wearing bullet-resistant armour, he live-streamed the 14 May attack at Tops Friendly Market after writing online how he had been inspired by other racially motivated shootings. . But speaking to the court on Wednesday he warned against copycat shootings.. The gunman, who is not eligible for parole, said: \"I shot and killed people because they were black. Looking back now, I can't believe I actually did it. . \"I believed what I read online and acted out of hate. I know I can't take it back, but I wish I could, and I don't want anyone to be inspired by me and what I did.\". As she delivered her decision, Judge Susan Eagan said: \"There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances.\". New York state no longer allows the death penalty, but prosecutors at the federal level may seek it over hate and domestic terror charges to which the gunman has pleaded not guilty.. ",

        "content": "He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year.. He was captain of the Thai boys' football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. . His grinning face, caught by the torch light of a diver after the boys were found in the cave, was one of the most memorable images from the rescue. . It is not known how the teenager died, but Leicestershire Police said his death is not being treated as suspicious. Reports in Thailand said he suffered a head injury.. Promthep was driven by ambulance to Kettering General Hospital on Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson for East Midlands Ambulance Service said. An air ambulance was also sent to the scene.. In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Promthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Market Harborough. . \"Today my dream has come true,\" he wrote. . Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. . News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. . \"May Dom's soul rest in peace,\" said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks.. Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. . \"You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it,\" wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Promthep in 2018.. \"When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. . \"Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together.\" . Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: \"Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream... if the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom.\". Principal of Brooke House College, Ian Smith, said they were \"deeply saddened and shaken\" by the death.. \"We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college's global family,\" he said.. In a . , British Ambassador to Thailand Mark Gooding passed on \"his condolences to all his friends and family.\". Promthep studied in Vachiralai Bee School in Chiang Mai before he went to the UK. A diehard football fan, he had been a member of a youth team in Chiang Mai.. His Instagram account is filled with posts on the sport, often accompanied with the hashtag #footballismylife. . One of his last posts in January shows a sketch of his \"dream team's football kit\" - jersey, shorts, socks and shoes with blue and pink stripes. . After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Promthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave on their bicycles. It was one of the team's favourite haunts.. But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave system to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. . They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. . Promthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25.. The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. . Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue. They were eventually brought out after being sedated with the drug ketamine.. The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year..

        "content": "The other 28 defendants were also acquitted - among them Moroccan dancer Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, who figured in an earlier Berlusconi case.. Berlusconi has faced many court cases.. In the Ruby case, the right-wing senator won an appeal against his conviction for paying for sex with an underage prostitute. Ruby and he both denied having had sex and she denied having ever been a prostitute.. In his various court cases, he has denied wrongdoing, accusing prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him. He insisted the parties - described by some as \"orgies\" - were actually elegant dinners.. The only Berlusconi trial that ended in a conviction was his sentencing for tax fraud in 2013. Given his age, Italian justice treated him leniently - he did a year of community service at a care home near Milan.. Berlusconi was prime minister three times between 1994 and 2011. He was accused of giving witnesses millions of euros in hush money in the \"bunga-bunga\" trial, but said the money was given as compensation for reputational damage to people linked to the notorious parties.. He was temporarily barred from political office over his conviction for tax fraud, but won a seat in the Senate in 2022 elections.. His Forza Italia party plays a key role in Italy's ruling right-wing coalition, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. She hailed his acquittal as \"excellent news that puts an end to a long legal case that also had important repercussions on Italian political and institutional life\".. As Italian leader, Berlusconi forged a close friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And this week, Berlusconi made controversial comments about the war in Ukraine which were condemned by Kyiv.. On Sunday, Berlusconi said he would \"never\" have met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, as Ms Meloni did last Thursday in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU summit.. Berlusconi said that if President Zelensky had stopped attacking the two Russian-backed regions of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, the war would not have happened. \"So I judge very, very negatively the behaviour of this gentleman,\" he said.. Ms Meloni reaffirmed Italian support for Mr Zelensky after Berlusconi's remarks. And Zelensky aide Mykhailo Podolyak denounced Berlusconi as \"a VIP agitator who is acting in the interests of Russian propaganda\". \"He is bartering away Italy's reputation for his friendship with Putin,\" he said..
