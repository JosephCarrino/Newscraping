        "content": "It follows four attacks across Afghanistan on Thursday - all claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). . The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a key security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.. No-one has admitted carrying out Friday's attack in Kunduz, which came as worshippers gathered to pray. . A local shopkeeper told AFP news agency: \"The sight at the mosque was horrifying.\". The explosion was similar to Thursday's bomb which tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 31 people  and wounding 87. . Thursday's attack in Kunduz killed four people and wounded 18. . Admitting those attacks, IS said it was part of an ongoing global campaign to \"avenge\" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman.. Bomb attacks in Afghanistan have declined considerably since the Taliban came to power last August following the withdrawal of US and other Western forces after 20 years in the country.. IS does not control any territory in Afghanistan, but since their rivals, the Taliban, took power, they have been carrying out attacks in areas where they previously never had a presence, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Pakistan.. Sufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in the region for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.. IS militants also target the Taliban, with whom they have a fierce rivalry.. Responding to the attacks, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described the perpetrators as \"evil elements\", adding \"serious efforts are being made to arrest and punish them\".. The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Ramiz Alakbarov said the attacks this week were \"a painful reminder of the insecurity and dangers facing the Afghan people daily\". . \"The indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, which has already caused more than 100 civilian casualties this week, is unacceptable and must cease immediately,\" Mr Alakbarov said in a statement on Friday. .

        "content": "And so Oleksandr took a photo of the wound with his smartphone and sent it to Prof Nott, who had recently flown back to the UK. The experienced British war surgeon confirmed the operation was necessary. He'd also previously given Oleksandr a video talking him through how it was done.. \"I was quite nervous and it was slowly, step-by-step surgery, but it went well thanks to David Nott,\" Oleksandr says.. Prof Nott, who was born in Carmarthen in west Wales, has previously worked in conflict zones including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.. Fortunately for Oleksandr and his patient, the consultant surgeon at St Mary's Hospital in London had made Ukraine the latest destination in his mission to train doctors how to treat war wounds. . Russia's tactics of bombarding and shelling cities means Ukraine's hospitals are currently seeing many blast injuries.. \"It is the worst possible way of attacking the opposition, by simply shelling,\" says Prof Nott, in his first interview since returning from Ukraine. \"It causes enormous damage. It causes dreadful, dreadful injuries.\" These include shrapnel wounds to soft tissue, bones and limbs.. Even just the shockwave of such a blast can do huge damage, he says. The \"blast wind\" in its wake is capable of amputating limbs. Being thrown against buildings can cause traumatic injuries, too.. Barotrauma - physical injury caused by changes in pressure during an explosion - is a particular concern because of Russia's use of . , also known as vacuum bombs. These can cause bleeds on the brain and in the lungs, causing victims to cough up blood. They are also capable of bursting ear drums and perforating bowels.. While he says he has been all over Ukraine - \"north, east, south-east, west\" - Prof Nott does not want to talk about the specific hospitals or areas he has visited for fear that Russian forces will target them - and for the same reason, the BBC is not using Oleksandr's full name or location.. During the war in Syria, he used a Skype connection from his office in London to assist with .  - only for the hospital to be bombed a few days later. He has spoken about how he will never know if the two were connected.. Now Prof Nott says 115 hospitals in Ukraine have already been shelled by Russia.. \"Blowing up hospitals and killing doctors is a real weapon of war too, it's just despicable,\" he says.. While he was in Ukraine, Prof Nott brought as many doctors as possible into operating theatres to watch him carry out operations on warzone injuries, including filling holes in limbs, grafting skin and covering exposed bones.. But the mission, a combined venture between his own David Nott Foundation and the humanitarian group UOSSM International, did not end when he left the country as he would soon end up advising Oleksandr remotely before the complicated leg operation.. This involved taking a flap of skin from behind the patient's knee to close a wound and prevent infection getting into the exposed bone.. \"They are very difficult operations, they are not easy and they go wrong and cause problems,\" Prof Nott says. . But despite these challenges, the result was \"miraculous\", he says. \"It worked really well.\". For Oleksandr's part, he says it was important to have the advice of someone with practical experience of the operation: \"It's a relief to us when he tells us it will be OK.\". He is full of praise for Prof Nott, who he says has \"showed us ordinary doctors how to fight on the medical frontline\".. Oleksandr says knowing how to carry out these types of procedure is \"very necessary in our situation\" because there are so many shelling injuries and open fractures that need to be treated.. Prof Nott, through his charity the David Nott Foundation, has translated a series of slides and videos on how to treat war wounds into Ukrainian \"which went on as many of the doctors' phones as it possibly could\".. He also hopes those like Oleksandr that he has taught will pass on what they have learned. \"He will train other people how to do it, they'll train other people to do it and then hopefully everyone will know how to do it in the not-too-distant future,\" Prof Nott says.. Unfortunately, it seems the demand for these skills in Ukraine will not go away any time soon.. Earlier this month, Ukraine's foreign minister said the battles in the eastern Donbas region would resemble World War Two, with the use of \"thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery\".. To Prof Nott, the scenes coming out of cities like Mariupol are reminiscent of what he previously witnessed in Aleppo.. \"It's exactly the same as Syria, exactly the same tactics,\" he says.. \"Aleppo, when I was there by 2016, was completely flattened, the whole place was completely and utterly destroyed.\". Oleksandr says he is now treating \"awful injuries\" that he had hoped never to see.. \"We would like to treat normal trauma, like grannies and grandpas who need joint replacements, common fractures,\" he says.. But he adds: \"We are doing our job day by day and whatever happens we will stay at home and do what we should do.\". What did Putin do before he came to power?.

Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak.. The .  features audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading.. \"This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,\" another man says.. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat.. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites.. It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown.. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures include .  to prevent those with the virus from leaving and . .. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that \"even the ceiling isn't finished yet\" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into.. \"Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,\" she said.. Other residents shout out \"thank you, big whites!\" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules.. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators.. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: \"The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!\" . \"Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,\" another commentator wrote.. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city.. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free.. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged..

        "content": "In order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round.. But these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor.. Mr Macron's detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.. Mr Macron rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living.. Marine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last.  . The great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout could be historically low.. The campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration. . Polls open at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) with voting set to end some 12 hours later. . Whatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.. The rising cost of living - described in France as .  or spending power - has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins.. She has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era.. She came top two weeks ago in La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, Cécile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: \"Before Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm.\". She will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: \"People can't afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I'm in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat.\" African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds.. There are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that. . She has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a \"Europe of nations\" would tear the EU apart.  . Jean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and take drugs.. This video can not be played. Across France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La Ferté too.. Apprentice accountant Séréna, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: \"We don't really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now.\". Nicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. \"I'm not so worried about her, more about the people behind her - her lieutenants.\". Ms Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.. He was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes. . The town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a Mélenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply.. Outside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right's policies as racist. \"I'm going to vote blank,\" she says. It's a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all.. Many Mélenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. \"Macron is more for the rich than the poor,\" he says, before adding that he could still vote for him.. Unemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and  abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires.. When Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all. . If the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.. What did Putin do before he came to power?. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.
