        "content": "Watch: Uproar on the streets of Paris and jeers in parliament over retirement age increase. Crowds converged on Place de la Concorde in response to raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.. The plans had sparked two months of heated political debate and strikes.. Finally, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne invoked article 49:3 of the constitution - allowing the government to avoid a vote in the Assembly.. The decision was taken minutes before MPs were scheduled to vote on the controversial bill, because there was no guarantee of winning a majority.. The move caused fury among opposition politicians. Many jeered the prime minister, sang La Marseillaise and held up signs of protest in parliament.. A no-confidence motion will be filed against President Emmanuel Macron's government, far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen has suggested.. Leader of left-wing party La France Insoumise (LFI), Mathilde Panot, tweeted that Mr Macron had plunged the country into a government crisis, without parliamentary or popular legitimacy.. Thousands of people came out on the streets of Paris and other French cities to reject the move, singing the national anthem and waving trade union flags. . Some protesters clashed with police as evening fell. A fire was lit in the middle of the Place de la Concorde and police with shields and batons fired tear gas and moved to clear the square. . By nightfall, 120 people had been arrested, Paris police told AFP news agency.. But unions vowed to maintain their opposition to the pension changes, with the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) saying another day of strikes and demonstrations was being planned for Thursday 23 March.. The constitutional procedure that has prompted all this anger may sound obscure, but it is very much part of the political vocabulary in France. . Even though Mr Macron was re-elected last year on a platform of retirement reforms, his ruling coalition has no majority in the Assembly and would have needed support from the Republicans party to pass the pension changes.. Officials from Mr Macron's Renaissance party spent the morning desperately whipping members into line in a bid to pass their bill.. They knew some of their MPs could vote against or abstain, faced with the evident unpopularity of the bill, so they resorted to special constitutional powers.. But whenever a government invokes the 49:3, it can be sure it will be accused straight away of riding roughshod over the will of the people.. In fact, it has been used precisely 100 times in the more than 60 years of the Fifth Republic, and by governments of all shades.   . Obviously, it tends to be used more frequently by governments that do not have an in-built majority in parliament, such as the socialist Michel Rocard's in the 1980s and Élisabeth Borne's today.  . She has in fact already used it several times, but those occasions were for public finance bills which were less controversial.. Use of the procedure is a way to bypass a vote which might be lost, but the down side for the government is that the opposition parties can immediately table a vote of no-confidence. . If these are voted through, the government falls. That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.. The dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.. But the bill is regularly described by opponents as \"brutal\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\".. Morale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away. . This video can not be played. WATCH: French MPs boo PM and sing national anthem over pension reforms. ",

        "content": "The Palestinian health ministry said the dead included a 16-year-old boy.. Another 20 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, four of them seriously.. Israeli raids in the West Bank have become increasingly deadly since the start of the year, with both gunmen and civilians killed, as a wave of deadly Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis has continued. . More than 80 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces, and on the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks, all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. Thursday's operation in Jenin saw special forces from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Shin Bet security service and Border Police enter the city centre in the middle of the day.. A witness said they arrived in two cars and stopped in the middle of a street.. \"They opened the doors, and one of them shot Nidal Khazem in his head,\" Ahmed Khalaf told Reuters news agency.. \"The other man, our brother Youssef Shreim from [Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine] al-Qassam Brigades, tried to run away,\" he added. \"The special forces ran after him, and they started firing randomly in the street.\". \"A teenager, aged 16, was killed. He was not involved in anything. He worked at a family business.\". A video from the scene showed a man, lying on the ground and apparently already badly wounded or dead, being shot in the head at close range.. In another video, a crowd is seen throwing stones at a car being driven by Israeli forces. Multiple shots are then heard and the crowd runs away.. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed the deaths of Khazem and Shreim, who were senior figures in the militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas. It also identified the teenager as Omar Awadin and the fourth person who was killed as Luay al-Zughair, 37.. The IDF said that Khazem and another wanted militant, whom it named as Youssef Abu Ashrin, were targeted in the raid. It was not clear if the latter was Youssef Shreim.. It alleged that Khazem had been involved in \"significant terrorist activity\", and that Abu Ashrin had produced explosives and fired at Israeli soldiers. . A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called the \"brutal murder\" of four Palestinians.. \"These continuous Israeli aggressive actions confirm that Israel is not at all interested in calming the situation and preventing its eruption,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said.. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, called the killings a \"crime\" that would not go unanswered, while Islamic Jihad vowed to make Israel \"pay the price\".. The raid comes days before officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan and the US are due to hold talks in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh with the aim of de-escalating tensions ahead of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.  .

The deputy speaker of Ukraine's parliament Olena Kondratyuk said she hoped more countries would follow.. Other Nato countries are considering sending the Soviet-era planes, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.. Ukraine has previously asked Western countries for modern fighter jets, . The UK is training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard aircraft. But because of the long training times, it has warned that supplying Western jets would only ever be a long-term option.. President Biden has previously ruled out sending jets from the US to Ukraine.. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have around 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing Mig-29s and Su-27s.. President Duda said Poland still had around a dozen Soviet-era Mig 29 aircraft in operation.. Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik told the BBC: \"We need them to strengthen our air defence systems and to help our army in the spring counter-offensive. . \"It's also a good sign to everybody that getting fighter jets to Ukraine is not something unspeakable or surreal - that this is something that can happen; that the only thing that is needed to make it happen is political will.\". Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, told the BBC the Polish jets would be used \"very efficiently by our air force\".. He said in the past 24 hours, the existing Ukrainian air force had carried out 16 air strikes on Russian personnel and equipment. But he stressed that Ukraine wanted \"fourth generation\" jets, such as F-16s.. \"They are more universal platforms, they are more capable and of course they will make Ukrainian air forces more efficient,\" he said.. Poland is a strong ally of Ukraine one of the largest suppliers of military equipment. It is currently replacing its old Soviet-era planes with newer American and Korean models.. ",

It's all normal citizens who voted,\" said leader Caroline van der Plas.. The BBB aims to fight government plans to slash nitrogen emissions harmful to biodiversity by dramatically reducing livestock numbers and buying out thousands of farms.. But its appeal has spread rapidly beyond its rural heartland, on a populist platform that represents traditional, conservative Dutch social and moral values. . Shocked by the scale of their success, Ms van der Plas told supporters that voters normally stayed at home if they lost faith in politics: \"But today people have shown they can't stay at home any longer. We won't be ignored any more.\" . A left-wing Green-Labour alliance is also on course to win 15 Senate seats, while Prime Minister Mark Rutte's four-party coalition is poised to fall back to 24 - down eight seats. . Turnout in Wednesday's vote, estimated at 57.5%, was the highest for years and the biggest loser of the night was the far-right Forum for Democracy party.. For rural voters, the main incentive for backing the BBB was to protest against cuts in nitrogen emissions, according to an Ipsos poll for public broadcaster NOS.. But voters also turned out in force for the Greens, and environmental groups warned that the Netherlands' problems were not going away. . \"Restoring nature is just as necessary today and tomorrow as it was yesterday,\" tweeted Natuurmonumenten.. The run-up to the vote was dominated by the sight of farmers' tractors on the streets of The Hague and outside the venue that hosted a pre-vote leaders' debate.. Commentator Ben Coates described the result as \"something of an earthquake in Dutch politics\". . Although their policies are very much focused on opposing the government's environmental policies, he told the BBC most people would characterise them as a right-wing, populist party that was quite anti-EU, anti-immigration and in favour of banning burkas for Muslims.. Standing before supporters on Wednesday night, Caroline van der Plas wore her trademark green nail polish and a ring featuring an upside-down Dutch flag, a symbol of the anti-government protests.. The daughter of an Irish mother and a Dutch father, she lost her husband Jan to pancreatic cancer as the protests took off in 2019. She is unlike any Dutch party leader - and for many voters, that is her appeal. . She had to step back from public campaigning last year because of death threats. She was told the same fate awaited her as Pim Fortuyn, a populist leader assassinated days before the 2002 Dutch general election.. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to farmers in the rural east, she sprang to her feet in mid-sentence to avoid a bee, explaining she had been stung as a toddler and had been terrified ever since.. This video can not be played. Dutch farmers clogged up more than 1,000km during 2019's protests. ",

The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.. Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.. It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.. The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute. . On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\" . He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. . Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as .  - and the edited video released appears to back that up. . A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.  . In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.. When the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. . National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental.. But he said this did not matter because the moves were \"completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional\".. Surveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk.. Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. . Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine. . Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had \"violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation\". . But Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted.. In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary .  the remnants of the drone.. On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.. Mr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.. ",

        "content": "Video shows an official inspecting drums said to contain uranium ore. Ten drums containing the ore were found near the border with Chad, said the head of the forces' media unit.. The IAEA said it was \"actively working to verify\" media reports.. The agency sounded the alarm after a visit by its inspectors earlier this week to the undisclosed site.. The area was not in government-controlled territory.. Uranium is a naturally-occurring element that can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched.. The uranium which went missing could not be made into a nuclear weapon in its current state, but could be used as the raw material for a nuclear weapons programme, experts told the BBC.. In December 2003, under then-military ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya publicly renounced nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.. But since Col Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, the country has been divided into competing political and military factions. . It is now split between an interim, internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, and another one in the east.. Neither is in control of the south, where the uranium was taken from.. Thursday's statement on finding the drums came from the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), the military force that backs the unrecognised eastern Libyan administration.. The LNA is a coalition of military units, local, tribal and Salafi militias, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, a veteran officer who took part in the coup that brought Col Gaddafi to power in 1969.. The LNA said the containers of uranium had been found about five kilometres (three miles) from where they had been stored in southern Libya.. The IAEA says the site had been difficult to reach in recent times.. Inspectors had wanted to visit the location last year, but the trip had to be postponed because of fighting between rival Libyan militias.. Many foreign governments and groups have been vying for influence in Libya since Nato-backed forces overthrew Col Gaddafi. They include Russia's Wagner Group which backs the LNA. . The oil-rich country is largely lawless and has previously been described as an \"arms bazaar\".. In 2013, the UN reported that weapons smuggled out of Libya were fuelling conflicts in other parts of Africa and the Middle East.. The uranium that went missing was in a kind of concentrate known as \"yellow cake\" and \"doesn't really have any radiation in its current form\", said Scott Roecker from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a global security organisation working on nuclear issues.. He .  it could be used as \"feedstock\" for a nuclear weapons programme.. Mr Roecker also suggested that it could potentially be used for other purposes, such as nuclear energy, but pointed out that countries would normally buy material for that on the open market. . \"Perhaps it was stolen by someone who wants to make a profit out of this? There's a lot of scenarios around this,\" he said.. ",
