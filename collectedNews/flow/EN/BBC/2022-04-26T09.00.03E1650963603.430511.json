        "content": "The centrist president's victory over Marine Le Pen may have been convincing, but he has a problem. There are new elections around the corner to France's National Assembly and a big section of the electorate dislikes him.. \"There is a lot of hate,\" sociologist Michel Wieviorka told the BBC. \"He said last night 'I am happy' but I don't think he can be totally happy because there are plenty of clouds in his sky.\". Politically, if he fares badly in the June elections, he could end up losing his majority and may not be able to form his own government. That's why his opponents are calling the next vote a \"third round\".. Why would that matter if he's just won 58.5% of the national vote? . Many of his voters are not natural supporters and are unlikely to back him in June. A large number of far-left voters held their noses to keep the far right out of power, but then there are also a number of mainstream parties that threw their weight behind him too, including the Republicans, Greens and Socialists.. One opinion poll indicated that 63% of voters would rather he lost his majority and had to share power with an opposition government, known in France as \"co-habitation\".. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has designs on becoming prime minister himself. If that were to happen, there would be little love lost between him and the president. He claimed that Mr Macron had won the vote with the worst result in French history. Even if he was wrong, it was still a valid point that more than a third of voters had either stayed away from the election or voted for no candidate at all.. France's election winner is therefore a man in a hurry. He wants to rush through important reforms to persuade a jaded electorate to vote for his party. . Within days, he needs to form a new government, replacing Prime Minister Jean Castex, who led France through the Covid pandemic. . Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne is seen as a popular choice, because she has a strong record on social issues and it is social reforms that are his priority right now. . Mr Macron is also believed to want a woman in the job.. And she seems to understand the need for speed - especially when it comes to the issue which dominated both rounds of the presidential election: the cost of living that is causing a headache across French society and became the focus of Marine Le Pen's campaign.. \"We need to provide quick answers,\" she said.. Indeed, within hours of the election result, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised to keep in place a price cap on gas and electricity price rises until the end of 2022. . But spending is just one of four priorities Macron needs to push in the coming weeks, according to Junior Economy Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher.  The environment, education, and health are also key, with green issues a particular priority for younger voters. . And don't forget, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds did not bother to vote on Sunday.. But the flagship reform Macron is really determined to push through is controversial: raising the pension age from 62 to 65.. However, government spokesman Gabriel Attal has promised the Macron administration is in listening mode. . He insisted there would be a change of approach over the next five years, and on pensions they would redouble consultation to \"hear people's anxieties\". . Asking the French people to work three more years before they collect their pensions is not exactly a popular move, so Mr Macron is at pains to say he is flexible on how it is brought in and when. And yet his finance minister did not rule out forcing it through without a vote if they had to.. For a president sometimes dubbed Jupiter for perceived arrogance, observers see this as a critical moment for him to adapt.. \"He must accept the idea that negotiation is important, it doesn't mean top-down decisions,\" says Michel Wieviorka. \"I think it's difficult for him psychologically and culturally to change to a more democratic way of politics.\". In his victory speech, Mr Macron declared he was no longer a candidate in one camp but the president for everybody. No-one would be left by the wayside, he vowed. . He also insisted that the next five years would be handled differently from the last, without explaining how. He may not have long to prove it.. The Olympic champion who turned his back on Putin.

        "content": "The Shiretoko Peninsula is a spectacular place. It sticks far out into the northern Pacific, covered in densely forested mountains with waterfalls that cascade off high cliffs straight into the ocean. . The northern half of the peninsula is a national park and world heritage site. It is also home to Japan's largest population of Ussuri brown bears, close relatives of the north American grizzly.  . Apart from the stunning natural beauty, it is the bears that tourists come to see. And the easiest way to see them is by boat. Some companies claim to have a 90-95% success rate in getting their customers a bear sighting.. At around 10am on Saturday morning the Kazu 1 tour boat headed out of the little fishing port of Utoro - heading up the peninsula. . The boat could hold 65 passengers but on Saturday only 24 tourists were aboard. They had come from all over Japan. There were two small children, one just three years old. . The weather was bad. There were strong winds and three-metre (nine-foot) waves. This should have been enough to turn the boat around. . As the Kazu 1 headed north into stormy seas, local fishing boats were heading in the other direction, returning to port to take shelter. . The skipper of another tour boat says he told the captain of the Kazu 1 it was too dangerous to go out. But he says he was ignored. . The captain of the Kazu 1 was inexperienced at skippering at sea. . According to Japanese media, he had been trained to operate lake boats but had been hired by the Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise company to replace more experienced skippers who had been \"let go\" by the owner.  . The company was already under investigation after two previous safety incidents, including a grounding, in 2021.    . At a little after 1pm on Saturday the coast guard received a distress call. The Kazu 1 was drifting with a broken engine and taking on water close to the Kashuni Falls. This is a particularly rugged piece of the peninsula, with few beaches, and cliffs plunging straight into the sea. . In April the water is still very cold, just a few degrees above freezing. . You might think that in Japan, where safety is almost a national motto, a passenger boat operating in frigid waters would be required to have life rafts on board. . But no. In-shore passenger vessels are not required to have rafts. . The Kazu 1 had only life vests and floats for passengers to hold on to. Plunged into the freezing waters off northern Hokkaido in April an average adult would survive no more than an hour, experts say. A child much less. . But rescue would not arrive within an hour, or even two. The first coastguard helicopter would not reach the Kashuni Falls until more three hours after the first distress call was received.  . The north-east coast of Hokkaido is known as a \"blind spot\" for rescue services. . The closest helicopter base is 160km (100 miles) away. But on Saturday the closest coastguard chopper was out on another operation. It had to fly back to its base, refuel, and then head north to Shiretoko. By the time it arrived there was only 90 minutes of daylight left. . At the time of writing there are 15 passengers and crew still missing. An intense search is continuing. . But any hope of finding anyone alive is now pretty much gone. The anger and the soul searching have begun. . Important questions need to be answered: Not the least of which is why was an inexperienced skipper allowed to put to sea in treacherous conditions with completely inadequate safety equipment for the freezing waters off northern Japan?  .

        "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked the court to hold Mr Trump in contempt after he missed a March deadline to present certain documents. . Mr Trump's lawyer said she would appeal the ruling. . \"Everything that your honour and the attorney general said that we haven't done - we have done,\" attorney Alina Habba said in court. . After a \"very diligent\" search, there were simply no more relevant documents to provide, she said. . Ms James, a Democrat, opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump, a Republican, had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans.. The stakes have been raised in this year's long legal wrangle between Donald Trump and New York's dogged state attorney general. . Letitia James has accused the former president of stonewalling - and now she's successfully made it that much more costly for him not to comply with her requests. . $10,000 a day adds up quickly, and if that isn't enough to convince him to provide the requested materials, the judge could yet increase the fines further. . That's not out of the realm of possibility given the judge's remark that - while Donald Trump takes his business seriously - so does the judge. . Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing, and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In court on Monday, Ms Habba called the civil probe as a \"fishing expedition\". . Justice Engoron said a contempt finding was warranted because of what he called \"repeated failures\" to hand over the requested materials.. \"Mr Trump... I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt,\" he said, although the former president was not in the courtroom.. The attorney general's office called the ruling a \"major victory\" in the legal battle against Mr Trump. . \"Today, justice prevailed,\" said Ms James. \"For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company's financial dealings. Today's ruling makes clear: no one is above the law.\". The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices..

        "content": "Nina Malenok's home is just by the side of a road that Russian troops used as they began their invasion of Ukraine, on their way to the northern city of Chernihiv, and the capital Kyiv. . Wedged into the yard of Nina's home is the tail of a rocket fired in the early hours of the 24 February - the day the war started. . \"I heard it land in my yard. There was fire and smoke everywhere. My lights went off. I jumped out of bed and ran out my house,\" said Nina.. In the days that followed, hidden in a cellar, she heard planes flying overhead, heavy vehicles driving in and whistles being frequently blown.. On 8 March, Russian TV journalists came to her home accompanied by Russian soldiers. . \"They were filming everything here, all the shells and everything. They told me Ukraine was attacking itself. Then they sent the numbers [printed] on the rocket to someone in Russia, and received a response right away that it was one of theirs.\". Many such rockets are scattered all over the village. Experts who've seen images of the rockets have told the BBC that they could have been carrying cluster bombs, banned in other parts of the world for the devastation they cause. Both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of using them. . Even after the withdrawal, Nina does not feel safe. . \"It's scary to live like this, but I'm used to my house, Where will I go? I can hear the shelling. I can show you from my yard the Russian checkpoint,\" she said.. Her home, and others in the village are visible from Russia. Its troops can see what they have been firing at.. For Lidiya Bilousova, it's the second time in her life she saw tanks at her doorstep.. Born in 1930, she vividly remembers World War Two and German soldiers coming into their village. . 'We'd been warned by our retreating soldiers that they would be coming. So we hid in the trenches with dry bread in cloth bags. At dawn, they were in our streets, with their horses and machinery, crossing our gardens with machine guns. But there was no mass shelling like there is now,\" she said. \"Back in the day, I could run away. Now I'm old. I can't anymore.\". \"Here's what I'll tell you, there is nothing good about war,\" Lidiya said. \"After the last war [World War Two] what were we left with?\". The shelling frightens her, but she is unwilling to leave the home she's lived in for most of her life. . Prior to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, the three-way border crossing would be opened and a unity festival would be celebrated at the point where the countries meet, where a monument dedicated to the friendship between them called \"Three Sisters\" still stands. . 'It was a beautiful festival. We, the Russians, the Belarusians would celebrate together. People from all over, important dignitaries would all come,\" she said. . Lidiya's late husband was Belarusian. . \"The three countries were friends for years, we visited each other, married each other. Now it's over.\". Families and friendships spread across borders have been divided, both in thought and in distance. After 2014, crossing the border became harder for people on all sides. Now, it's impossible..

Nina Malenok said she's stopped talking to her brother who lives in Belarus.. \"He says it's America who attacked you, and you blame Russia.

        "content": "Many Twitter users are also asking whether this means accounts suspended by the company will be allowed back.. The most high-profile person to have been suspended was Donald Trump.. After the news of the deal was announced, human rights groups raised concerns about hate speech on Twitter and the power it would give Mr Musk, who is a self-described \"free speech absolutist\".. He has been vocal in his criticism of the platform's policies on moderating content, arguing that Twitter needs to be a genuine forum for free speech.. In a statement after striking the deal he described free speech as \"the bedrock of a functioning democracy\".. In a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: \"We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.. \"The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others.\". Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.. Donald Trump's account was terminated permanently last year in the wake of the 6 January riots at the Capitol building in Washington.. But even if his Twitter ban is reversed, Mr Trump says he does not plan to return to Twitter, instead opting to use his own platform, Truth Social. . \"I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,\" Mr Trump told Fox News. . He added that he believed Mr Musk, who he called a \"good man\", will \"make improvements\" to the platform. . Representatives of Mr Trump did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. Ming-Chi Kuo, a technology analyst at investment management firm TF International Securities, told the BBC that Mr Trump may decide to return to the platform if he runs in the 2024 US presidential election.. \"Twitter is still a better choice for him to have a voice, if Twitter is willing to restore his account,\" Mr Kuo said. . \"It's not easy to build a platform with more influence than Twitter before the next presidential election.\". Mr Musk said that he hopes that even his strongest critics will remain on the platform \"because that is what free speech means\". . However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.. British actress Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to \"become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space\". . \"I would like this to be my... last tweet,\" Ms Jamil told her one million followers.. Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.. Ms Bueno said \"we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership\". . \"What we do know is that if all the decent people leave, it'll get bad here a whole lot faster,\" she added.. Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expects most users to \"take a wait-and-see approach\". . \"Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform,\" Mr Ives said.  . The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer. . Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and still sits on its board, said he was happy the platform \"will continue to serve the public conversation\", even though he does not believe \"anyone should own or run Twitter\".. \"It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company,\" Mr Dorsey said in a tweet on Tuesday.. \"Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust,\" Mr Dorsey added. \"I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.\". Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain, according to the Reuters news agency.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. . On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden \"has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms\", whoever owns or runs Twitter.. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was \"dangerous for our democracy\", while pushing for a wealth tax and \"strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable\".. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as \"an encouraging day for freedom of speech\". . This video can not be played.
