        "content": "Mr Carter, 98, has suffered from recent health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.. The country's oldest living leader, he served one term in office from 1977-81.. During his tenure as president Mr Carter faced a spate of foreign policy challenges and the Democrat was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan. . \"He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,\" the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday.. Terminally ill patients may seek hospice care instead of going through further medical treatment. The priority is not to provide further treatment, but to provide comfort towards the end of a patient's life. . Mr Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator, tweeted that he visited \"both of my grandparents yesterday.\". \"They are at peace and - as always - their home is full of love. Thank you all for your kind words,\" he said. . In 2021, Mr Carter and his wife Roslyn celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They have four children together.. Born in Georgia in 1924, Mr Carter entered politics in the 1960s when he was elected as state senator, before becoming the state's governor in 1971.. Five years later he defeated the sitting Republican President Gerald Ford to become the 39th commander-in-chief. . But problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter as president. . At home, an oil crisis produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures.. The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treaty returning control of the Panama Canal to Panama.. But in 1979 the last Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in the aftermath. Mr Carter cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in response and introduced a trade embargo.. However, the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped as the US hostages were held for 444 days. His approval ratings took a further hit after an attempt to rescue the hostages failed and eight US military members were killed.. Iran then delayed the release of the hostages until after Ronald Reagan was sworn in.. Since leaving the White House, Mr Carter has remained active, carrying out humanitarian work with his Carter Center.. He led a delegation that sought to persuade military leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there.. He went on to gain an international reputation for his work in promoting human rights, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.. With Nelson Mandela, he founded The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights. . He also travelled extensively - well into his early 90s - and took part in annual trips to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity charity. . But the former president has also battled a host of health issues in recent years. In August 2015, Mr Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. . The following year he announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. . He has frequently expressed a striking calmness when dealing with his health challenges. . \"I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,\" he said in 2015. \"I've had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.\". Mr Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife were born between the First World War and the Great Depression, and where they returned when he left office. . A host of senior US politicians - including Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock - offered their thoughts and prayers to Mr Carter's family as news broke on Saturday night. . \"In this tender time of transitioning, God is surely walking with him,\" Senator Warnock tweeted. \"May he, Rosalynn & the entire Carter family be comforted with that peace and surrounded by our love & prayers.\".

        "content": "\"I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,\" he said.. But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to \"crush\" the nation.. The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.. \"I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,\" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.. \"Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.\" . Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.. But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.. The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to \"bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace\".. He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, describing similar efforts around the world as a \"total failure\".. Despite Mr Macron's comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine's leaders.. On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.. Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the \"terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics\", he said.. President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was \"no trust\" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also .  to strike a peace deal with Moscow.. Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.. Last June, he was .  for saying it was vital that Russia was not \"humiliated over its invasion\".. Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was \"humiliating itself\" - needed to be put in its place.. ",

        "content": "Pyongyang said the test showed it was capable of countering hostile forces like the US and South Korea.. It comes ahead of joint exercises between Washington and Seoul next month, designed to help fend off North Korea's increasing nuclear threats.. Authorities in Pyongyang have threatened to unleash an \"unprecedently strong\" retaliation to any such drills - which it insists are being done in preparation to invade North Korea.. This was reinforced early on Sunday by Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who said any hostile acts would be met with a \"strong and overwhelming\" response. She also urged the US to end what she called \"threats\" against the regime. . But she added that the South Korean capital, Seoul, would not be targeted by North Korean missiles.. On Friday, North Korea showed off its massive military might in a parade that included more than a dozen ICBMs.. Saturday's missile, which is the first to be launched since new year's day, splashed down west of Hokkaido, in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) at 18:27 (09:27 GMT), Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. An EEZ is an area of the sea that a country has jurisdiction over. Japan's is a 200-nautical mile area off its coast.. It reached an altitude of 5,700km (3,510 miles), government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said in Tokyo. While that is incredibly high - the edge of space is about 100km - it is not the highest a North Korean missile has flown.. In November, an ICBM reached an altitude of 6,100km. Previously, in January 2022, .  of the Earth that it claimed were taken from a missile launch that reached 2,000km.. ICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range, including mainland United States.  . Japan's Defence Minister Hamada Yasukazu said Saturday's missile would have been able to do this, with a possible range of 14,000km.. \"This series of actions by North Korea threatens the peace and stability of Japan and the international community, and is absolutely unforgivable,\" Mr Matsuno said. . North Korea's \"reckless behaviour\" was condemned by the G7 foreign ministers, who are attending a summit in Germany. In a statement, they said it \"threatens regional and international peace and security\" and the UN Security Council needed to take more significant measures against Pyongyang.. South Korea's military reported the missile was launched from the Sunan district, north of Pyongyang, where the international airport is located. It is also where North Korea has launched most of its recent ICBM tests.. North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are banned by the UN Security Council. But this has not stopped Pyongyang from continuing with its weapons development, and holding elaborate military parades to show them off.. Just over a week ago, .  in a midnight military parade which was attended by leader Kim Jong-un.. ",

        "content": "But now an investigation .  has revealed more details.. According to the investigation, M'Barki ran reports on a variety of subjects - luxury yachts in Monaco, a Sudanese opposition leader, allegations of corruption in Qatar - that had all one thing in common: they were planted by an Israel-based outfit specialising in 'news for hire'.. M'Barki has denied being paid to run the stories, but he admits to bypassing BFM's editorial checks.  . He says he was offered the reports by an intermediary and exercised his own professional judgment in selecting to use them.. But the investigators say they have evidence that the origin of the stories lies in the shadowy Team Jorge, an operation based in Tel Aviv and run by a former Israeli special forces officer whose real name is Tal Hanan.. According to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories, Team Jorge is one of several players in a growing world of disinformation mercenaries - private sector experts in intelligence who for a price will use the internet to damage an enemy's reputation or influence an election.. To get access to Team Jorge, three journalists from the Forbidden Stories consortium posed as potential clients seeking to shape opinion in French-speaking Africa on behalf of a major multinational. . After a lengthy negotiation, they finally arranged a face-to-face meeting and got what amounted to a sales pitch.. Hanan claimed to have intervened in more than 30 elections and to have access to email and social media accounts of prominent African figures.. Central to the Team Jorge offer was a platform called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (AIMS), which generates tens of thousands of fake identities with accounts on Facebook and Telegram. These accounts then spread the content of a campaign.. The investigators identified around 20 different international campaigns which they believed Team Jorge had organised. . Among the material being circulated on social media, they especially noticed two television news reports in French that purportedly ran on BFM.. After checking with BFM's management, they had confirmation: the reports were shown late at night on the channel, but without the knowledge of the editorial team. . At that point, on January 11, M'Barki was called in and suspended.. The first of the reports was on the EU's Russia sanctions, and their impact on the luxury yacht business in Monaco. . It was claimed that 10,000 jobs were at risk and that the industry had appealed to Prince Albert to intervene on their behalf. None of that has been proved.. The second report, broadcast in mid-December, was about a leafleting campaign in Paris accusing a former state prosecutor in Qatar of corruption.. When originally shown in the early hours of the morning, the reports would have gone almost unobserved.  . But that changed when they were picked up by social media and Team Jorge's massed avatars. Suddenly they were viral.. By seemingly planting the reports onto mainstream French television, the organisers would have immeasurably boosted the credibility of what would otherwise have been unsubstantiated gossip.  . It also would mean Team Jorge had evidence for future clients of its access to western media.. M'Barki's late night show also ran items on a Sudanese general who was considering running for the presidency, and a trade show in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. . In this second piece, the name of the territory was replaced by the politically-charged term Moroccan Sahara.. The area has been the subject of .  between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.. The people or organisations that ultimately commissioned the suspected campaigns remain a mystery, according to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories.  . Some may have been commissioned by governments, but most - like the yacht story - were probably ordered by private interests, the investigation concluded.. A worrying sign, the investigators say, of the growing \"Uberisation\" of the fake news business.. ",
