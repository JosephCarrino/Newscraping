        "content": "To persuade the public, the news anchor portrayed President Putin as a sea captain steering the good ship Russia through stormy waters of global unrest.. \"Russia is an oasis of stability, a safe harbour,\" he continued. \"If it wasn't for Putin what would have become of us?\". So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. . Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia's neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. . Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. . All problems of Titanic proportions.. So why did Russia's president set a course for war and territorial conquest? . \"On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,\" points out political scientist Ekaterina Shulman. . \"Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?\" . Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. . The Kremlin had expected its \"special military operation\" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia's orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine's capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.. Russia's leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin's way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.. Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?. This week he gave us some clues. . His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.. The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that \"there are battles going on right now on [Russia's] historical frontiers\" and praised Russia's \"courageous warriors\".  . Conclusion: don't expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.. \"If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,\" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin's former economic adviser. \"There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.\". But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  . \"It's possible to sit down with anyone,\" Andrei Illarionov continues, \"but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. . \"Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.\". When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow's assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. . And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine's stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: \"Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own security…\"  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.. Putin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the \"collective West\", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia's enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.. But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia's economy even more. . As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia's Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. . Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. . \"Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,\" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there's a chance to redistribute wealth.\". \"The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.\". \"Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?\" I ask Konstantin.. \"Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.\". \"And does Putin know these discussions are happening?\". \"He knows. I think he knows everything.\". This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament declared: \"As long as there's Putin, there's Russia.\" . It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin's fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial. But Alex Murdaugh, 54, denied ever hurting Maggie or Paul Murdaugh, who were fatally shot at the family's secluded hunting estate in June 2021.. The former lawyer took the stand on Thursday in week five of the trial. . Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison without parole if convicted.. The trial in Walterboro has rocked the southern corner of South Carolina, where the defendant's family has dominated the legal landscape for more than a century. . Prosecutors have argued that Mr Murdaugh killed Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, in a desperate attempt to gain sympathy and conceal a decade of financial crimes. . Mr Murdaugh, who has admitted to stealing from clients and colleagues, is facing nearly 100 separate financial charges, with prosecutors alleging he stole about $8.8m (£7.3m).. The defence team has dismissed this theory at trial, saying Mr Murdaugh would never have \"butchered\" his family. . In court on Thursday, Mr Murdaugh wept as he recalled the night he found Maggie and Paul dead.  . \"I saw what y'all have seen pictures of,\" he told jurors, referring to graphic photos of the crime scene. \"So bad.\". And he addressed perhaps the most incriminating element of the prosecution's case: that he had lied about being with Maggie and Paul at the dog kennels on the family property shortly before they were killed. . A mobile phone video taken at the kennels by Paul about five minutes before prosecutors say the killings took place, which featured both Alex Murdaugh and Maggie's voices in the background, contradicted the defendant's claims that he had been napping inside the family home. . \"Once I lied,\" he said, \"I continued to lie.\" He blamed the earlier denials on paranoia from his years-long addiction to painkillers. . That addiction also featured prominently in his testimony. Mr Murdaugh told jurors a knee injury in college led to a deep dependence on oxycodone, one that he drained his bank account to sate. . \"I'm not quite sure how I let myself get where I got,\" Mr Murdaugh said. . Mr Murdaugh also referenced one of the more bizarre elements of his saga: a bogus attempt on his life. . He called police in September 2021 - nearly three months after the murders of his wife and son - saying he had been shot in the head on the side of a rural road.. But he later admitted he had paid a distant cousin to shoot him, hoping his surviving son, Buster, could then collect on his life insurance policy.. The jury also heard a recording of the 911 call Mr Murdaugh made after his wife and son were killed. In it, he is heard saying: \"I should have known.\" . Mr Murdaugh explained his statement by saying his son Paul had been the subject of death threats on social media that the family did not take seriously. . \"We disregarded it because it was so over the top,\" he said.. Through hours of questioning, Mr Murdaugh maintained a mostly contrite demeanour, even under cross-examination by lead prosecutor Creighton Waters. . An animated Mr Waters, who paced around the court during questioning, pushed Mr Murdaugh with increasing intensity on a litany of alleged financial crimes. . \"I was wrong,\" Mr Murdaugh said, over and over again. \"I remember stealing from people, I remember lying to people and I remember misleading people.\"   . But Mr Murdaugh rejected assertions by Mr Waters that he was concerned about his \"financial house of cards\" collapsing.  . \"You have charged me with the murder of my wife and son and I have sat here for all these weeks listening to all this financial stuff that I did wrong, that I'm embarrassed by,\" Mr Murdaugh said. . But he denied resorting to violence.. Cross-examination will resume tomorrow.. ",

        "content": "Moldova has warned for weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. And officials rejected Russia's claims as \"psy-ops\" as part of the war.. \"The defence ministry believes it is an element of a psychological operation rather than a real plan,\" said state secretary Valeriu Mija.. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. . \"Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,\" she said.. Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country's sovereignty.. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine's power grid had knock-on effects.. Rampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. . There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as \"hybrid attacks\". . A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what his predecessor called \"multiple crises\".. President Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova's leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\".. Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match.. The Kremlin accused Moldova's leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.. Political analyst Denis Cenusa said . . If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.. On Moldova's eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. Dominated by Russian speakers, it proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. . A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.. As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria.  . That has not happened, but what Moldova's leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.. A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.. Ukrainian \"infiltrators\" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria's authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.. Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.. The head of Transnistria's peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia's warnings did \"give reasons for serious concerns\".. ",
