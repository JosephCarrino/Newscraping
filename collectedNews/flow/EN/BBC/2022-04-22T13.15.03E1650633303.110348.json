        "content": "Speaking from the Azovstal plant - the last part of Mariupol not under Russian control - Svyatoslav Palamar from the controversial Azov regiment said defenders had repelled waves of Russian attacks.. \"I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine,\" he said.. Earlier President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks - a maze of tunnels and workshops - and ordered his troops to seal it off instead.. \"Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot pass through,\" he said. . Much of Mariupol has been destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting. Taking the Sea of Azov port is a key Russian war aim and would release more troops to join a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. Capt Palamar said the Russians had fired on the steel plant from warships and dropped \"bunker-busting\" bombs on it. . The BBC has not been able to verify any of his account. But it tallies with testimony earlier this week from a . , who said fighters were outnumbered and running out of supplies.. \"All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings,\" Capt Palamar said.. The Azov regiment was originally a far-right neo-Nazi group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Its fighters along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers are the last Ukrainian defenders left in the city.. When asked how many Ukrainian defenders remained in Mariupol, Capt Palamar answered simply \"enough to repel attacks\".. He said that civilians were in separate locations away from fighters. They were in basements containing 80-100 people each but it was unclear how many civilians there were in total as some buildings had been destroyed and fighters could not reach them because of shelling. Entrances to some of the bunkers were blocked by heavy concrete slabs that only heavy machinery could move, he said.. \"We keep in touch with those civilians who stay in places that we can get to. We know that there are small children there as young as three months old,\" he said. . The fighter appealed for civilians to be given safe passage out of the steelworks and called for a third country or an international body to act as a guarantor for their safety.. \"These people have got through a lot already, through war crimes. They don't trust Russians, and they are scared,\" he said, adding that they feared torture and murder at the hands of Russian troops or deportation to Russia through so-called filtration camps.. Elderly civilians in the steelworks were in need of medicine while there were also about 500 seriously wounded fighters who were not getting the care they needed - including major surgery such as amputations.. \"After 52 days of blockade and heavy fighting we are running of medicines. And then we also keep unburied bodies of our fighters whom we need to bury with dignity in Ukraine-controlled territory,\" he said.. Capt Palamar said Ukrainian defenders also wanted to secure their own evacuation if possible - but there could be no question of surrender. . \"As for surrender in exchange for the safe way out for civilians, I hope we all know whom we are dealing with. We definitely know that all guarantees, all statements of the Russian Federation are worth nothing.\". He said many of the defenders left in Azovstal came from Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He himself had been married there and his child had been born there.. \"I witnessed how this city was developing. How this city became the pearl of Azov and it's a hometown for me as well,\" he said.. \"Russia is not renewing or rebuilding anything. It aims to destroy and terrorise... If we fall this horde will go further and the whole civilised world will be in danger.\" . Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing civilian shelters and of using weapons banned or restricted by international law - including phosphorus bombs and cluster munitions - in attacks on Azovstal. . Ukraine as well as the US and UK have announced investigations into the possible use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, something Russia has denied.

        "content": "In reality, though, little here could be described as normal. Normality ended on 24 February when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine for his \"Special Military Operation\".. I have experienced Communist Russia. I have lived through post-Soviet Russia. Now the world's largest country has metamorphosed again. . Let me take you on a tour of \"Special Military Operation Russia\".. I get in the car to drive to the supermarket. By force of habit, I switch on the radio. It's tuned to 91.2 FM - once the home of Radio Echo of Moscow. Echo was my favourite Russian radio station - a reliable source of news and information. . But in recent weeks all independent Russian news outlets have either been blocked or shut down.  Broadcasting now on 91.2 FM is state-run Radio Sputnik, which backs the Russian offensive in Ukraine.. Driving along the Garden Ring, I pass a theatre which has erected on its fa√ßade a giant Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation. There's another Z outside the headquarters of Russian Railways. I overtake a lorry that has a Z sticker on the side. In recent weeks Zs have been graffitied on the front doors of Kremlin critics.. At the shopping mall, business is far from booming. Many of the shops - international brands - have shut down. Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine, hundreds of foreign companies have suspended operations in Russia. . In the supermarket, the shelves are full. Last month's sugar shortage in Russia - the result of panic buying - appears to have been resolved. But the range of products seems smaller than before. And over the last two months prices have shot up. . Outside the shopping centre, I get chatting to Nadezhda, a doctor. . \"Prices are so high, it's impossible to survive now on my salary,\" Nadezhda tells me. . \"But the hardest thing of all is living in a society that doesn't want to know the truth about events in Ukraine. People are too busy worrying about their mortgage payments, paying off their debts. They're not interested in what's going on around them. But I think that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible. I'm ashamed to be Russian.\". I drive to the Moscow engineering institute where, 30 years ago, I used to teach English. . Back in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism, my students here were full of hope that Russia and the West would forge a lasting friendship and partnership; that the future would be peaceful and prosperous. . That didn't work out.. \"We'll overcome all our difficulties. After sunset always comes the dawn,\" says Denis, a student, outside the institute. . \"But I support our troops. They are our soldiers. I am obliged to support my country come what may.\". My final destination is the giant war museum that celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two - a glorious victory, achieved at enormous human cost. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. . What I find disturbing is how the \"Special Military Operation\" has found a place in this museum, how it's being honoured here. . On the museum's website, the spelling of the word \"museum\" has been altered to feature the letter Z. In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring \"Putin is My PreZident\". . And the museum is currently hosting an exhibition about Nazis in Ukraine. That helps to cement the Kremlin's bogus claim that the Russian army is liberating Ukraine from Nazism. . This is \"Special Military Operation Russia\" - a parallel universe, Orwellian, where invasion is liberation, where aggression is self-defence and where critics are traitors.. It feels like the Russia I have known for the last 30 years has gone.. This video can not be played. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. The surprising benefits of this humble veg.

Shanghai city officials said all infected patients and close contacts will be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine. . In addition, disinfection measures will be escalated in some of the city's worst-hit areas. This will likely mean some residents will be forced to move out temporarily - including those who have tested negative.. The move comes days after people in two other Shanghai communities - Beicai and Pingwang - were ordered to leave their residences for temporary accommodations. . In Beicai, an official notice issued to residents told them to pack their belongings and leave their wardrobe doors open.. They were also told to leave open the front door of their home and their pets behind. Images on social media of people queuing with packed suitcases at night-time showed the scale of the operation.. As the vast lockdown approaches its fifth week authorities show no sign of easing up in their determination to maintain China's now battered \"zero Covid\" strategy. . In fact they're escalating. . In the worst hit areas, people's homes will be disinfected. This will likely mean some residents are forced to move out temporarily, even those who've tested negative. . We can make this assertion because earlier this week the BBC reported on the mass evacuation and forced removal of hundreds of people from their homes in at least two areas of the city, to allow for mass cleansing. . Shanghai city officials also re-iterated something that remains crucial - that all infected patients and close contacts should be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine centres. They want people discharged sooner, once they are negative. . But as the Party mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper said on its front page last week, \"persistence is victory\". . The latest measures signals the lengths to which Chinese authorities are willing to go to stop the spread of Covid in Shanghai - regarded as the country's financial and business hub. . Some in locked-down areas of the city have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. The lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies.. Officials are still trying to maintain the country's zero-Covid strategy which prioritises eliminating the virus over living with it as many countries have now chosen to do. . But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run.. The latest outbreak in Shanghai, first detected in late March, has seen more than 400,000 cases recorded so far and 36 deaths. Nearly all were elderly, unvaccinated residents with underlying health problems, according to Chinese officials. . As a result, the city's 25 million people have been ordered to stay home..

Russian troops control most of Mariupol after weeks of bombardment and fighting, but some Ukrainian forces remain in a sprawling steelworks in the city. President Putin has abandoned plans to storm the Azovstal plant and instead told troops to seal it off.. The alleged mass grave is near a village called Manhush about 20km (12 miles) west of Mariupol. Maxar said there were four sections of linear rows about 85m long. . The BBC has not independently verified the images.. Mariupol city council earlier issued its own statement accusing the Russians of burying civilians at the same location.. The council said the Russians were digging trenches and \"using dump lorries to bring the bodies\" and provided its own aerial image of the site, which it said was \"already twice as large as the nearby cemetery\".. The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko says tens of thousands of civilians may have been killed in Mariupol . Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations by Ukraine and its Western allies that Russian troops and top Kremlin politicians are responsible for mass killings of civilians.. Earlier this month, Maxar images of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv appeared to show bodies of civilians lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town as part of a withdrawal from northern Ukraine.. The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, contradicted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha had been \"staged\" after the Russians withdrew.. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said that least 300 civilians were killed in the town.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. The surprising benefits of this humble veg.
