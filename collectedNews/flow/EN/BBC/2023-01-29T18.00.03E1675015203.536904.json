        "content": "Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols. Scorpion stands for \"Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\".. The unit is a 50-person team tasked with bringing down crime levels in particular areas.. But now it is being abolished after its officers were seen beating Mr Nichols, 29, in the videos from 7 January.. In a statement, the department said \"it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate\" the unit. . \"While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonour on the title Scorpion, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department, take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted,\" it added.. Mr Nichols' family welcomed the decision in a statement from their lawyers, calling it \"both appropriate and proportional to the tragic death of Tyre Nichols, and also a decent and just decision for all citizens of Memphis\".. The unit was launched in October 2021 with a focus on high-impact crimes, such as car thefts and gang-related offences.. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired last week.. They were taken into custody on Thursday and each faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.. Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who \"appeared on the scene following\" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation. . \"The unit that murdered Tyre has been permanently disbanded,\" a protester shouted into a megaphone in Memphis and the crowd erupted into cheers. . Despite the rain, the group of fewer than 100 protesters had gathered in the square in front of the Memphis Police headquarters to demand change to a system of policing that they said makes a habit of brutalising black people in Memphis and across the country.   . \"Memphis is taking a stand,\" said Casio Montez, one of the protest organisers. \"This means we're doing something right.\". Mr Montez vowed that he and other community organisers would continue to pressure Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis and city officials until \"the community's demands are met\", including reforming the department's organised crime unit.  . In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Chief Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be \"more responsive\" and \"more proactive\" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols \"decided to go off the rails\".   . \"We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,\" she said. \"This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.\"  . But for some, the problem of police violence is more deeply rooted than any reform can address. . At the rally Saturday, Memphis native Allie Watkins held a sign that proclaimed, \"All cops uphold white supremacy.\"  . The sign is historically accurate, she said, because the history of policing in America began with slave patrols.  . \"This is not an issue of corruption in the United States, this is an issue of the fact that the system has been built against black bodies,\" she said.  If the system is broken, she added, the only way to fix it is to start again.. \"We need to have national criminal justice reform\", Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the BBC. She said units like the Scorpion unit exist \"across the country\" so piecemeal reform was not going to be a solution. . Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January.. Mr Nichols was black, as are all five officers charged in the case.. Memphis Police Department released four graphic videos of the traffic stop and its violent aftermath on Friday, totalling more than an hour of footage.. Peaceful protests took place in Memphis on Friday night after the video was released, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in the city, while small-scale demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country.. Many protesters held banners demanding justice for Mr Nichols and an end to \"police terror\".. Lawyers for Mr Nichols' family likened the assault to the 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King.. The Scorpion programme was touted by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland in a speech a year ago. He said the city used crime data \"to determine where the unit will conduct its enforcement activities within the city\".. From October 2021 until January 2022, the unit made 566 arrests, he said. They also seized more than $100,000 in cash, 270 vehicles and 253 weapons.. In the wake of Mr Nichols' death, one local man, Cornell McKinney, told a Memphis-area TV network that he had a tense encounter with the unit on 3 January, just days before the incident involving Mr Nichols.. Mr McKinney alleges that the officers - who were travelling in unmarked vehicles - threatened to \"blow his head off\", pointed a weapon at his head and accused him of carrying drugs.. He complained to the Memphis Police Department after the incident, but says he has not heard anything back.. One of the officers that arrested Mr Nichols had previously been sued by a man who accused him of beating him when he was a prisoner eight years ago.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Footage shows the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols. Lawyers for his family said the officers acted like a \"pack of wolves\" and beat him \"like a human pinata\".. Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, who is the first black woman to serve in the role, told the BBC she was shocked. \"Something happened that we can't explain,\" she said.. The videos prompted the authorities to fire the five officers earlier this week, and then to charge them with offences including second-degree murder.. On Friday evening, the videos were released to the public. The footage did show the harrowing events that led to Mr Nichols' death, but many questions still remain.. While the four videos contain over an hour of footage total, capturing multiple angles taken from police body cameras and a pole-mounted surveillance camera, one crucial element is missing: how did all this begin?. His family has said that Mr Nichols, an avid photographer, was out driving so he could take pictures of the sunset.. Officers initially said Mr Nichols was pulled over for alleged reckless driving, but police on Friday said there is no evidence to substantiate that claim. . The footage released only begins after police confront him at an intersection at 8:24pm local time - police say the initial traffic stop was not filmed but we don't know why. . He is immediately dragged out of the car and thrown to the ground by officers with guns drawn.. \"I didn't do anything!\" Mr Nichols says early on, and he complies with the officers' instructions. . An officer shouts: \"Put your hands behind your back before I break your [expletive].\". \"You guys are really doing a lot right now,\" Mr Nichols says to the officers. \"I'm just trying to go home.\". Later in the video, we hear an officer telling other officers who have arrived at the scene that Mr Nichols swerved and almost hit his police vehicle, but we see no evidence of this.. Another officer claims he thinks Mr Nichols may be \"on something,\" which implies they believed he may have been using drugs. There is no known evidence that this was the case, and later in the video, officers say they did not find anything in his car.. From the get-go, the officers are very hostile, cursing at Mr Nichols and telling him to lie on the ground or they will tase him.. In the videos, Mr Nichols is initially compliant, if confused, by the officers' hostility. He lies down on the ground as instructed, as they attempt to handcuff him.. But when one of them tries to tase him, he breaks free and tries to run, at which point police pepper spray him.. How he broke free, and why police were so aggressive in the first place, is not clear.. \"It was incomprehensible, from beginning to end,\" Greg Donaldson, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told the BBC.. \"From the car stop, the state of agitation of the police when they pulled the car over, to the pursuit, to the lack of training and lack of strategy in containing and subduing the person they had stopped.\". Mr Donaldson says the video seems to show that police anger grows \"as their incompetence seems to be more revealed\".. Spraying his eyes with water after feeling the effects of the pepper spray himself, one of the officers says they should \"stomp\" him when they catch him.. That is exactly what they do in the videos that captured the second encounter which began at 8:32pm. For several minutes, police punched and kicked him, in the body and the head, while Mr Nichols cried for his mother. One officer is seen wandering away, breathing heavily. Almost a minute later, he returns to the scene, pulls out his extendable baton and strikes Mr Nichols repeatedly. . None of the officers try to stop him, or another who is seen punching Mr Nichols in the head at least five times.. \"This incident just ran out of control,\" Mr Donaldson says. . It is evident from the footage that Mr Nichols is in distress after the beating. He writhes on the ground before being slumped up against a car, unable to properly sit up himself.. \"The worst part of it was was the lack of humanity after the incident,\" Mr Donaldson says.. The officers \"stood around like its as just an afternoon on the street,\" he says, while leaving Mr Nichols \"laying there on the ground like a piece of garbage\".. There are more officers on the scene than bodycams released, and we do not know if there is additional footage.. Medics arrive to examine Mr Nichols at 8:41pm. Twenty minutes later a stretcher comes into view in the video and then an ambulance arrives. We don't know how long it is before Mr Nichols is taken to hospital. . Although it is clear Mr Nichols was severely beaten, we still do not know what actually caused his death in hospital three days later.. In the video, we do see police kick him in the head twice, and there is blood visible around his face.. Attorneys for his family have said that an independent autopsy found that he suffered \"extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating,\" but the full report has not been made public. . ",

        "content": "One drone was destroyed by air defence systems and two were caught by \"defence traps\", causing minor damage to a building, the ministry added.. The extent of damage to the site has not been confirmed by the BBC, and there has been no immediate claim of responsibility.. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said the \"cowardly\" incident was an attempt to destabilise the country.. But he added that the incident would not impact Iran's \"determination and intention regarding the peaceful nuclear progress\".. It comes amid heightened tensions over Iran's nuclear programme and its supply of arms to Russia's war in Ukraine.. The country has also been wracked by internal turmoil in recent months, spurred by the death of a woman who was detained for violating Iran's strict dress code.. In a statement to Iranian state media, the defence ministry said the drone strike happened on Saturday night at around 23:30 local time (20:00 GMT).. Local authorities did not comment on activities at the site, but called it a \"workshop\". The IRNA news agency said the strike had targeted \"an ammunition manufacturing plant\".. Isfahan province is home to a large air base and several nuclear sites, including Natanz, which is at the centre of Iran's uranium enrichment programme. . In a separate incident on Saturday, the IRNA new agency reported a fire broke out at an oil facility near the north-western city of Tabriz. No details about the cause have been revealed.. In recent years, there have been a number of explosions, fires and cyber attacks on Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities.. After Iran accused Israel of sabotaging the key nuclear facility near the city of Natanz in 2021, Israel's defence chief said the country's operations in the region \"are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy\".. And in 2020 Iran alleged that Israel was behind the assassination one of its top nuclear scientists, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. . ",

        "content": "The new measures also include depriving an attacker's family members of residency and social security rights.. The full cabinet is due to consider the measures on Sunday.. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised a \"strong\" and \"swift\" response ahead of the security cabinet meeting.. Israel's army also said it would be reinforcing troop numbers in the occupied West Bank.. \"When civilians have guns, they can defend themselves,\" the controversial far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told reporters outside a Jerusalem hospital.. The measures will revoke the rights to social security of \"the families of terrorists that support terrorism\", the security cabinet said.. The proposals are in step with proposals from Mr Netanyahu's far-right political allies, who allowed him to return to power last month.. The announcement came after Israeli police said a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was behind a shooting in Jerusalem's Silwan neighbourhood on Saturday that left an Israeli father and son seriously wounded.. An Israeli police force spokesperson previously said the assailant ambushed five people as they made their way to prayers, leaving two in a \"critical condition\". The 13-year-old was shot and injured by passers-by and is being held in hospital. . In a separate shooting on Friday at a synagogue in East Jerusalem, seven people were killed and at least three more injured as they gathered for prayers at the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The gunman was shot dead at the scene.. The man behind Friday's synagogue attack was identified by local media as a Palestinian from East Jerusalem.. Police have arrested 42 people in connection with that attack.. Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai called it \"one of the worst attacks we have encountered in recent years\". . Palestinian militant groups praised the attack, but did not say one of their members was responsible.. Mr Netanyahu called for calm and urged citizens to allow security forces to carry out their tasks, while the military said additional troops would be deployed in the occupied West Bank. . \"I call again on all Israelis - don't take the law into your hands,\" Mr Netanyahu said. He thanked several world leaders - including US President Joe Biden - for their support. . Tensions have been high since nine Palestinians - both militants and civilians - were killed during an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.  . This was followed by rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, which Israel responded to with air strikes.. Since the start of January, 30 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed in the West Bank. . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suspended its security co-operation arrangements with Israel after Thursday's raid in Jenin.. Friday's synagogue shooting happened on Holocaust Memorial Day, which commemorates the six million Jews and other victims who were killed in the Holocaust by the Nazi regime in Germany.  . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, saying that one of the victims was a Ukrainian woman. . \"Terror must have no place in today's world - neither in Israel nor Ukraine,\" he said in a tweet. . British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly wrote on Twitter: \"To attack worshippers at a synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day, and during Shabbat, is horrific. We stand with our Israeli friends.\" . President Joe Biden talked to Mr Netanyahu and offered all \"appropriate means of support\", the White House said.. Shortly after the incident, Mr Netanyahu visited the site, as did Mr Ben-Gvir.. The controversial national security minister promised to bring safety back to Israel's streets, but there is rising anger that he has not yet done so, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem said. . United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \"deeply worried about the current escalation of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory\", a spokesperson said.. \"This is the moment to exercise utmost restraint,\" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.. On Saturday, the European Union expressed alarm at heightened tensions and urged Israel to use lethal force only as a last resort. . \"The European Union fully recognises Israel's legitimate security concerns - as evidenced by the latest terrorist attacks - but it has to be stressed that lethal force must only be used as a last resort when it is strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,\" said the EU's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell.. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of the international community.. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the future capital of a hoped-for independent state.. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.
