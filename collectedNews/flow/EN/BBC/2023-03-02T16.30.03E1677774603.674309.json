        "content": "Mr Kishida's party is under growing pressure to improve LGBTQ rights, as more Japanese support same-sex marriage.. Japan remains the only G7 country that doesn't recognise such unions. . When asked by an opposition lawmaker if the country's existing law constituted discrimination, the PM said on Tuesday: \"I don't think disallowing same-sex couples to marry is unjust discrimination by the state.\". The prime minister also reiterated his position on Wednesday that a ban on same-sex marriage is \"not unconstitutional\" but said his stand should not be seen as a form of discrimination.. Local LGBTQ groups have accused Mr Kishida of backpedalling on commitments made in recent weeks - saying his words contradicted his actions.. He held a meeting with LGBTQ activists last month after .  who said he didn't \"even want to look at\" sexual minorities. He appointed a special aide for LGBTQ issues and also said his party would consider a new bill. . The activists also said it was inaccurate for Mr Kishida to state that same-sex marriage was \"not unconstitutional\" in Japan, when local courts have ruled otherwise in at least two precedent-setting decisions.. The public attitude towards same-sex marriage has changed, especially among younger voters, said the Marriage for Equality Japan (MFEJ) group. A recent poll shows two-thirds of voters support making same-sex marriage legal.. \"I think this is one of the reason why the government is estranged from public opinion, as the most in the heart of the government are elderly men,\" said MFEJ chairperson Makiko Terahara.. Some couples have challenged the ban before the courts, to varying results. . In November 2022, .  but said the denial of legal protections to same-sex couples was discriminatory. Rights campaigners hailed the ruling as a win for raising the need to amend current laws.. The country is also under pressure from its G7 peers to recognise LGBTQ rights as the country prepares to host the bloc's next meeting in May.. There has been improvement in LGBTQ rights in Asia, but Taiwan remains the only territory that recognises same-sex marriage in the region. . ",

        "content": "About 300 black residents of Greenwood - a prosperous town then known as \"Black Wall Street\" - were murdered and their homes and businesses destroyed by a mob of white people.. The citizenship ceremony took place at Ghana's embassy in Washington DC. . Ms Fletcher, known as Mother Fletcher, and Mr Van Ellis, also called Uncle Red, visited Ghana in August 2021 as part of a week-long tour of Africa to mark the centenary of the killings, known as the Tulsa race massacre. . The pair will become dual citizens, the Washington Post reports, citing comments made at the ceremony by Hajia Alima Mahama, Ghana's US ambassador.. The Justice for Greenwood Foundation, which works with survivors of the massacre and their descendants, said the pair have become the oldest African-Americans to be granted citizenship of Ghana. . The foundation said it was \"proud to stand in solidarity with the survivors, celebrating their resilience and their contribution to the history\" of black Oklahoma. . Rocky Dawuni, a Ghanaian singer-songwriter, posed with a photo of Ms Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis at the citizenship ceremony, calling it a \"historic day\". . During their 2021 visit, Ms Fletcher and Mr Van Ellis were both granted royal Ghanaian names, and met President Nana Akufo-Addo, who had invited members of the African diaspora to visit Ghana . , commemorating 400 years since the first African slaves were said to have arrived in the US. . \"This country is your country, and anyone who wants to come to re-establish, connect with us here, is welcome,\" Mr Akufo-Addo said in 2021. . Ghana was a key transit point for transporting slaves and the president said his country felt a responsibility to welcome all those who could trace their ancestry to Africa. The initiative was also aimed at boosting Ghana's economy, particularly tourism, as well as its international image.. The country attracted a number of celebrities in 2019, including model Naomi Campbell, actor Idris Elba, comedian Steve Harvey and American rapper Cardi B.. This video can not be played. In 1921 Tulsa saw one of the biggest race massacres in American history.. More than 100 years after it took place, the Tulsa massacre remains one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history.. Against a backdrop of racial segregation, Ku Klux Klan rallies and lynchings, on 31 May 1921 armed white mobs went on the rampage in the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood after a black man was accused of assaulting a white woman. . An estimated 300 black people were killed, and the Greenwood district devastated beyond recognition.. For decades the story of the massacre was largely erased from history, but was thrust into the spotlight in 2020 when then-President Donald Trump announced he would hold an election rally in Tulsa on 19 June. The day is celebrated by many African-Americans as Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery. . Occurring in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, which triggered nationwide protests about racial injustice, Mr Trump moved his rally to a day later.. ",

        "content": "The walkout follows protests in Athens, Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa, near the site of the disaster.. Rescue workers are still going through burned and buckled carriages, searching for victims.. This was the \"most difficult moment\", rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters news agency, as \"instead of saving lives, we have to recover bodies\".. The incident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. A passenger train carrying 350 people collided with a freight train after both ended up on the same track - causing the front carriages to burst into flames.. The railway workers' strike began at 0600 local time (0400 GMT), affecting national rail services and the subway in Athens. . Many in Greece see the crash as an accident waiting to happen, and the union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on a technical fault.. The country's transport minister has resigned over the incident, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system that was not fit for the 21st Century.. Meanwhile, the government has promised an independent investigation that it promises will deliver justice.. But Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's suggestion that \"tragic human error\" was to blame has caused anger. . On Wednesday, rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the headquarters of the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters, who threw stones and lit fires in the streets. . At a silent vigil in Larissa to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had been long coming.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. \"This is an inadmissible accident. We've known this situation for 30 years,\" a doctor based in Larissa, Costas Bargiotas, told AFP.. This video can not be played. Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. Many of the passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage - which burst into flames - had reached 1,300C (2,370F), making it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\".. Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday.. Kostas Malizos, a recently retired surgeon and Emeritus Professor at Greece's University of Thessaly, has returned to work to perform surgery on injured passengers.. \"Now we're in the phase of trying to match the human parts that were found at the site of the crash and match it with DNA,\" he told the BBC. . Local media have reported that more than 10 people are still missing, as Greece observes three days of national mourning.. But Professor Malizos has said it is difficult to tell how many people are unaccounted for. . He also questioned how the prime minister could have reached such a quick a conclusion that human error was to blame and said an extensive independent investigation was essential.  . \"It's a disaster, it's catastrophic. Families are crying tonight. Unfortunately, the majority of the lost people are young students. They left home, happy after the long weekend, to go for their studies or to see their relatives and never reached them.\".
