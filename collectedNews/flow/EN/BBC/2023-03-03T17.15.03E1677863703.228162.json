The Australian Defence Force is in the region helping to evacuate people.. Mr Paech said some 700 people, including 35 with medical needs, had been flown out of Kalkarindji, about 770km (478 miles) south of Darwin, after the Victoria River burst its banks.. \"Defence Australia has given us three big planes - two C130s and one C27 - and they're working to fly evacuees to Katherine,\" he tweeted, referring to a town in the NT.. A spokeswoman for Mr Paech said major floods brought added risks from crocodiles. . \"When the river bursts its banks, they're everywhere\", she told the BBC. . Evacuated people will be housed at a former Covid quarantine facility, Howard Springs, and children will be able to attend local schools, officials said.. The territory declared an emergency for four remote areas this week as the upper Victoria River reached major flood levels.. Emergency Controller Daniel Bacon said roads to a number of remote communities remained cut off and urged people to stay away. . \"We continue to remind everyone that if it's flooded; forget it.\"     . The Bureau of Meteorology said the Victoria River had reached a height of 14m at Kalkarindji, but was now falling. . ",

        "content": "Not enough of the new notes were released, leading to widespread anger and frustration.. Many people were unable to get cash to pay for food and slept outside banks.. The policy was announced last October and the new notes were released in mid-December. People were initially given until the end of January to hand in all their old notes, although this had previously been extended amid the chaotic scenes.. Reading out the ruling, Justice Emmanuel Agim said the correct process had not been followed.. \"The directive given by President is invalid. Such directive is not just handed down after personal conversation with the governor of CBN [Central Bank of Nigeria],\" he said.. The court also berated President Muhammadu Buhari for not obeying a previous provisional order to halt the policy until it decided the case. It said there was nothing to show that President Buhari's directive for the release of old 200 naira notes until 10 April was implemented.. \"Disobedience of order of court shows the country's democracy [is] a mere pretension and now replaced by autocracy,\" it said in a scathing verdict.. Nigerians are still experiencing difficulties accessing cash at banks and cash machines and it is not clear what immediate impact the reversal will have.. Many had already deposited their old notes at the banks and with the new ones unavailable, large numbers have switched to online banking.. However, millions of people and businesses in the rural areas remain heavily dependent on cash.. Sixteen Nigerian states had challenged the redesign of the 200, 500, and 1,000 naira notes, saying that the deadline was too tight.. The central bank said that the redesign would help bring down inflation, control the amount of money in circulation and make ransom payments in Nigeria's huge kidnap industry more difficult. Many suspected that the policy was also targeted at politicians involved in vote-buying during elections.. A tightly contested presidential election last Saturday was won by the ruling party. Some cases of vote-buying were reported, but fewer than in previous polls.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Police held hostage in Colombia protest. Violence erupted on Thursday after residents blockaded the compound of the oil exploration company Emerald Energy.. They were demanding its help to repair and build new roads in the area.. A civilian was also killed and nine oilfield workers captured alongside the police officers. Video showed the hostages sitting in a crowded room on rows of chairs and on the floor.. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he hoped they would be \"unilaterally\" released before any escalation of violence, and asked for medical help from the Red Cross.. Many of the protesters are rural and indigenous people who want Emerald Energy to build new road infrastructure around the San Vicente del Caguan area.. The oil company did not respond when approached by Reuters news agency for comment.. Colombian police paid tribute on Twitter to the police officer killed in the clash, who they named as Ricardo Monroy.. \"Today we are more united than ever,\" they wrote, adding that Mr Monroy had \"offered his life in the line of duty\".. Local government officials said the officer died from a machete attack, while the civilian was killed by gunfire.. Colombia's human rights ombudsman Carlos Camargo - who was on site to mediate - said he had spoken with protesters and stopped them from firing Molotov cocktails at the oil facility.. Protests in areas near energy and mining operations in Colombia are common as communities demand companies build infrastructure, including roads and schools.. Police said a dissident subgroup of Farc rebels which rejected the 2016 peace deal were present in the region and may have been provoking the unrest.. Separately, Mr Petro on Thursday unexpectedly published a statement on Twitter asking the country's prosecutor general to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption involving his own son and brother.. The statement did not specify the accusations against his eldest son, Nicolas Petro Burgos, and brother, Juan Fernando Petro Urrego, but it did say: \"my government will not give out benefits to criminals in exchange for bribes\". .

Mr Bialiatski was one of three winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.. He was arrested in 2021 following .  the previous year, and accused of smuggling cash into Belarus to fund opposition activity.. Demonstrators were met with police brutality and Lukashenko critics .  during the demonstrations, which started in 2020.. Mr Bialiatski was in court alongside two fellow campaigners, Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich. . Mr Stefanovich was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Mr Labkovich received seven years, according to Viasna, the group Mr Bialiatski founded in 1996. . All three had pleaded not guilty. . Mr Bialiatski's wife, Natalya Pinchuk, said the trial was \"obviously against human rights defenders for their human rights work\", describing it as a \"cruel\" verdict. . Referring to her husband's letters from prison, where he has been held since arrest, she said: \"He always writes that everything is fine. He doesn't complain about his health - he tries not to upset me.\" . Kostya Staradubets, a spokesperson for Viasna, said the sentences imposed on the three activists were \"breaking our hearts\". . Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, he said: \"We knew that our three colleagues would get long prison terms but anyway it's still a shock, it's breaking our hearts, not only the [prison] terms are long but the conditions also very horrific.. \"We call [the conditions] torture actually because they're being held for several months in a 19th Century building, poorly lit cells with no fresh air, no sunlight, poor food, little or no healthcare.\" . Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said the sentencing was \"simply appalling\". . \"We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice and free them,\" she said. . Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize, said the verdict was a \"tragedy\" for Mr Bialiatski and described the charges as \"politically motivated\".. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned what he described as \"sham trials\", adding they were \"yet another appalling example of the Lukashenko regime trying to silence those who stand up in defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people in Belarus\". . There are currently 1,458 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna. Authorities claim there are none. . In awarding the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to Mr Bialiatski, Ms Reiss-Anderson said the Belarusian government had \"for years tried to silence him\". . \"He has been harassed, he has been arrested and jailed, and he has been deprived of employment,\" she said. . Mr Bialiatski is a veteran of the human rights movement in Belarus, establishing Viasna in 1996 in response to the brutal crackdown of street protests that year by Mr Lukashenko, who has been president of Belarus since the office was established in 1994. . He was jailed for three years in 2011 after being convicted on tax evasion charges, which he denied. . This video can not be played.

Mr Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been described as Europe's last dictator. . Increasingly reliant on Moscow for economic, political and military support, he has hosted Russian forces and allowed them to use Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion of Ukraine.. , as well as for political oppression at home..
