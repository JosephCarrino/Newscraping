        "content": "The US says the drone was on a routine mission in international airspace when two Russian jets tried to intercept it.. Russia said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and denied that the two aircraft made direct contact. . The Russian defence ministry also said the MQ-9 Reaper drone was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.. Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. . The incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday, according to the US military. . This video can not be played. Watch: Pentagon calls Russia's move 'unsafe, unprofessional'. \"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,\" the statement said. . Several times before the collision the Su-27 fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said. . The US summoned the Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, to protest against the move.. Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The key question is whether Tuesday's encounter was an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work, or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . So this could simply have been a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. This video can not be played. Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "They are being investigated on charges of rape, people trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Both have denied wrongdoing. . Mr Tate's spokeswoman said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that his legal team would appeal.. Lawyers for Mr Tate have long argued that keeping him in preventative custody is unnecessarily harsh, when other judicial options - such as house arrest - are available.. Judges have so far disagreed, based on the perceived risk of Mr Tate fleeing the country, influencing witnesses or evidence, or that his release would disturb public order.. The request for bail in place of custody was new, but the response from the court, the same.. In late February, the court ruled that Mr Tate should remain in custody until 29 March. . On Wednesday, Mr Tate's brother Tristan will also apply for bail in a separate hearing. . Last month, an appeals court overturned all but one of the justifications for keeping Tristan Tate in detention.. No charges have yet been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.. In 2016, Mr Tate, a former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. ",

        "content": "The United States' National Security Council's (NSC) John Kirby says there have been other intercepts \"even in recent weeks\", but that this one was different.. Could it have been an accident? . \"Based on the actions of the Russian pilots, it's clear that it was unsafe, unprofessional,\" was the verdict of the Pentagon's Press Secretary, Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder. . \"I think the actions speak for themselves.\". Does the behaviour of Russia's pilots - allegedly dumping fuel in the path of the drone and then colliding with it - represent a significant escalation? . This video can not be played. Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?. According to the Pentagon, the whole incident lasted about 30-40 minutes.. During that time, Gen Ryder said there was no direct communication between the Russian and American militaries. . US officials say they believe the Russian Su-27 jets involved \"likely\" suffered some damage, indicating that a collision was not deliberate.. \"I do know that the state department is raising our concerns about the incident directly with the Russian government,\" he added.. What, if anything, does the episode mean for the future of American drone operations over the Black Sea, and for the vital surveillance such operations provide to Ukraine? . \"If the message is that they want to deter or dissuade us from flying or operating in international airspace over the Black Sea,\" Mr Kirby told broadcaster VOA, \"then that message will fail because that is not going to happen\".. Not surprisingly, Russia would like to make it as hard as possible for Ukraine's allies to carry out such work. . Washington is being tight lipped about what has happened to the drone. . After the collision, US remote pilots were forced to bring it down in the Black Sea.. Gen Ryder would not say where it landed or whether the Russian navy was trying to recover it. . Audio recordings circulating on social media seem to indicate some kind of Russian recovery operation was under way. But this has not been confirmed. . Clearly, Washington would not be happy if such sensitive surveillance technology fell into Russian hands.. For Joe Biden, determined to support Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\", this is a delicate moment.. It's not just Western weaponry that's helping Ukraine to withstand Russia's invasion. . It's also a vast quantity of real-time intelligence on every aspect of Russia's military operations, including the movement of vessels in the Black Sea and the launch of missiles aimed at targets across Ukraine. . From defending Ukraine's critical national infrastructure to planning its own offensive operations, Kyiv depends heavily on the steady flow of information. . For obvious reasons, US officials won't be drawn into what, if any, additional precautions its surveillance operations will now involve.. Washington wants to keep them going, but is anxious to avoid using force, and risk getting drawn into a more direct confrontation with Moscow. . ",

        "content": "Providing help can now fetch up to three years in prison in Poland.. The woman Ms Wydrzynska sent the pills to did not end up having an abortion.. UN officials, gynaecologists and human rights groups had all appealed for the case to be dropped.. Ms Wydrzynska, who will appeal against the verdict, told the court she had sent a package of abortion pills to the pregnant woman when she found out that she was in an abusive relationship.. The woman involved, named as Ania which is not her real name, had planned to travel to a clinic in Germany to terminate her pregnancy, but was unable to travel when a Covid-19 lockdown was imposed. She then sought help online.. Ms Wydrzynska, who works with Abortion Dream Team, said she had decided to send Ania the pills to give her a choice. She had herself suffered abuse from the father of her children and had kept her own abortion a secret. . When Ania's partner found out about the pills he confiscated them and reported the activist to police. She never had the baby but subsequently had a miscarriage, according to reports.. Addressing the court, Ms Wydrzynska said she was innocent and that the state had failed her, Ania and other women, Polish website Oko.press reported: \"I was driven by the desire to help, when no-one else wanted to or could help.\". Protesters gathered outside the court in Warsaw holding .  (I am Justyna) banners and Amnesty International condemned the sentence as a \"depressing low in the repression of reproductive rights in Poland\".. Since 2020, abortion in Poland has been allowed only in cases of rape or incest or when the pregnancy endangers the health of the mother. Only Malta has stricter abortion laws in the European Union and the decision led to widespread protests in Poland.. Activists and women's rights groups say the 2020 court ruling has had a chilling effect on doctors who now fear repercussions even when there are legal grounds for an abortion.. When a pregnant woman died in a Polish hospital in 2021, her family said the laws stopped doctors from intervening and the government had to update the guidelines. Izabela, 30, died of septic shock as doctors are alleged to have waited for her unborn baby to die.. Although Ms Wydrzynska's lawyer had called for an acquittal, prosecutors had sought a longer term of community service. Ultra-orthodox Catholic legal group group Ordo Iuris which took part in the trial said she should receive a suspended jail term.. The verdict is thought to be the first time an activist, rather than a family member or doctor, has been put on trial for helping someone have an abortion in Poland. . Last year, the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics (Figo) wrote to public prosecutor general Zbigniew Ziobro calling on him to drop the charges and halt further \"reprisals\" against Ms Wydrzynska or other activists and fully decriminalise access to abortion..
