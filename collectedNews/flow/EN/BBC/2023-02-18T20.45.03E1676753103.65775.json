        "content": "Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities \"will be held to account\". Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of \"gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation\" since its invasion.. World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. . UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. . The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. . Ms Harris told the conference that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. . \"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,\" she said. . The UN defines crimes against humanity as a \"widespread or systemic attack\" on a particular civilian population.. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. . \"In the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity,\" Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, told the conference. . She cited \"barbaric and inhumane\" atrocities during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found .  shortly after the invasion and the . \"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,\" Ms Harris said.. This video can not be played. Evidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha. Crimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).. But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.. Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.. The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had \"waged a genocidal war\" because it did not think Ukrainians \"deserve to exist as a sovereign nation\".. Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.. This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It's a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. . Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. . But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. . Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. . It's opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. . There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia's invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "UK PM Rishi Sunak: \"Now is the moment to double down on our military support (for Ukraine)\". Mr Sunak told the Munich Security Conference that allies must give the country \"advanced, Nato-standard capabilities\".. He said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. Throughout the conference, Ukraine's allies have reiterated the case for defending the country. . The three-day gathering to discuss global security, taking place in Germany ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion, provided a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives. . Ukraine's allies tried to demonstrate their resolve and tried to convince the Russian government that they will not give up or give in, even if the cost in \"blood and treasure\" increases in coming months.. Most of those who attended the conference - from heads of state and ministers to diplomats and spies - were from Europe or the US, including . and nearly 30 European heads of government. No Russian officials were invited. . Mr Sunak had said he wanted to \"make sure other countries follow our lead\" in providing battle tanks, and training soldiers and aviators on Nato-standard aircrafts.. In his speech in Germany, he said: \"Ukraine needs more artillery, armoured vehicles and air defences, so now is the time to double down on our military support.. \"When Putin started this war, he gambled that our resolve would falter. Even now he is betting we will lose our nerve.. \"But we proved him wrong then, and we will prove him wrong now.\". Calling for a new Nato charter to provide assurances of long-term support, Mr Sunak said allies \"must demonstrate that we'll remain by their side, willing and able to help them defend their country again and again\".. He went on to say that, as well as having a military strategy \"to gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield\", allies also needed \"to rebuild the international order on which our collective security depends\".. Mr Sunak said international law needed to be upheld in order to hold Russia to account. He also called for \"a new framework\" for Ukraine's long-term security, and said the international community's response had not been strong enough against Russia's aggression.. Before his speech, Mr Sunak met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and both agreed on the need to sustain \"the record level of international support for Ukraine\", a Downing Street spokeswoman said. . Mr Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also agreed on \"the importance of giving Ukraine the military momentum they need to secure victory against tyranny\" in a meeting on the conference sidelines, said No 10.. The unspoken question in Munich was what will happen if the participants meet this time next year and the war is still going on.. Of particular concern was whether the political and economic costs of the war could prove too much to bear, as the Russian leadership assumes, or the western alliance will stand firm behind Ukraine.. The uncertainty around these issues is another reason why allies want to step up support now, to ensure Ukraine can see off any Russian offensive and launch a counter-attack on its own. President Volodymyr Zelensky is not the only one urging speed.. Last week, the Ukrainian leader visited the UK, as well as Paris and Brussels, where he appealed for European leaders to supply his country with modern fighter jets.. The UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard jets and Mr Sunak has said \"nothing is off the table\". . But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said . . . He told the BBC it could take months to train pilots and the UK was instead focused on using alternative provision of air cover to Ukraine. . Some Nato member countries are also worried that giving jets to Ukraine would be viewed as escalating the war, risking direct confrontation between the Western military alliance and Russia. . Since Russia invaded on 24 February last year, the UK has spent £2.3bn on military assistance, making the country the second biggest donor behind the US. The government has said it plans to match this spending again this year.. Military equipment provided by the UK so far includes tanks, air defence systems and artillery. . However, Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated by the time Western weapons have taken to arrive. Deliveries of battle tanks - promised last month by countries including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. During Mr Sunak's meeting with Ms Von der Leyen, the pair also had what Downing Street described as a \"positive discussion\" about fixing issues with . . . They agreed there had been \"very good progress to find solutions\" but that \"intensive work in the coming days is still needed\" to get a deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements over the line, according to No 10. . It comes after sources suggested that a deal could be reached between the UK and the European Union . , after more than a year of negotiations.. .. Use this form to ask your question: .

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they had tickets to the event, but the invite was withdrawn based on advice from UK police.. The ban was down to \"concerns about public safety and security,\" he was told, but was given no more information on what those risks were.. Mr Grozev added, however, that in recent weeks he has received \"numerous alerts from different law enforcement agencies around Europe that there is credible evidence that my life is in danger\".. The Metropolitan Police said .  that threats by foreign states to journalists in the UK are \"a reality that we are absolutely concerned with\"..

An armed police presence was stationed near the channel's studios in Chiswick, west London, and concrete barriers were placed outside the building. . London's Metropolitan Police said 15 plots had been foiled since the start of 2022 to either kidnap or kill UK-based individuals perceived as enemies of the Iranian regime.. \"I cannot believe it has come to this,\" said the network's general manager, Mahmood Enayat.. \"A foreign state has caused such a significant threat to the British public on British soil that we have to move,\" he said.. \"Let's be clear, this is not just a threat to our TV station, but the British public at large.\".

Iran International has been one of the most prominent providers of news on the recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran. . Protests swept across the country in September following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.. In October, the Iranian government announced sanctions against Iran International and BBC News Persian, accusing them of \"incitement of riots\" and \"support of terrorism\" over their coverage of the anti-government protests that have engulfed the country over the past two months.. The two UK-based channels are already banned from Iran, but a press freedom watchdog says they are among the main sources of news and information in a country where independent media and journalists are constantly persecuted.. In November, Iran's Intelligence Minister, Esmail Khatib, said Iran International had been identified by Tehran as a \"terrorist\" organisation, that all co-operation and links with it would be considered a threat against national security, and that its \"agents\" would be pursued, state news agency Irna reported.. He also accused the UK of spreading propaganda against Iran's clerical establishment and warned it would \"pay for its measures to create insecurity\".. ",

        "content": "The letter threatened to sue the woman and her parents for $300m (£249m) if she did not retract her statements.. A lawyer for the Tates said they were pursuing valid claims for defamation.. The BBC has seen a redacted copy of the letter, apparently sent on behalf of the brothers.. \"In April 2022,\" it reads, \"you falsely stated to a third party that our Client human trafficked you, abused you and held you against your will […] You have repeated false and defamatory statements to the police, the media, and another United States citizen about the Tate brothers.\". Andrew and Tristan Tate are currently being held in preventative custody in Romania, while police investigate allegations of trafficking and rape, which both men deny.. Benjamin Bull - who works for the National Centre on Sexual Exploitation - says his client is a key witness in the Romanian investigation, and that the letter was designed to do \"one thing and one thing only\":. \"[It] was intended to shut down the witness; stop the witness from bringing testimony forward in any proceedings,\" he said. . \"They want these young ladies to climb into a hole and hide, never come forward [or] describe what they saw and what happened to them. It's clearly an effort to intimidate.\". Lawyers for the Tates have confirmed to the BBC that the cease-and-desist letter was sent in December, as a civil matter for defamation and slander in the US, but deny any intimidation.. Tina Glandian, one of their legal advisors, said there was nothing abnormal in them pursuing valid legal claims for defamation. \"The fact that [the Tates] are incarcerated right now is not a basis for them not to pursue their legal rights,\" she said.. The investigation into rape and trafficking allegations is believed to rest, at least partly, on the testimony of six women.  No charges have yet been brought.. The Tates' legal team have also revealed that the brothers filed criminal complaints in Romania last April against two women, including the witness who received the cease-and-desist letter in December.. Ms Glandian said the criminal complaints in April were filed in response to allegations that two women were being held against their will by the Tate brothers. . \"There was no evidence whatsoever of that,\" she said, \"which is why [the Tates] were not arrested in April.  [At that time], they were nothing but victims of false allegations, and they had every right to file criminal complaints for having their homes raided [and] property seized.\". The results of those criminal complaints are still pending, she says.. Benjamin Bull, who represents some of the witnesses in the current Tate investigation, says the impact of legal action on his clients has been upsetting and intimidating.. But Dani Pinter, part of the same legal team, says it is not just the threat of legal action that is intimidating, but the online harassment many of her clients receive for speaking out.. \"Regular, high production value videos, meant to embarrass and harass them, are shared among Tate's followers,\" she told me. . \"Making really salacious claims, attempting to slut shame them, saying they're liars. But included in that is their private information - where they work, who their family members are - with the clear intention to incite harassment.  And it's working.\". The two alleged victims she represents have been getting death threats, she says. . \"They're scared to death. They're both in hiding. They feel they can't settle anywhere, because people are trying to find them.\". Prosecutors have been careful to keep the names of the six women in their case strictly confidential. But some have had their full names published on social media. . And the names of two witnesses even appeared in a statement to the BBC from the Tates' US communications team. The BBC is not naming them publicly.. Andrew Tate and his brother have no access to their social media while in custody, but they've built a vast and loyal network of fans and supporters who are very active online.. Some accounts appear to be fully-staffed operations, regularly releasing videos and documents designed to undermine the testimony of witnesses and other women making allegations against the Tates.. Earlier this week, one of the most active accounts published the full name, social media handles and WhatsApp messages of one of the alleged victims in the investigation.. The BBC has approached the account for comment, but has not yet received a response.. Even those who barely break the surface of this story can find themselves a target.. Daria Gusa spoke to the BBC and others about receiving a private message from Andrew Tate's Instagram account when she was 16 years old.  It followed the same pattern laid out by him in online speeches about how to win a woman's attention and gain influence over her.. She did not allege that he had committed any crime.. \"I got a bunch of messages,\" she told me. \"Most were from people saying I was lying or calling me a slut.\". But she also received \"10 to 15 threats\" online.. \"I had a guy texting me, telling me 'I know you're studying at this university, the schedule is published online, I know where you are'\" Daria said.. Several of her friends, who also appear to have had contact with him, have refused to speak out about their experiences, she says.. \"It's not just the people who work for him,\" she explained. \"It's that there are basically millions of men out there who really idolise these people, and would do anything to protect them and their image, so I think it's completely justifiable that so many girls don't want to speak out.\". It is not clear exactly who runs some of the most active accounts defending the Tates, or how much cooperation exists between them.. But the risks for women making public allegations against Andrew Tate can be high, and they can come from many directions.. ",
