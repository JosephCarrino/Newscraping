        "content": "Until Thursday, Ukraine had just gone for more than three weeks in a row with no blackouts and even had surplus in the system. . There had been no Russian attacks for three weeks either, and it looked as if Vladimir Putin's battle to bring down Ukraine's supply was over.. \"Yes, we're doing it, but who started it?\" he said in December, pinning the blame on Kyiv.. It was a far more desperate story at that point. As much as half the energy infrastructure was damaged and a Ukrainian nuclear security expert warned the situation was close to critical.. But during those weeks of quiet, Russia was stocking up weaponry. In the early hours of Thursday it fired 81 missiles and left four regions grappling with emergency power cuts. By Friday, half a million people still had no power in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city.. \"It's totally cold now. We have food, but only part of it has been cooked,\" said Oleksii as he watched the battery life on his mobile phone slip to 14%.  . Five hundred people live in his block of flats, and when he went to his local \"invincibility centre\" to power up his phone, there were too many people with the same idea.. Kyiv was also hit and one hospital treating 700 people went without heating and hot water for several hours. . Another 150,000 people were left with no power in Zhytomyr, two hours' drive south of the Belarus border. The mayor said the next few weeks would be critical and rolling blackouts are looming for this city west of Kyiv.. But, as resident Eugene Herasymchuk wrapped up his day at work on a sunny spring day, he was confident for the future.. \"We had three weeks without attacks and we had power. And the power in the system allowed local authorities to start up the trolleybuses and trams. That was a big step because before that public transport was on a pause.\". And for many Ukrainians, it was not long before they were back on the grid.. \"It's safe to say that Ukraine won on the energy front,\" said Tetyana Boyko from civic network Opora, praising the fleet of energy workers and international help. \"Let's pray, but I think the worst-case scenario is over.\". The winter may be over, but Oleksii in Kharkiv believes the battle to save Ukraine's power supply from Vladimir Putin's missiles will continue as long as Russia has the ability to strike it. . Every one of Ukraine's thermal and hydroelectric power plants has been damaged since Russia launched its assault on the energy infrastructure last October. Kyiv had already lost the use of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, which is in Russia hands.. Sub-stations have been reduced to hunks of twisted metal, no longer capable of transforming the electricity to power for homes and businesses.. For two weeks in the depth of winter, the BBC followed teams of engineers and technicians rushing to repair the damage that the missiles had done.. One substation was hit six times with missiles or drones and replacing these damaged transformers will take time.. Transformers have quickly become Ukraine's number one requirement. It needs more than the world can produce in a year and so far only one high-voltage transformer has been sent, although dozens of lower-power machines have arrived.. As the winter wore on, Ukraine's armed forces grew more adept at shooting down Russia's missiles and drones. . But this week, only 34 of the missiles were destroyed, because Russia used different, high-speed weapons. They included hypersonic Kh-47 Kinzhal missiles as well as anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.. \"They can cause huge, huge destruction,\" said one industry official. . Until Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine began in February 2022, there were 15 nuclear reactors on stream at four power stations. Six of those reactors were at Zaporizhzhia, seized by the occupying military in the early days of the invasion.. For months, the plant has been at the centre of a high-stakes nuclear row, amid accusations that Moscow wants to connect it to Russia's electricity grid.. The other three power stations are South Ukraine and Rivne and Khmelnytskyi in the west. Between them, they now produce half of Ukraine's power.. That may sound bleak, but a combination of an unusually mild winter and sheer hard work means Ukraine has moved back from the brink and the sense of optimism is palpable.. Power plants have been restored and repaired. One source in the industry told the BBC that as the days became sunnier and warmer, it would become harder and harder for Russia's military might to terrorise his country.. The east-central city of Dnipro has endured several deadly missile strikes over the winter, and this week was no different.  . But there have been no problems for weeks with energy supplies.. \"The city has transformed. Finally, street lights are back, and it's no longer scary to walk the city streets,\" said Inna Shtanko, a young mother with a son under the age of two.. Cooking and having a hot shower have become part of the daily routine once more for her family. \"Our psychological state has improved considerably, because our family and other mothers too can easily plan our day.\". There's a similar story in Kherson, occupied by Russian forces until they retreated across the Dnipro river last November.. Life was hard for several weeks after the Russians left the southern city with no basic utilities. . \"We didn't have any electricity for about month and a week, then we had it for two hours a day, then gradually it stopped breaking,\" said local entrepreneur Alexei Sandakov. . Now he boasts a regular power supply, although the pressure on the system is far lower than before the war because the population of 55,000 is a fraction of what it was before the Russians invaded. . Population numbers have fallen across Ukraine, with more than eight million refugees beyond its borders, and that too has put less strain on the energy infrastructure. Consumption is down and the refugees have not yet come back, as one official remarked.. The overall sense is that the damage caused by this latest wave of missiles will be repaired quickly. . The damage was considerable, but engineers have become highly skilled at restoring power within days, even after a major attack.. \"It's like a competition: how quickly can they cause us damage and how quickly can we repair. And we are winning that competition,\" said Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of Kyiv's Energy Industry Research Centre.. In Zhytomyr, Eugene Herasymchuk believes things are looking up. \"A lot of Ukrainians say it's better to have one cold and one dark winter than 100 years with Russia - so I think we can handle this.\". Ukrainians now have everything on their side, according to Mr Kharchenko, from the improving weather to the support of international donors and the professional staff in the energy industry. But he is more guarded about the future.. \"I don't say we've won the energy war, but I can say we won the energy battle this winter.\". ",

        "content": "Watch: Video appears to show Hamburg suspect firing weapon. He co-operated with officers and there were not enough grounds to take away his gun at the time, police said.. The 35-year-old suspect, named only as Philipp F, had a licence to own the weapon for sporting purposes.. The country is preparing a new law involving tighter curbs on gun ownership, the interior minister said.. Seven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in Thursday's attack which unfolded at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the city.. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) to report that shots had been fired, and officers were on site four minutes later.. Video appeared to show the gunman firing through a window. He then stormed the building where dozens of people had gathered, firing nine magazines of ammunition before apparently turning the gun on himself after police arrived.. Eight people were injured, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. She survived but her unborn baby was killed. . Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the death toll could rise.. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers saved many lives. He described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history.. Officials said the suspect had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member before leaving \"on bad terms\". . Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century.. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members.. On Friday, Hamburg Police Chief Ralf Martin Meyer said officers visited the man in February after they received an anonymous letter claiming he \"bore particular anger toward religious believers, in particular toward Jehovah's Witnesses\".. The letter also said he \"might be suffering from a mental illness, although it had not been medically diagnosed\". . Police said he was co-operative and had an open conversation with the officers. \"The bottom line is that an anonymous tip in which someone says they're worried a person might have a psychological illness, isn't in itself a basis for [such] measures,\" Chief Meyer said.. Forensic experts worked at the scene of the shooting on Deelböge street through the night but have since left the area. . Mourners have left floral tributes near to the front door. One man, holding his little boy and girl by the hand, told the BBC he tried to come home last night but his way was blocked by police wielding assault rifles.. Germany already has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a licence.. In 2021, there were about one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters.. After mass arrests were made last December . , the German authorities have been under pressure to tighten the country's gun laws even further.. ",

        "content": "Its troubles prompted a rush of customer withdrawals and sparked fears about the state of the banking sector.. Officials said they acted to \"protect insured depositors\".. Silicon Valley Bank faced \"inadequate liquidity and insolvency\", banking regulators in California, where the firm has its headquarters, said as they . .. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which typically protects deposits up to $250,000, .  it had taken charge of the roughly $175bn (£145bn) in deposits held at the bank, the 16th largest in the US. . Bank offices would reopen and clients with insured deposits would have access to funds \"no later than Monday morning\", it said, adding that money raised from selling the bank's assets would go to uninsured depositors.. With many of the firm's customers in that position, the situation has left many companies with money tied up at the bank worried about their future. . \"I'm on my way to the branch to find my money right now. Tried to transfer it out yesterday didn't work. You know those moments where you might be really screwed but you're not sure? This is one of those moments,\" one start-up founder told the BBC.. Another founder of a healthcare start-up said: \"Literally three days ago, we just hit a million dollars in our bank account... And then this happens.\". He managed to get the money wired to a different account 40 minutes before the deadline. \"It was pending. And then this morning, it was there. But I know other people who did the same thing minutes after me, and it's not transferred.\". \"It was a crazy situation,\" he said.. The collapse came after SVB said it was trying to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss caused by the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, which had been affected by higher interest rates.. The news caused investors and customers to flee the bank. Shares saw their biggest one-day drop on record on Thursday, plunging more than 60% and fell further in after-hours sales before trading was halted.. Concerns that other banks could face similar problems led to widespread selling of bank shares globally on Thursday and early Friday.. Speaking in Washington on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was monitoring \"recent developments\" at Silicon Valley Bank and others \"very carefully\".   . She later met with top banking regulators, where the Treasury Department said she expressed \"full confidence in banking regulators to take appropriate actions in response and noted that the banking system remains resilient\".. SVB did not respond to a request for comment.. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses, the company is the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It now employs more than 8,500 people globally, though most of its operations are in the US. . But the bank has been under pressure, as higher rates make it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales, and more clients withdrew deposits, moves that snowballed this week. . In Silicon Valley the reverberations from the collapse were widespread as companies faced questions about what the collapse meant for their finances. . Even businesses without direct business were affected, like customers of Rippling, a firm that handles payrolls software and had used SVB. It warned that current payments may face delays and said it was switching its business to another bank.  . SVB's UK subsidiary said it will be put into insolvency from Sunday evening. . The Bank of England said Silicon Valley Bank UK would stop making payments or accepting deposits in the interim and the move would allow individual depositors to be paid up to £85,000 from the UK's deposit insurance scheme. . \"SVBUK has a limited presence in the UK and no critical functions supporting the financial system,\" the BoE added.. As well as being a major blow to the tech industry, the collapse of SVB has raised concerns about the wider risks facing banks, as rapid increases in interest rates hit bond markets. . Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply raised borrowing costs over the last year as they try to curb inflation. . But as rates rise, the value of existing bond portfolios typically declines.. Those falls mean many banks are sitting on significant potential losses - though the change in value would not typically be a problem unless other pressures force the firms to sell the holdings. . Shares in some major US banks recovered on Friday, but the sell-off continued to hit smaller firms, forcing trading halts of names such as Signature Bank and others.  . The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day down 1.7%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4% and the Dow closed 1% lower.. Major European and Asian indexes also closed lower, with the FTSE 100 down 1.6%. . Alexander Yokum, equity research analyst at CFRA, said banks that specialise in single industries are seen as vulnerable to rapid withdrawals, like the one that hit SVB.. \"Silicon Valley Bank would not have lost money if they hadn't run out of cash to give back to their customers,\" he said. \"The issue was that people wanted money and they didn't have it - they had it invested and those investments were down.\". \"I know there's a lot of fear, but it's definitely company-specific,\" he said.. \"The average Joe should be fine,\" he added, but he said tech firms would likely find it even harder to raise money. \"It's not good,\" he said. .

Ms Herman, who managed a restaurant owned by Mr Woods before their relationship began, has filed two lawsuits in Martin County, Florida.. She is arguing that the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) she signed is invalid because of a new federal law that limits the enforceability of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment or abuse.
