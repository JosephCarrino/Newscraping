RowVaughn Wells previously told BBC News that it was the race of the victim - in this case her son - and not the race of the perpetrators that mattered.. \"It's not about the colour of the police officer. We don't care if it's black, white, pink, purple. What they did was wrong,\" she said.. \"And what they're doing to the black communities is wrong. We're not worried about the race of the police officer. We're worried about the conduct of the police officers.\". The fall-out from the violent arrest has had ripple effects throughout the city..

        "content": "France's Emmanuel Macron also said now was not the time for dialogue with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.. The event is an annual gathering of leaders, officials and diplomats; its focus this year is transatlantic. . US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are attending with a large congressional delegation, alongside almost 30 European heads of government. . At the conference, Mr Scholz said it was \"wise to prepare for a long war\" and show Russian President Vladimir Putin that Germany and its allies would not give up on Ukraine. . Ukrainian officials have said they are urgently in need of heavier weapons, and that sufficient battle tanks could help Kyiv's forces seize back territory from the Russians.. Germany - who in recent months came under growing pressure over its apparent hesitation to send weapons to Ukraine - . .. It also allowed other countries to send their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine - which was restricted until now under export regulations.. Mr Macron said the next few weeks would be decisive, adding allies needed to \"intensify our support\" for Ukraine to be able to launch a counter-offensive, so later the country could enter negotiations in a position of strength.. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to assembled leaders via video link, urged allies to speed up the supply of weapons, warning there was no alternative to victory over Moscow.. No Russian officials have been invited. . The agenda is broad - from China to climate change - but the conference will give Ukraine's allies a chance to assess Russia's invasion almost one year on. . There will be warm words of support for Kyiv. But there will also be questions about the extent and duration of Western resolve as economic pressures grow.. ",

        "content": "The BBC says it will continue to co-operate. It will respond to any direct communication from tax officials. . The allegations come amid a row in India over a BBC documentary.. On Friday India's Income Tax Department said it had carried out a \"survey\" at the Delhi and Mumbai offices of a \"prominent international Media Company\" involved in \"content in Hindi, English and various other Indian languages\".. It said income and profits disclosed by the organisation's units were \"not commensurate with the scale of operations in India\".. The findings \"indicate that tax has not been paid on certain remittances which have not been disclosed as income in India by the foreign entities of the group\", the statement added.. On Thursday, following a three-day search of its offices in India, the BBC said: \"We will continue to co-operate with the authorities and hope matters are resolved as soon as possible.\". The statement continued: \"We are supporting staff - some of whom have faced lengthy questioning or been required to stay overnight - and their welfare is our priority.. \"Our output is back to normal and we remain committed to serving our audiences in India and beyond.. \"The BBC is a trusted, independent media organisation and we stand by our colleagues and journalists who will continue to report without fear or favour.\". The BBC's documentary, India: The Modi Question, was broadcast on television only in the UK, but the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attempted to block people sharing it, describing it as \"hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage\" with a \"colonial mindset\"..
