        "content": "Watch: US official confirms downing of object over Alaska. Spokesman John Kirby said the unmanned object was \"the size of a small car\" and was over a sparsely populated area at the time.. President Joe Biden decided to shoot down the object, which was of unknown origin, Mr Kirby said.. It comes after the American military destroyed a Chinese balloon over US territorial waters last Saturday.. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Kirby explained that the object over Alaska was travelling at 40,000ft (12,000m) and posed a \"reasonable threat\" to civilian aircraft.. He said the object had fallen into US waters that are frozen, adding that its debris field was \"much, much smaller\" than the balloon shot down last week off the coast of South Carolina.. \"We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,\" Mr Kirby said.. The object was first spotted on Thursday night, though officials did not specify a time. . He said two fighter jets had approached the object and assessed there was nobody on board, and this information was available to Mr Biden when he made his decision.. \"We're going to remain vigilant about our airspace,\" Mr Kirby asserted. \"The president takes his obligations to protect our national security interests as paramount.\". Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that an F-22 jet, based out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, shot down the object - which was moving at an unknown speed - with a sidewinder missile at 13:45 EST (18:45 GMT).. Mr Ryder said a significant amount of debris had been recovered so far. It was being loaded on to vessels and taken to \"labs for subsequent analysis\", he added.. Officials have not yet determined whether the object, which was travelling north-east, was involved in surveillance, and Mr Kirby corrected a reporter who referred to it as a balloon.. He did not specify where exactly the object was shot down, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it had closed about 10 sq miles of US airspace airspace above Deadhorse, northern Alaska, before the F-22 fired.. No other objects of a threatening nature have been identified above the US at this time, according to the White House.. Mr Kirby said the object did not appear to have the manoeuvrable capability like the Chinese balloon and seemed to be \"virtually at the whim of the wind\".. Hours after the US shot down the balloon last Saturday, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called his Chinese counterpart via their special crisis line.. But Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe declined to pick up, according to the Pentagon.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\". . ",

        "content": "As we entered the damaged neighbourhoods, it was difficult to distinguish between the destruction caused by this country's 12-year long civil war, and the devastation caused by the earthquake.. We saw residents waiting around in the cold squares surrounded by debris, many wrapped in blankets and coats. . In the eastern neighbourhood of al-Shaar, the sound of diggers rang out against the backdrop of multi-storey buildings flattened to the ground. . \"We know someone in that building who lived on the first floor... he didn't have enough time to get out of his house,\" one woman told us, gesturing towards a pile of rubble.. \"The building collapsed while he was still in there. He died alongside his wife and children,\" she said.. Only one of his daughters was saved from under the rubble and is in the hospital now.. The quake has brought more misery to a country already gripped by crisis. . The death toll across government and rebel-held areas has reached nearly 4,000, with more than 7,000 people reported injured or unaccounted for. . Much of Aleppo was destroyed in the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned violent.. Despite efforts to rebuild some parts of the former cosmopolitan hub, the city still bears the wounds of the war between the Russian-backed Syrian government and rebel groups.. Now, rescue teams have to pull down even some of the buildings still standing, out of fear they might collapse later on. . \"Two buildings near me came down; they each contained around 30 flats, and at least five people were living in each flat,\" on man told us.. \"There are around 60 or 70 people still trapped under the rubble; only four or five people got out,\" he said.. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the instability of the buildings left standing. . \"As you can see the buildings are shaking while we work to save people. We can't have that under international health and safety guidelines. So we've evacuated the residents\" an army officer told us.  . \"There are a large numbers of people in shelters. Most of them are people who were evacuated because their buildings are not safe,\" he continued. . Thousands of residents from the worst-hit eastern districts of Aleppo have been forced into shelters. . After years of war and now a hugely destructive earthquake, what comes next for them is unknown. . ",
