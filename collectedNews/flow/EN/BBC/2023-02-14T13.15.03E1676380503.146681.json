        "content": "The BBC said that it was \"fully co-operating\" with authorities.. \"We hope to have this situation resolved as soon as possible,\" a short statement added.. Although the documentary was broadcast on television only in the UK, India's government has attempted to block people sharing . online, calling it \"hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage\" with a \"colonial mind-set\". . Last month, police in Delhi detained students as they . The documentary focused on the prime minister's role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state. . The general secretary of the opposition Congress party, KC Venugopal, said Tuesday's search \"reeks of desperation and shows that the Modi government is scared of criticism\". . \"We condemn these intimidation tactics in the harshest terms. This undemocratic and dictatorial attitude cannot go on any longer,\" he tweeted.. But Gaurav Bhatia, a spokesman from Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), described the BBC as the \"most corrupt organisation in the world\". . \"India is a country which gives an opportunity to every organisation,\" he said, \"as long as you don't spew venom.\". He added the searches were lawful and the timing had nothing to do with the government.. The Editors Guild of India - a non-profit group which promotes press freedom - said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the searches. . They are a \"continuation of a trend of using government agencies to intimidate and harass press organisations that are critical of government policies or the ruling establishment\", it said.. The documentary tracks Mr Modi's first steps into politics, including his rise through the ranks of the BJP to his appointment as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.. It highlights a previously unpublished report, obtained by the BBC from the UK Foreign Office, which raises questions about Mr Modi's actions during the religious riots.. The rioting began the day after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire, killing dozens. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in the subsequent violence.. The Foreign Office report claims that Mr Modi was \"directly responsible\" for the \"climate of impunity\" that enabled the violence. . In 2005, the US denied Mr Modi a visa under a law that bars the entry of foreign officials seen to be responsible for \"severe violations of religious freedom\".. Mr Modi has long rejected accusations against him, and has not apologised for the riots. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel also said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.. The BBC said last month that the Indian government was offered a right to reply to the documentary but it declined.. The broadcaster said the film was \"rigorously researched\" and \"a wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions, including responses from people in the BJP\".. This video can not be played. From January: Students arrested before screening of BBC Modi documentary . The targeting of organisations seen as critical of the government is not uncommon in India. . In 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt its India operations, with the group accusing the government of pursuing a \"witch-hunt\" against human rights organisations.. Oxfam was also searched last year along with other local non-government organisations.. ",

        "content": "Aerial footage reveals the extent of flooding in Hawke's Bay in New Zealand's east. Chris Hipkins' government has declared a state of emergency - only the third in New Zealand's history.. About a third of the country's population of five million people live in affected areas.. Many people are displaced and some were forced to swim from their homes to safety after rivers burst their banks.. Others have been rescued from rooftops.. About a quarter of a million people are without power. Falling trees have smashed houses, and landslides have carried others away and blocked roads.  . The storm's damage has been most extensive in coastal communities on the far north and east coast of the North Island - with areas like Hawke's Bay, Coromandel and Northland among the worst hit.. Communications to one town in the region have been completely cut after a river burst its banks.. Civil defence authorities in Hawke's Bay said they couldn't cope with the scale of the damage. Australia and the UK have pledged to help.. A firefighter remains missing after being caught in a landslide in Muriwai, west of Auckland. A second firefighter involved was critically injured, rescue agencies said.. Marcelle Smith, whose family lives in a cliff-front property in Parua Bay on the east coast of the North Island, told the BBC she had fled inland with her two young children on Monday night.. Her husband remained behind to set up protections for their home. Some embankments set up had already been washed away and they were still battling wild weather on Tuesday.. \"We are trying to do everything we can to protect what we have put our lives into. It's man versus nature at this point,\" she told the BBC.. Local media have reported that some residents in Hawke's Bay had to swim through bedroom windows to escape as waters flooded their homes. People have been warned they could be without power for weeks.. Aerial pictures of flooded regions showed people stranded on rooftops waiting for rescue.. The vast scale of the damage includes uprooted trees, bent street lights and poles, and row after row of flooded homes.. New Zealand's Defence Force released dramatic pictures of officials rescuing a stranded sailor, whose yacht was swept out to sea when its anchor cable snapped amid strong winds. . \"The severity and the damage that we are seeing has not been experienced in a generation,\" Mr Hipkins said on Tuesday.. \"We are still building a picture of the effects of the cyclone as it continues to unfold. But what we do know is the impact is significant and it is widespread.\". He has pledged NZ$11.5m (Â£6m; US$7.3m) in aid to support those affected by the disaster.. Declaring the national state of emergency on Tuesday morning, the Minister for Emergency Management, Kieran McAnulty, described the storm as \"unprecedented\".. The emergency order enables the government to streamline its response to the disaster. It has been applied to the Northland, Auckland, Tairawhiti, Tararua, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Hawke's Bay regions.. New Zealand has only previously declared a national state of emergency on two occasions - during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.. The government has attributed the scale of the disaster to climate change.. \"The severity of it, of course, [is] made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees,\" said climate change minister James Shaw.. \"We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.\". Cyclone Gabrielle has hit New Zealand just two weeks after unprecedented downpours and flooding in the same region, which killed four people. . The MetService says conditions are expected to clear in coming days, and heavy rain warnings are being lifted for some parts of the country. But it has warned that wind could still cause further damage.. This video can not be played. Watch: Huge waves and heavy rain as Cyclone Gabrielle lashes New Zealand. ",

        "content": "The incident has provoked a range of responses - from indignation to fevered speculation - from the Chinese government and people.. After the Pentagon first announced the existence of the balloon on 2 February, Chinese officials refrained from an immediate response, only breaking their silence the following evening. . In a statement . , but added it was a \"civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes\" that had been blown off-course.. Taking a near-apologetic tone - rare for Beijing - they characterised it as an accident, saying they \"regretted the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure\".. But state media, which had mostly held off from reporting the story until the government's admission, got more defensive.. China Daily claimed the \"fabricated balloon lie cannot be tied down to China\", while the Global Times urged the US \"to be more sincere in fixing relations with China instead of making provocative actions against it\".. Netizens wasted no time in making jokes about the incident, with many calling the object \"The Wandering Balloon\" - a reference to the popular Chinese science-fiction novel and film The Wandering Earth.. The morning after, Chinese authorities released.  as news broke that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had called off a planned trip to China, claiming that \"some politicians and media in the US have hyped it up to attack and smear China\".. That same day, the US shot the balloon down - prompting Chinese ire.. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called it a \"a clear overreaction\" and \"unacceptable and irresponsible\". . \"The airship does not belong to the US. It belongs to China,\" she said, when asked if China had requested for the balloon's remnants to be returned. . Officials lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing.. Online, Chinese nationalists indignantly denounced the US. Prominent commentator Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of Global Times, thought the US \"had to end\" the situation by using a missile, because Americans \"aren't able to treat an accident by seeking truth from facts, instead they had to politicalise it\".. Meanwhile, a second balloon was spotted drifting over Latin America, which . On the Chinese internet there was fevered speculation about who exactly had launched the balloon, in the absence of details about its civilian origins.. Many seized upon recent news articles that mentioned a local company, ChemChina Zhuzhou Rubber Research and Design Institute, as one of the main producers of high-altitude balloons in China.. Some bloggers claimed ChemChina Zhuzhou, a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, had made the balloon. But there has been no evidence linking the company to the airship.. The confusion deepened on Sunday, when a report came out in news outlet The Paper about an unidentified object allegedly flying off the coast of the eastern Shandong province.. It said fisheries officials had sent out a warning to local fishermen that Chinese authorities were preparing to shoot down the object.  . The report was reproduced by some Chinese outlets, but state media and government departments remained silent. It sent the social media into overdrive nonetheless, with some accounts even live streaming satellite images over the area. . But some online reacted with suspicion and asked if it was real, questioning why the news had not been announced on more official channels.. On Monday, the Chinese government had a new claim - that .  at least 10 times in the past year.. \"The first thing the US side should do is start with a clean slate, undergo some self-reflection, instead of smearing and accusing China,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman. . The US has denied the accusation.. At the same time, state media has begun focusing on a different narrative - a derailed train carrying hazardous material in Ohio.. Though the incident happened in early February, Chinese news outlets are now devoting significant coverage on the topic, citing US media reports. Officials have performed .  to prevent contamination.. It has since become a significant talking point on social media. On Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, views of the Ohio train hashtag has soared up to 690 million times since the weekend, with more than 40 hashtags created around the topic.. Many Chinese netizens have expressed worry that the incident would turn into a global environment crisis, and anger over the relatively sparser coverage of the train incident in US media compared to the balloons.. \"Turns out the Wandering Balloon was being used to take the heat for Ohio,\" a post liked nearly 3,000 times reads..
