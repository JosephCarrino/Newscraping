        "content": "Opponents say they threaten democracy.. At one of Saturday's rallies, opposition leader Yair Lapid said this was Israel's \"greatest crisis\".. In a separate development, Israeli troops shot dead three armed Palestinians near the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday, the Israeli army said. It said the gunmen had fired at an Israeli army post. . Palestinian officials have not commented on the incident. There has been a marked surge in violence between Palestinians and Israel . On Saturday, protest organisers said as many as 500,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Israel, in what the Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".. About 200,000 people turned up in Tel Aviv, and a record crowd of 50,000 marched in the northern city of Haifa. . It was the 10th consecutive week of nationwide protests against the government plans.. Speaking in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Mr Lapid warned that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis.. \"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday .  But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.. Tamir Guytsabry, a protester in Tel Aviv, told Reuters: \"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that [is] making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids.\". The reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges, and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. Last Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.. The government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "An East African force was also recently deployed to the area, which is rich in minerals and has dozens of militias.. The UN says the conflict forced 300,000 people from their homes last month.. This happened in North-Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and Uganda, and is a fertile and mountainous area long plundered by rival groups.. There is increasing concern about the humanitarian crisis caused by the fighting, which was still ongoing on Friday.  . The European Union has just started an operation to fly in aid to the regional capital, Goma, saying humanitarian agencies have become overwhelmed.. A statement from the Angolan president's office said the soldiers would be deployed to help secure areas that have been held by the M23 rebel group and to protect ceasefire monitors. . Kenyan soldiers, who are part of the East African Community Regional Force, have deployed to these areas too.. The rebels, who are widely reported to be backed by Rwanda, had just hours earlier said they would withdraw from several captured villages. . The Congolese government will welcome the arrival of Angolan troops to help in the fight against the rebels.. But there is a danger of this becoming a wider international conflict.. More than 20 years ago the armies of at least eight African countries fought a war in eastern DR Congo, dubbed . , that caused immense suffering for the civilian population.  . Rwanda has for many years criticised the Congolese authorities for failing to disarm Hutu rebels - some of whom are linked to the Rwandan genocide in 1994.. It denies backing the M23, which has captured vast swathes of territory over the past year and has been advancing towards Goma.. A decade ago, M23 fighters also captured large parts of North Kivu - but were eventually routed by UN and regional troops and as part of a peace deal disarmed. . They began regrouping early last year.. Largely made up of Congolese army deserters, they first took up arms in 2009 accusing the government of marginalising the country's ethnic Tutsi minority and failing to honour previous peace accords..

One person is reported to have died, bringing the death toll to at least 28 since the storm first made landfall.. The cyclone made its second landfall near the eastern seaport of Quelimane at around 22:00 (20:00 GMT) on Saturday.. People have been urged to move into temporary shelters - including schools, churches and warehouses.. More than half a million people could be at risk of a humanitarian crisis this time around, according to local disaster agencies. .

Electricity has been turned off as a precaution by the power utility firm and all flights have been suspended, according to TVM.. The cyclone is reported to have stalled offshore and is thought to be making its way on to land soon.. \"I can see some houses with roofs torn apart, broken windows and the streets flooded. It's really scary,\" charity worker Vania Massingue, from the port city of  Quelimane in Zambezia province, told Reuters.. Experts says climate change is making tropical storms around the world wetter, windier and more intense.. Freddy had already broken records for the strength it has accumulated over the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean for north-western Australia..

Mozambique's national disaster management agency estimates more than 1.5 million people have been affected since the storm first hit last month, with more than 8,000 forced from their homes..

        "content": "Watch: The Mexican kidnapping saga explained in 80 seconds. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) said that drug cartel violence represented a significant threat for anyone crossing into Mexico.. It comes after four Americans . Two of them were murdered, while two were released unharmed.. Three American women who went to Mexico to sell clothes at a market have been missing for more than two weeks.. \"Drug cartel violence and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat to anyone who crosses into Mexico right now,\" said DPS director Steven McCraw. . \"Based on the volatile nature of cartel activity and the violence we are seeing there, we are urging individuals to avoid travel to Mexico at this time.\". Four Americans were kidnapped by a drug cartel, and two of them were murdered, when they visited the town of Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this month. A Mexican bystander was also killed in the shooting.. The cartel responsible has since apologised for the incident and handed over its own gunmen to the police.. A letter left with the cartel gunmen, who had been left on the roadside, accused them of acting \"under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\" as well as supposedly breaking cartel rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\".. It was signed by the \"Scorpions Group\", a splinter faction of the powerful Gulf Cartel.. Mexican authorities believe the gang members mistook the Americans for rivals and shot at them when they tried to escape.. The incident threatens to sour relations between the two countries. . A Republican senator has urged President Joe Biden's administration to allow the deployment of US troops over the border to fight the cartels. . Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador called the proposals \"arrogant\".. Meanwhile, two sisters from Texas and a friend are missing in Mexico after they crossed the border last month to sell clothes at a flea market, US officials say.. The husband of one of the women reported their disappearance to police in Texas after days going by without news. . \"We don't know if they made it there,\" Roel Bermea, police chief in the border town of Penitas, told the AFP news agency. . The FBI had been notified, he added.. ",
