        "content": "Watch: Chaotic scenes inside mosque after blast kills at least 32. The mosque is within the tightly-guarded police headquarters area. . Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said \"terrorists want to create fear by targeting those who perform the duty of defending Pakistan\".. No group has said it carried out the attack, but it has been linked to the Pakistan Taliban.. The group ended a ceasefire in November, and violence has been on the rise since. . In December it targeted a police station - like Peshawar, in the .  - leading to the deaths of 33 militants.. Early unconfirmed reports said a bomber had blown himself up in the mosque on Monday.. A hospital spokesman told the BBC the death toll stands at 59, while 157 people were injured..

In a statement, PM Sharif said those behind the attack \"have nothing to do with Islam\". He added: \"The entire nation is standing united against the menace of terrorism.\". The blast took place around 13:30 (08:30 GMT) during afternoon prayers in the north-western city, near the country's border with Afghanistan.. A video circulating on social media and verified by the BBC showed that half of a wall caved in. The mosque was covered in bricks and debris as people clambered over the rubble to escape.. A rescue operation is continuing inside the mosque and \"more bodies are being taken out,\" Peshawar city Deputy Commissioner Shafiullah Khan said.. \"Currently our priority is to save people buried under the debris,\" Mr Khan added.. Hours after the blast, BBC News witnessed a facility full of the injured, many still wearing their police uniforms.. Some were covered in burns cream, their skin red with burns from the explosion.

        "content": "Watch: Johnson says Putin threatened him in phone call before Ukraine invasion. The then-prime minister said Mr Putin told him it \"would only take a minute\".. Mr Johnson said the comment was made after he warned the war would be an \"utter catastrophe\".. The claim is made in a BBC documentary on Mr Putin's interactions with world leaders over the years. The Kremlin spokesman said it was a \"lie\"..  Mr Johnson warned Mr Putin that invading Ukraine would lead to Western sanctions and more Nato troops on Russia's borders. . He also tried to deter Russian military action by telling Mr Putin that Ukraine would not join Nato \"for the foreseeable future\". . But Mr Johnson said: \"He threatened me at one point, and he said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you but, with a missile, it would only take a minute' or something like that. Jolly. . \"But I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.\". President Putin had been \"very familiar\" during the \"most extraordinary call\", Mr Johnson said.  . No reference to the exchange appeared in accounts released to the media of the call by Downing Street. But with all officially arranged phone calls, there are always detailed minutes taken by a Number 10 official and retained for the archive. . From the 2014 seizure of Crimea to the invasion of Ukraine, this is the inside story of a decade of clashes - as told by the Western leaders who traded blows with Putin's Russia.. It is impossible to know if Mr Putin's threat was genuine.  . However, given previous Russian attacks on the UK - most recently in Salisbury in 2018 - any threat from the Russian leader, however lightly delivered, is probably one Mr Johnson would have had no choice but to take seriously. . In his response, Mr Putin's spokesman said the former prime minister's claim was \"either a deliberate falsehood, in which case you need to ask Mr Johnson why he lied, or it was not a deliberate lie. That is, he didn't understand what President Putin was saying to him\".. \"There were no threats to use missiles,\" Dmitry Peskov told the BBC. . The Kremlin leader, he said, had simply pointed out that \"if Ukraine joined Nato the potential deployment of Nato or US missiles near Russia's border would mean that any missile could reach Moscow within minutes\".. Since the invasion, President Putin has warned countries that may try to interfere, that Russia's response would be immediate - even hinting at the use of nuclear weapons.. Nine days after Mr Johnson's conversation with President Putin, on 11 February, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Moscow to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu.. The BBC documentary Putin Vs the West reveals Mr Wallace left with assurances that Russia would not invade Ukraine, but he said both sides knew it was a lie. . He described it as a \"demonstration of bullying or strength, which is: I'm going to lie to you, you know I'm lying and I know you know I'm lying and I'm still going to lie to you.. \"I think it was about saying 'I'm powerful',\" Mr Wallace said. . He said the \"fairly chilling, but direct lie\" had confirmed his belief that Russia would invade. . As he left the meeting, he said Gen Valery Gerasimov - Russia's chief of general staff - told him \"never again will we be humiliated\".. Another significant encounter in the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine was with CIA director William Burns, who landed in Moscow on 2 November 2021.. Mr Burns had been circling the Russian capital for hours, as heavy fog prevented his landing, but when he finally arrived at the Kremlin he discovered Mr Putin was not there. Instead, he was sheltering in the southern Russian city of Sochi amid a spike in Covid infections.. The pair spoke over the phone.. The CIA director said he was direct in laying out the message President Biden had sent him to deliver: the US knew what Mr Putin was up to and he would pay a heavy price if he launched such an invasion.. He said the Russian president did not deny planning was underway and listed grievances about Ukraine and the West.. \"I was troubled before I arrived in Moscow. And I was even more troubled after I left,\" Mr Burns added.. Less than a fortnight after the UK defence secretary left Moscow, as tanks rolled over the border on 24 February, Mr Johnson received a phone call in the middle of the night from President Zelensky.. \"Zelensky's very, very calm,\" Mr Johnson recalled. \"But, he tells me, you know, they're attacking everywhere.\". Mr Johnson says he offered to help move the president to safety. . \"He doesn't take me up on that offer. He heroically stayed where he was.\". ",

As part of the policy change in Sichuan, unmarried individuals will also now be able to raise children.. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.. In 2016, China scrapped its controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases even lost jobs. . In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy also led to forced abortions.. But the changes that began in 2016 failed to halt the decline in the birth rate. Deaths outnumbered births . Now, there will be no limit on the number of children people can have in Sichuan, a province of 80 million people in the south west of the country.. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made boosting birth rates a priority. The government has offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare to reverse or slow the falling rates. . It comes as China is still battling Covid-related .  The virus tore through towns and cities after the lifting of zero-Covid restrictions in December.. Neighbouring countries, including Japan, are also facing falling birth rates. Japan's prime minister says, as a result, .  of not being able to function as a society.. ",
