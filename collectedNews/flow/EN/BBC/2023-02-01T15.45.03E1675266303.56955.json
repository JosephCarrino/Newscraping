        "content": "A huge search was triggered when the object was lost while being transported along a 1,400km (870 mile) route across the state. . Authorities released a close-up picture of the pea-sized capsule - which could cause serious harm if handled - on the ground among tiny pebbles.. A serial number enabled them to verify they had found the right capsule, which is 6mm (0.24 inches) in diameter and 8mm long.. It contains a small quantity of Caesium-137, which could cause skin damage, burns or radiation sickness.. Mining giant Rio Tinto apologised for losing the device, which is used as a density gauge in the mining industry.. A 20m \"hot zone\" has now been established around the capsule and it will be placed into a lead container.. It will be stored at a secure location in the town of Newman overnight before being transported to a secure facility in the city of Perth on Thursday.. Announcing their find, the state emergency services paid tribute to \"inter-agency teamwork in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds\".. The capsule was found when a vehicle equipped with specialist equipment, which was travelling at 70 km/h (43 mph), detected radiation, officials said.. Portable detection equipment was then used to locate the capsule, which was found about 2m (7ft) from the side of the road.. The device is part of a density gauge, which was being used at Rio Tinto's Gudai-Darri mine in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia. . \"The simple fact is the device should never have been lost,\" said the head of the company's iron ore division, Simon Trott. He thanked the authorities for the \"pretty incredible recovery\" of the capsule.. Rio Tinto would be happy to reimburse the cost of the search if requested by the government, Mr Trott added.. Australian authorities have promised a review of existing laws on the matter.  . Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Perth that the current fine for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is \"ridiculously low\".  It currently stands at A$1,000 ($700, £575) and A$50 ($35, £30) for every day that the offence continues.. Exposure to trace quantities of the metal is like \"receiving 10 X-rays in an hour, just to put it in context, and... the amount of natural radiation we would receive in a year, just by walking around,\" said Western Australia's chief health officer Andrew Robertson earlier this week.. It was thought that the capsule may have gone missing up to two weeks ago.. The search area for the lost capsule was huge. It is roughly equivalent to the distance by road from John O'Groats in northern Scotland to Land's End in south-west England, or from Washington DC to Orlando, Florida.. The state's desert is remote and one of the least populated places in the country. Only one in five of Western Australia's population lives outside of Perth, the state's capital.. The gauge was being transported by a subcontracted company, which picked it up from the mine site on 12 January to move it to a storage facility in the north-east suburbs of Perth.. When it was unpacked for inspection on 25 January the gauge was found broken apart and the radioactive capsule was gone. One of four mounting bolts and screws were also missing.. Authorities said vibrations during transit may have caused the bolts to become loose, allowing the capsule to fall through gaps in the casing and truck.. This incident came as Rio Tinto tries to repair its reputation in Australia.. In 2020, .  in Western Australia to expand an iron ore mine, sparking a major outcry that led to several of the company's top bosses standing down.. And last year, . , after an internal review at Rio Tinto found more than 20 women had reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over five years.. ",

        "content": "Three of the suspects are dual US-Haitian citizens and one is Colombian.. They are due to appear in a federal court in Miami later on Wednesday.   . The investigation being conducted into President Moise's assassination in Haiti has stalled, with investigators and judges receiving death threats. But as the plan to kill Mr Moise was allegedly hatched by Haitian-Americans in Florida, investigations are proceeding in the US.. The transfer of the four men from Haiti to Florida has brought the total number of suspects in US custody to seven.. Three of those moved to the US have been charged with conspiracy to murder President Moise. The fourth, Christian Sanon, was charged with smuggling bullet-proof vests to Haiti for use in the plot.. Those charged with conspiracy to commit murder are:. Prosecutors allege that James Solages and Christian Sanon met in Florida in April 2021 to discuss \"regime change\" in Haiti. . According to police in Haiti, Mr Sanon, a Haitian-American doctor and pastor, had \"political objectives\" to replace Mr Moise as president. . Haiti's police chief at the time of President Moise's killing also said that Mr Sanon was the first person one of the assailants called as police surrounded them after the murder.. In a statement, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said that while Mr Sanon had not been charged with conspiracy to murder, he \"participated in crimes that culminated in the assassination of the Haitian president\".. According to the DoJ, James Solages, Joseph Vincent and Germán Rivera had originally planned to kidnap President Moise and take him to an unknown location while a new president was installed in his stead.. But when they failed to get a plane to take the Mr Moise away, they allegedly changed their plan.. \"It is alleged that on July 6, 2021, Solages, Vincent, Rivera and others met at a house near President Moise's residence, where firearms and equipment was distributed and Solages announced that the mission was to kill President Moise,\" the DoJ statement said. . The other man, German Alejandro Rivera, is suspected of having recruited the Colombian mercenaries who made up the hit squad hired for the purpose.. All four men were arrested in Haiti shortly after President Moise's assassination and been held in the Caribbean nation until their transfer on Tuesday. . If found guilty, Mr Sanon could face up to 20 years in jail while the three other suspect could be sentenced to life in prison. . The political void left by the killing has led to a surge in violence and lawlessness across Haiti.. ",

        "content": "The call came as the UK, US, Canada and Australia announced fresh sanctions against army-linked firms.. The military administration on Wednesday extended a state of emergency for six months. . The strike was held to mark two years since . , removing the democratically-elected government.. The army made allegations of widespread voter fraud in a vote held months earlier, in November 2020, which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won with more than 80% of the vote. . The military's claims have been dismissed as baseless by the vast majority of the international community, and plans to hold new elections to cement junta rule have been dismissed as a \"sham\", including by the UN. . Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a pro-democracy activist, said resistance against the military was continuing, particularly in rural areas. . \"The main message of the silent strike is to honour the fallen heroes and heroines and to reclaim the public space as our own,\" she told the BBC, adding that the aim was to send a clear message that the military \"shall never rule us\". . Protesters also gathered outside Myanmar's embassies in Thailand and Japan, chanting anti-military slogans and holding portraits of jailed democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. . A small pro-military demonstration took place in Yangon, where an estimated 200 supporters marched through the city centre escorted part of the way by soldiers, AFP news agency reported. . Two years after the coup, which catastrophically misread the public mood in Myanmar, the statistics tell their own, dismal story. . More than 2,900 people have been killed during the junta's crackdown on dissent, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.. One-and-a-half million people have been displaced, 40,000 homes have been burned down, eight million children are no longer in school, and 15 million people are judged by the UN to be dangerously short of food. . Much of the country is caught up in a brutal civil war. Yet the military is still refusing to negotiate with its opponents, as it promised to do in a meeting with neighbouring countries shortly after the coup. . Instead, it has plans for an election which would almost certainly exclude Suu Kyi, who resoundingly won the last election, and much of her party, NLD.. Those loyal to her are calling on citizens to boycott any poll organised by the military, arguing it would be illegitimate and impractical. The UN says these would be \"sham elections\". . The military's acknowledgement this week that it had failed to normalise the situation may force it to postpone the election - originally scheduled for August this year - and extend the state of emergency, prolonging the grim stalemate in which Myanmar is trapped.. Western nations used Wednesday's anniversary to coordinate new rounds of sanctions against the military and its supporters. . The UK targeted, among others, companies supplying aviation fuel to the military, which it said were \"enabling its barbaric air-raiding campaign in an attempt to maintain power\".. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the sanctions were aimed at \"reducing the military's access to finance, fuel, arms and equipment\". . Australia announced its first sanctions against the military, aimed at 16 individuals \"responsible for egregious human rights abuses\", as well as two major military-controlled conglomerates, which dominate the country's economy.  . Sanctions by the US targeted the military-approved election commission, which \"the regime has deployed to advance its plans for deeply flawed elections\". . The National Unity Government - a parallel administration that leads opposition to the military - welcomed the sanctions, calling them \"significant measures\" to tackle the conflict, particularly air strikes by the military.. It called on countries to place further \"aggressive, targeted sanctions\" on the military regime and those who supported and supplied it.. Amnesty International's Montse Ferrer told the BBC that moves to stop the supply of aviation fuel to the Myanmar military were \"an important step\" but that more needed to be done. . \"Other states should follow Canada's lead in suspending the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer - including transit, trans-shipment and brokering - of aviation fuel to Myanmar,\" she said. .

        "content": "Watch: \"You know I'm innocent\" - Andrew Tate yells to reporters. Handcuffed to his brother Tristan, he shouted to waiting reporters that he was innocent.. The pair have been held since late December as police investigate allegations of rape and exploitation, which both men deny.. Last month, a judge extended their detention until the end of February.. Police have not yet laid any charges against the brothers, who moved to Romania five years ago. . Filing an appeal against the custody extension on Wednesday, Andrew's lawyer Ioan Gliga told journalists that he had \"new evidence\" to refute prosecutors' arguments.  . \"The victims deny any wrongdoing - it's only in the minds of the prosecution that a crime has been committed,\" he said.. A verdict in the appeal is expected later today.. Also present in court was a new legal adviser hired by the Tate brothers from the United States. Tina Glandian has experience in representing high-profile figures such as Mike Tyson and Chris Brown, and specialises in international human rights.  . There is speculation that her appointment could bring a new approach to the Tates' legal team, as they try to secure the brothers' release from preventative custody.. The brothers - who have both US and British citizenship - have also employed a communications specialist to respond to media interest in the case.. In explaining his decision to keep the Tates in custody for another month, a judge last week issued a strongly worded statement, describing \"the capacity… of the defendants to exercise permanent psychological control over the victims... including by resorting to constant acts of violence\".. The testimony of alleged victims, he said, \"revealed a pattern of action\" that lent their reports credibility.  He also highlighted what he said was the \"particular dangerousness\" of the Tate brothers, in \"their ability to target… vulnerable victims\".. Since then, local media have reported that four complaints were made by alleged victims at a police station near the Tate compound - at least one of them as far back as 2021. At least one of the complaints was reportedly not acted on until the Tate investigation was underway.. The Police Inspectorate said in a statement that it had \"started checks\" into the actions of officers there, to determine if any legal measures should follow.. ",
