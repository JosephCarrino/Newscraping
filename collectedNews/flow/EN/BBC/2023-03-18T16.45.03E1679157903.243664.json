        "content": "Watch: Imran Khan's chaotic court summons in 60 seconds. Police said Mr Khan's backers threw stones and fired tear gas near the court complex.. The former cricketer-turned-politician has since set off back to his home in Lahore, which police raided in his absence and made arrests.. He denies the charges against him.. The chaotic scenes saw Mr Khan unable to enter the court before the judge agreed that he could mark his attendance and return home.. The ex-PM says the charges against him are politically motivated but says he is attending court \"because I believe in the rule of law\". The government says the charges against him have nothing to do with politics.. He told Reuters that he had formed a committee to lead his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), in the event of his arrest.. About 4,000 security officials, including elite commandos and anti-terrorism squads, have been deployed in Islamabad, AFP reported.. Police blocked the highway into Islamabad with shipping containers and large trucks to stop Mr Khan's convoy as it approached the city. . Officers armed with sticks and tear gas cannisters let his vehicle through, but most of his supporters were turned away.. Speaking to the BBC when the convoy was stationary, Mr Khan said that the authorities were trying to put him in prison to keep him out of the general election race later this year. \"I won't be able to campaign - that's the whole thing,\" he said.. Earlier this week he told the BBC: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". In a sign of the deep divisions within Pakistani politics, the current Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted that Mr Khan's \"antics of the last few days\" had \"laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies\" and accused him of using supporters as \"human shields\".. Earlier in the week Lahore police tried to arrest Mr Khan after he missed a hearing, and officers clashed with supporters outside his home. On Friday, the court granted Mr Khan protection against arrest on the assurance that he would appear in court on Saturday. . On Saturday Lahore police used a digger to gain entry to Mr Khan's residence in an operation involving nearly 1,000 security personnel, according to local media. Police later said they had arrested Khan supporters who had been involved in violence against police earlier in the week, including for throwing petrol bombs.. The Punjab police chief said some officers would remain outside Mr Khan's residence.. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister last April in a no-confidence vote but has kept up pressure on his successor Mr Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He blames Mr Sharif for an assassination attempt at a rally in November in which he was wounded in the leg. Authorities have rejected the accusation.. Mr Khan faces multiple court cases, including terrorism charges. He has cited a variety of reasons - including security concerns and injury from the assassination attempt in November - for not showing up to hearings. . ",

        "content": "Trading in cryptocurrencies has become popular, with people often promised large rewards over short periods.. But law enforcement agencies warn of a growing number of scams and recommend investors conduct \"due diligence\".. Roxana, not her real name, is from Romania. She says she lost hundreds of euros when she invested in iEarn Bot. She asked not to have her identity revealed as she fears her professional reputation might be damaged.. Customers buying the bots - like Roxana - were told their investment would be handled by the company's artificial intelligence programme, guaranteeing high returns.. \"I invested in a bot for one month,\" Roxana tells the BBC. \"You could see in the app how many dollars the app was creating: there were graphics showing how the investment was progressing. . \"It looked quite professional until, at some point, they announced maintenance.\" At that point, for some time, withdrawals from the app were frozen.. \"Some people started to say 'I cannot withdraw... what is happening',\" explains Roxana. \"I made the request to withdraw and the money just disappeared. The portfolio became zero - but I was never credited on my wallet with any money.\". In Romania, dozens of high-profile figures, including government officials and academics, were persuaded to invest via the app because it was sponsored by Gabriel Garais, a leading IT expert in the country. . Mr Garais says he too was fooled into investing his own savings in the app and lost his money.. But Roxana insists, had it not been for Garais's sponsorship, she would have never considered investing.. \"We had the knowledge to think this might be a scam,\" she says, \"but the fact that, in between us and the company there was a reputable teacher, meant that we didn't check too much - we didn't doubt too much.\". What happened in Romania is not an isolated incident. Nor is it unique to Romania. . When Silvia Tabusca, a Romanian organised crime expert from the European Center for Legal Education and Research, began looking into iEarn Bot, she discovered that many people in other countries had also lost their money in the scheme. . What surprised her most was the scale of the operation.. \"From what we have seen, the number of investors is quite high,\" she says. \"In Indonesia, for example, they [iEarn Bot] claim they had 800,000 customers.\" . \"At first the app works very well,\" says Ms Tabusca. . \"When they have enough investors and enough money invested in a specific country, they don't allow that country to withdraw any more - and they open other countries.\" . iEarn Bot presents itself as a US-based company with excellent credentials, but when the BBC fact-checked some information on its website, it raised some red flags.. The man whom the site names as the company's founder told us he had never heard of them. He said he has made a complaint to the police. . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, alongside companies such as Huawei and Qualcomm, are all named as \"strategic partners\" of iEarn Bot, but they too said they have no knowledge of the company and they are not working with it.. On the website, the company does not provide any contact information. When the BBC checked the history of its Facebook page, we learned that until the end of 2021, the account was advertising weight-loss products. It is managed from Vietnam and Cambodia.. iEarn Bot places a big emphasis on pushing investors to recruit more people to join the app. . \"The way people in this company operate is more similar to a Ponzi scheme, than an actual business,\" says Ms Tabusca.. The BBC has also seen chat conversations where people, who claim to be from iEarn Bot's customer service, told investors that in order to withdraw their money, they must pay a 30% fee. . \"Some people were quite desperate to get their money back, so they paid the fee - but they still couldn't withdraw,\" says Ms Tabusca.. The BBC has repeatedly approached iEarn Bot for comment but so far it has not responded.. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Colombia, local leaders were pushed by iEarn Bot mentors - with whom they only ever communicated on Telegram - to organise recruiting events.. Andres, from Colombia, said he actively recruited people to join the app. He still believes the company is legitimate.. \"They had their registration in the US that showed they were legit,\" he says. \"And they were paying.\". In his country, withdrawals were stopped in December. People were told the company was transforming investment in USDT - a well-established cryptocurrency - into a new coin called iBot, which had the same value. . Investors were asked to be patient until March, when the new coin was expected to be officially launched. But people are still waiting to access their money.. \"[People] took loans to invest. They used money from other sources, many people were affected,\" says Andres. \"As the local leaders did not have answers, people started to get angry.\". With the help of an analyst, the BBC managed to identify one main crypto wallet that received payments from about 13,000 potential victims, for a profit of almost $1.3m (Â£1m) in less than one year.. But we could not track down where and to whom the money went. . For investigators, this is a common issue.. \"One of the challenges is to identify and attribute who the illicit actor is, where the value is going, and then being able to take investigative steps and law enforcement action,\" says John Wyman, chief of the FBI's new Virtual Assets Unit.. Investigations in this sort of scheme, he says, go global quickly. . Such investigations require international co-operation and may take longer, but he insists that those responsible are eventually brought to justice.. The FBI set up the Virtual Assets Unit last year in order to respond to the growing number of crimes using virtual currencies. . It invites people who have been victims of scams to make a complaint on the FBI's dedicated page.. But law enforcement agencies maintain the best way to fight scammers remains prevention.. \"Knowledge - and doing some due diligence before the investment  - it's critical,\" says Mr Wyman. . \"It's like everything else: if it sounds too good to be true, it often is.\".

        "content": "Watch: The river filled with dead fish. The large-scale fish deaths were first reported on Friday morning in the New South Wales' (NSW) town of Menindee.. The state's river authority said it was a result of an ongoing heatwave affecting the Darling-Baaka river.. Locals say it is the largest fish death event to hit the town, that experienced another significant mass death of fish just three years ago..  the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said the heatwave put \"further stress on a system that has experienced extreme conditions from wide-scale flooding\".. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.. Speaking to the BBC, Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb described the deaths as \"surreal\". . \"It'll probably be a bit more confronting today,\" he said, as he warned that locals were anticipating that even more fish would die as the already decomposing fish sucked more oxygen from the water. . Around 500 people live in the town in far-west New South Wales. The Darling-Baaka river is a part of the Murray Darling Basin, Australia's largest river system.. The NSW DPI also said that the fish deaths were \"distressing to the local community\", a sentiment echoed by Mr McCrabb.. \"You can just imagine leaving a fish in your kitchen to rot with all the doors shut and no air conditioner, and we've got millions of them.\". The temperature in Menindee was expected to reach 41C on Saturday.. He added that locals in the regional town rely on the Darling-Baaka for water supplies, \"we use the river water for washing and showering in so people won't be able to use that water for those basic needs again,\" he said.. \"Over time those people won't be able to access that water for domestic use which is just shameful\".. This week's fish deaths throws a light on the troubles facing the Murray Darling Basin. Drought and increased human use has impacted the health of the Murray Darling ecosystem. . The Murray Darling Basin authority said agriculture, industries and communities have used water from the river system which has resulted in less water flowing through the river.. It also said the Basin is prone to extreme weather events and has a highly variable climate that makes it vulnerable to both fires and droughts. . In 2012, a plan worth A$13bn (Â£8.45bn at the time) was implemented to try and stop the river from drying up and returning it to a healthier level.. The NSW DPI said it will work with federal agencies to respond to the latest incident, and to find the underlying causes of the deaths. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Violence erupts in Paris as pension protests continue. Thousands of demonstrators lit fires and some threw firecrackers at police, who used tear gas to disperse them.. It is the second night of unrest since President Emmanuel Macron decided to push through the controversial reforms to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 . No-confidence motions have been filed against his government in response.. The first was signed by independents and members of the left-wing Nupes coalition in parliament, while a second came from the far-right National Rally party.. Both are expected to be debated early next week. . Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally MPs in parliament, called the decision to push through the pension changes \"a total failure for the government\".. Police made dozens of arrests during the unrest at Place de la Concorde, not far from the parliament building.. Protests also took place on Friday in other French cities - notably Bordeaux, Toulon and Strasbourg. . \"We won't give up,\" one demonstrator told AFP news agency. \"There's still hope that the reform can be revoked.\". Another told Reuters that pushing the legislation through without a vote was \"a denial of democracy... a total denial of what has been happening in the streets for several weeks\".. The government has said the changes to pensions are essential to ensure the system is not overburdened and prevent it collapsing. . But many people, including union members, disagree and France has now seen more than two months of heated political debate and strikes over the issue. . Transport, public services and schools have all been affected, while a rolling walkout by waste collectors has seen .  and there are plans to stop production at a large refinery in Normandy in the coming days. . \"Changing the government or prime minister will not put out this fire, only withdrawing the reform,\" said the head of the moderate CFDT union, Laurent Berger..
