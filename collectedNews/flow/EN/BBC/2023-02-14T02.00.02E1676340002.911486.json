        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spox. The objects posed a threat to commercial flights and were downed in the \"best interests\" of the American people, spokesman John Kirby said.. The US is scrutinising its airspace more closely since the recent incursion of a suspected spy balloon from China.. Beijing has alleged that Washington is flying its own balloons over China.. China's foreign ministry said on Monday that the US had flown balloons into its airspace more than 10 times in the past year.. \"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,\" spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.. Speaking from the White House, Mr Kirby denied the allegation: \"We are not flying surveillance balloons over China. I'm not aware of any other craft we're flying into Chinese airspace.\". On 4 February, a high-altitude balloon was downed off the coast of South Carolina after moving for days over the continental US.. US officials said it had originated in China and was used to monitor sensitive military sites, but China denied the object was used for spying and said it was a weather monitoring device that had blown astray.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Michigan - and the administration has been under pressure to identify the objects.. A Pentagon spokesman on Sunday appeared to suggest the US had not ruled out that the objects were of an extraterrestrial nature, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied this at Monday's press briefing.. \"There is no indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns,\" she said. \"I wanted to be sure the American people knew that and it is important for us to say that from here.\". Mr Kirby, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, joined Ms Jean-Pierre at the briefing.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. There were differences between the alleged Chinese spy balloon and the three objects downed over the weekend, he said. The latter did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were taken down \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\".. Efforts are currently under way to collect debris from where the objects fell, but Mr Kirby noted the objects in Alaska and Canada were in remote terrain and would be difficult to find in winter weather conditions, while the object in Michigan, he said, lay in the deep waters of Lake Huron.. Officials have not yet been able to \"definitively assess\" these objects, but have not ruled out the possibility they were conducting surveillance, he said. . He accused Beijing of operating a \"balloon programme for intelligence collection\" that has ties to the Chinese military and was not detected during the Trump administration.. \"We detected it. We tracked it, and we have been carefully studying it to learn as much as we can,\" he said.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles) and that experts were analysing wind models from Sunday to try to narrow the search field. . Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sean McGillis said the search in the Yukon was \"treacherous\" as the debris was probably located in \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Mr McGillis added that there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote locations. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost concurred that the three most recent objects to be shot down differed from the first balloon.. He said all three appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discover debris should contact the police directly.. ",

        "content": "Rescue teams freed him from the rubble of his home in the now devastated city of Kahramanmaras, 105 hours after the earthquake. . When he was brought into the intensive care unit, hypothermia had set in and his body temperature had dropped to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit).. Aras may have survived, but his seven-year-old sister Hiranur did not. Neither did his nine-year-old brother Alp. Nor his father. . Just one of so many families irrevocably broken by this disaster.. Sitting at Aras's bedside and gently ruffling his grandson's dark hair Is Mehmet.. \"He's an honest boy. He has a strong personality. He's sincere. He's not a spoilt boy.\" . Although now 72, Mehmet tells us he will for the rest of his days look after Aras as if he were his own son. . \"The rescuers did so well to save him,\" he says, \"and by God's grace, they gave him back to us alive.\" . Aras winces a little as the doctor changes the bandage on his swollen left foot. He's making a good recovery. . Aras's mum also survived - but he hasn't seen her since their world imploded. She is being treated at another hospital in the city but is expected to recover.. It was in an intensive care unit set up by Israeli doctors where Aras's own life was saved. . But as we walked through the ward on Monday, it was not just a child with a remarkable story but also a 65-year-old man. . Samir from Syria was plucked from the rubble after enduring six freezing nights. . Doctors then saved him, but both his legs had to be amputated. . For the medics at the heart of this disaster it's been an exhausting and traumatic week. . Paediatrician Dr Mehmet Cihan travelled from Istanbul as quickly as he could to help colleagues in this broken city. . \"It's very bad. Too many children have lost their parents. I don't know. It's very hard for me... too hard for me.\". The international medical effort reaches far beyond Kahramanmaras. . In the town of Turkoglu, green British tents pitched by NHS doctors stand alongside Turkish tents with red tarpaulin. . UK doctors are setting up a field hospital in the grounds of the town's hospital which was damaged in the quake. . The need for emergency care in the hours after the earthquake may have passed - but 80,000 people living here are lacking many medical services.. Dr Bryony Pointon is a GP from Chichester, who has come to Turkey as part of UK-Med - a front-line medical aid charity funded by the British government.. \"We are working with the Turkish doctors and nurses that are here - setting up their own tents and seeing patients but they are quite overwhelmed,\" she explains. . \"After all the trauma you have the people who have their usual chronic illnesses - they are still unwell, they don't have the facilities to cope. So, we will see those patients, as many as we can.\". Doctors and nurses from around the world are now in Turkey to help with the physical injuries. . But the mental trauma is also profound - both the personal and the national.. ",
