        "content": "Prosecutors have been looking at a possible indictment of Mr Trump. Reports say it could come next week.. If he is indicted, it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. This case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump's behalf by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.. It is one of several cases in which the 76-year-old is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted. . Past efforts to investigate him, including two impeachment trials, the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago raid, have tended to make him more popular with his base, so an indictment could have a similar effect.. It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged this week or even, beyond broad strokes, what those charges might be. . But with the former president predicting an arrest, and calling for mass protests, this is a journey into unknown territory.. Mr Trump has a loyal base of followers, and the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters following his repeated calls to protest has proven that a fraught situation can quickly escalate into violence.. On Saturday Mr Trump wrote on his social networking site Truth Social that \"illegal leaks\" from the Manhattan district attorney's office \"indicate\" he would be arrested on Tuesday. . The district attorney's office has not yet commented. Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said her team had not heard anything from law enforcement officials.. \"Since this is a political prosecution, the district attorney's office has engaged in a practice of leaking everything to the press, rather than communicating with President Trump's attorneys as would be done in a normal case,\" she said. . The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, has hit out at the investigation, calling it \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA [district attorney]\". . In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".. Any indictment would create a complicated calculation for Mr Trump's rivals within the Republican Party, as they decide whether to up their attacks on the former president while he is potentially distracted or keep their heads down and hope for the best. . If history is any guide, it will be the latter.. • . Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and ex-aides Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks, are among those understood to have given evidence so far. The Trump team has said the former president declined an invitation to appear, a sign the case is almost over, according to experts. Reports suggest one final witness could give evidence, possibly on Monday.. • . Once the investigation is complete, the grand jury votes on whether to recommend criminal charges. However, their verdict is not binding. Ultimately, it is up to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to determine what, if any, charges to bring. There is no deadline for this. It is a legal decision - what does he believe can he prove beyond a reasonable doubt to win a conviction - but also a deeply political one.. • . A former US president has never been indicted before but Mr Trump's lawyer said he would follow normal procedure. Typically, a defendant is either arrested or surrenders to the authorities - if they are facing a more serious felony charge they would be handcuffed. They then have their photo and fingerprints taken. After an initial hearing - called an arraignment - a defendant in a white-collar crime case like this is usually released until the next court date.. The Stormy Daniels case is about how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid Ms Daniels $130,000. The record for the payment reimbursing Cohen says the payment was for \"legal fees\". Prosecutors may say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, a misdemeanour in New York.  . US media organisations say law enforcement agencies in New York are preparing for the possibility of Mr Trump being indicted and appearing in a Manhattan courtroom as early as next week.. According to the Associated Press, they are considering the practicalities of taking a former president into court, including questions around security. . Donald Trump faces a separate criminal investigation over efforts to overturn his narrow loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election - though it is not known if the former president is being directly investigated. . The Department of Justice is also looking at whether classified government documents were handled incorrectly after Mr Trump left office, as well as broader efforts to undermine the results of the presidential election three years ago - including the 6 January attack..

        "content": "Women \"upon whom a chemical abortion is performed or attempted\" will not be prosecuted.. As Mark Gordon signed the bill on Friday, a Texas judge was considering a lawsuit that could effectively ban a common abortion pill nationwide.. Abortion pills are the most common method of pregnancy termination in the US.. The Wyoming bill, which was passed by the state's Republican-controlled legislature earlier this month, makes it illegal to \"prescribe, dispense, distribute, sell or use any drug for the purpose of procuring or performing an abortion\". . The law is scheduled to take effect on 1 July.. It does not cover morning-after pills or treatment to protect a woman whose health or life is in danger.. It also exempts treatment of a \"natural miscarriage according to currently accepted medical guidelines\".. Wyoming American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) advocacy director Antonio Serrano criticised the bill, saying \"a person's health, not politics, should guide important medical decisions - including the decision to have an abortion\".. Wyoming only has one clinic that provides abortions - the Women's Health & Family Care Clinic in Jackson.. The state is one of many in which legal fights over abortion bans are ongoing after the Supreme Court reversed the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade judgement legalising abortion.. More than a dozen states have enacted near-total bans on abortions, several of which have been put on hold by the courts. . Mr Gordon, who is a Republican, also said he would allow a separate, wider bill that bans abortion except in limited circumstances to become law on Sunday without his signature. Both this ban and the ban on abortion pills could face challenges in the courts. It is not clear when a wider ban would come into force.. Even more states have placed restrictions on abortion medication, such as requiring an in-person visit to a doctor before obtaining a pill.. Meanwhile in Texas, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, is expected to rule imminently on whether a commonly used abortion pill, . , in a ruling that could curtail access to the drug nationwide.. Mifepristone can be taken at home and is used in more than half of US pregnancy terminations.. The judge is set to rule on a lawsuit filed by an anti-abortion group in Texas arguing that the drug's safety was never properly studied by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves medicines. . President Joe Biden's administration has argued that mifepristone's approval was well supported by science.. ",

Eleven deaths were in El Oro and one in Azuay province, authorities said. . Machala and Cuenca were among the cities that suffered damage to buildings and vehicles, as emergency services rushed to help people.. The epicentre was near Balao, about 50 miles (80km) from Ecuador's second-largest city, Guayaquil, where about three million people live. . \"I went out into the street because I saw people starting to run in panic, getting out of their cars,\" Magaly Escandon, a businessowner in Cuenca, told the AFP news agency. . President Guillermo Lasso asked Ecuadoreans to remain calm as officials assess the damage.. \"Emergency teams are mobilising to offer all their support to those who have been affected,\" he said.. Mr Lasso's office also confirmed that injured people were being treated in hospital, but did not offer any further details. . Several roads have been blocked by landslides, while several homes, educational buildings and health centres have been damaged, authorities said.. One person was reported killed in the city of Cuenca after a wall collapsed onto their car, while three people died when a security camera tower came down on Jambelí Island.. There have also been reports of the earthquake being felt in several other cities, including Manabi, Manta and the capital Quito.. This is the strongest quake to hit Ecuador since 2016, when nearly 700 people died and thousands were injured. . Officials in Peru say the quake was felt in northern regions of the country, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. . ",

        "content": "The claims focus on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow's invasion in 2022.. Moscow has denied the allegations and denounced the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move, as the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects without the co-operation of a country's government. . Russia is not an ICC member country, meaning the court, located in The Hague, has no authority there. . However, it could affect Mr Putin in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally. He could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states. . Mr Putin is only the third president to be issued with an ICC arrest warrant.. President Biden said that, while the court also held no sway in the US, the issuing of the warrant \"makes a very strong point\".. \"He's clearly committed war crimes,\" he told reporters.. His administration had earlier \".  during the conflict in Ukraine, with Vice-President Kamala Harris saying in February that those involved would \"be held to account\". .  earlier this week that found Moscow's forced removal of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounted to a war crime. . In a statement on Friday, the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said the warrants were \"based upon forensic evidence, scrutiny and what's been said by those two individuals\".. The court had initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public to try and stop further crimes being committed.. \"Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported,\" Mr Khan told the BBC. . \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be a human being to know how egregious it is.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. Mr Khan also pointed out that nobody thought that Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, would end up in The Hague to face justice. . \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" Mr Khan said.. Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, who led the prosecution in the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said the warrant would change how foreign leaders view Mr Putin.  . \"He will remain an alleged criminal until and unless he submits himself for trial, or is handed over for trial and acquitted. That seems extremely unlikely, so he will remain an alleged criminal until the end of his life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. Russian opposition activists have welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his thanks to Mr Khan and the ICC for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. ",

The former cricketer-turned-politician has since set off back to his home in Lahore, which police raided in his absence and made arrests.. He denies the charges against him.. The chaotic scenes saw Mr Khan unable to enter the court before the judge agreed that he could mark his attendance and return home.. The ex-PM says the charges against him are politically motivated but says he is attending court \"because I believe in the rule of law\". The government says the charges against him have nothing to do with politics.. He told Reuters that he had formed a committee to lead his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), in the event of his arrest.. About 4,000 security officials, including elite commandos and anti-terrorism squads, have been deployed in Islamabad, AFP reported.. Police blocked the highway into Islamabad with shipping containers and large trucks to stop Mr Khan's convoy as it approached the city. . Officers armed with sticks and tear gas cannisters let his vehicle through, but most of his supporters were turned away.. Speaking to the BBC when the convoy was stationary, Mr Khan said that the authorities were trying to put him in prison to keep him out of the general election race later this year. \"I won't be able to campaign - that's the whole thing,\" he said.. Earlier this week he told the BBC: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". In a sign of the deep divisions within Pakistani politics, the current Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted that Mr Khan's \"antics of the last few days\" had \"laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies\" and accused him of using supporters as \"human shields\".. Earlier in the week Lahore police tried to arrest Mr Khan after he missed a hearing, and officers clashed with supporters outside his home. On Friday, the court granted Mr Khan protection against arrest on the assurance that he would appear in court on Saturday. . On Saturday Lahore police used a digger to gain entry to Mr Khan's residence in an operation involving nearly 1,000 security personnel, according to local media. Police later said they had arrested Khan supporters who had been involved in violence against police earlier in the week, including for throwing petrol bombs.. The Punjab police chief said some officers would remain outside Mr Khan's residence.. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister last April in a no-confidence vote but has kept up pressure on his successor Mr Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He blames Mr Sharif for an assassination attempt at a rally in November in which he was wounded in the leg. Authorities have rejected the accusation.. Mr Khan faces multiple court cases, including terrorism charges. He has cited a variety of reasons - including security concerns and injury from the assassination attempt in November - for not showing up to hearings. . ",
