        "content": "A second woman said she was told to cover up while at an indoor pool in December.. Authorities agreed they had been victims of discrimination and said that all visitors to Berlin's pools were now entitled to go topless.. The decision will be welcomed by those here who champion what's known as . - free body culture.. Foreign visitors to Germany are often surprised - and sometimes downright disconcerted - by the sight of naked Germans frolicking in its lakes, snoring in its parks, or sweating in its saunas. . But this is a country which considers public nudity in some settings to be both appropriate and healthy.. The issue of whether, and to what degree, that is permissible at municipal swimming pools has plagued many a local authority.. Last summer, Göttingen in Lower Saxony and Siegen in North Rhine Westphalia allowed women to swim topless.. Berlin's swimming pool operator, the Berliner Bäderbetriebe (BBB), has not actually changed its rules, which insist that a bathing costume covers the genitals. . The BBB merely clarified that this applies to every visitor, irrespective of their gender.. ",

        "content": "There are fears the vessel could soon break apart or explode, risking one of the worst oil spills in recent memory.. But on Thursday, the UN said it had purchased a crude carrier that would head to Yemen and remove the barrels of oil from the stricken ship.. \"The purchase of this suitable vessel... marks the beginning of the operational phase of the plan to safely remove the oil and avoid the risk of an environmental and humanitarian disaster,\" Achim Steiner from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said, adding that it was a \"major breakthrough\"..  said the ship - which it purchased from major tanker company Euronav - was undergoing routine maintenance in China and would arrive for the operation in early May.. \"A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen's Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions,\" it said.. The organisation added that a potential oil spill could cost up to $20bn (£16.7bn) to clean up.. The UN had been searching for years for a solution and appealed for donations. The planned operation is estimated to cost $129m of which $75m has been received and another $20m has been pledged, it said.. The stranded ship - the FSO Safer - was left abandoned off the port of Hodeida after Yemen's civil war broke out in 2015. It has not been serviced since.. It was constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and converted later into a floating storage for oil. It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.. The 376m (1,233ft) vessel holds an estimated 1.14m barrels of crude oil.. The Safer's structural integrity has deteriorated significantly since maintenance operations were suspended in 2015, when the Houthis seized large parts of Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government. The ensuing conflict has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left more than 23 million in need of aid.. Mr Steiner told reporters on Thursday: \"Let me be very clear - this is a risky operation and things could go wrong.\" He added that it could still be suspended if they fail to raise enough funds..

        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. The attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west, with power blackouts reported in several areas. . Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "The weeks-old protests are some of the biggest Israel has ever seen.. Critics say the reforms will undermine democracy; the government says planned changes are better for the electorate.. In Tel Aviv, thousands of protesters, many waving Israeli flags and carrying signs with slogans against the reforms, marched towards an intersection close to the city's busiest road, the Ayalon highway.. Shay Harel, 64, carried a sign with a target drawn in the middle, which he said was for the \"policemen with the M16 [machineguns]\".. \"Last Wednesday they threw [stun] grenades at me, they hit me with horses - young soldiers who don't know what they're doing,\" he told the BBC.. \"I don't blame them, they get their orders. I blame the Netanyahu family, who are demolishing my country. I won't let it happen, I'm ready to give my life for it. I have written my will,\" he said.. Mr Harel joined protesters who confronted lines of Israeli border patrol officers and mounted police.. The BBC followed hundreds of protesters who broke off from a main march, taking side streets before scaling fences and pouring onto the highway.. There were violent scuffles as lines of officers pushed back protesters. Security forces pinned one man to the ground before detaining him. Another was led away to a police truck as protesters cried \"shame\" at the police.. One protester, Rina Benny, walked along a line of security forces and offered them red roses. None accepted.. \"It's flowers against the guns,\" she told the BBC. \"I was a soldier for many years, and now I am a soldier in the street. I want to save my country for grandchildren... because it was a great democracy and now somebody stole it from us,\" she said.. \"When I was a soldier we knew exactly what we were fighting for. Now I don't know... and we don't know how it's going to end, it's terrible\" she said.. Meanwhile convoys of cars streamed towards the airport from early morning, causing gridlock at the entrance to try to block Mr Netanyahu from getting there by road. He flew in by helicopter instead.. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin landed at the airport on Thursday and was reportedly forced to alter his schedule because of the protests. . In talks with his Israeli counterpart, Mr Austin expressed concern about escalating violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It came hours after three Palestinian militants were killed in a gun-battle with Israeli forces in the town of Jaba. . Israel said the militants had opened fire as an undercover unit carried out an arrest raid. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, said the three had been \"executed\".. Elsewhere in the demonstrations in Israel, students blocked one of the main entrances to the northern port city of Haifa, while in Jerusalem hundreds of military reservists demonstrated outside the offices of a pro-reform right-wing think tank.. Some blocked the entrance to the office with sandbags and seven reservists were arrested, local media reported.. In Israel, military service is compulsory, and most men are required to do reserve duty every year afterwards, mostly up until the age of 40.. The protests against the judicial reforms have been going on for about 10 weeks, bringing at times hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society, and significantly has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. On Monday, in an unprecedented move, . . They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. Mr Netanyahu's government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts over-reaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. ",

        "content": "The morning-after pill was \"part of women's reproductive rights, and not abortive\", she said on social media.. President Castro, who took office in 2022, has promised to relax Honduras's restrictive reproductive rights laws.. \"Today 8 March commemorates women's historic struggle,\" President Castro tweeted. \"I am signing the Executive Order for the universal use of the morning-after pill.\" . She added: \"The World Health Organization determined it is part of women's reproductive rights and not abortive.\". Honduras, a largely Catholic Central American country, banned the use of the morning-after pill following a coup in 2009 that ousted Xiomara Castro's husband, then-President Manuel Zelaya.. Last December, following campaigns from feminist groups, the health ministry approved the use of the pill exclusively for victims of rape.. During an interview for a BBC documentary on black market abortion pills, filmed in July 2022, Honduran Health Secretary Jose Manuel Matheu said that the country would never change its stance on the issue.. \"We are not going to promote the morning-after pill as contraception,\" he said at the time, adding that doing would lead to \"sexual debauchery\". . The term \"desenfreno sexual\" (sexual debauchery) went viral in Honduras on Twitter following the release of the documentary in December, with activists criticising Dr Matheu's choice of words.. On 8 March, Dr Matheu was photographed alongside President Castro signing the executive order - although he did not respond to BBC requests for comment.. Reproductive rights activist Sandy Artega welcomed President Castro's decision, but said there was more work to be done.. \"We will monitor the process of implementing the morning-after pill and we will fight for the other rights that we lack,\" she told the BBC. \"The door is now open for more sexual and reproductive rights.\". Abortion is illegal in all cases in Honduras, punishable by up to six years in prison, even in cases of rape or incest. . According to a UN estimate, between 51,000 and 82,000 unsafe abortions are performed in Honduras each year.. ",
