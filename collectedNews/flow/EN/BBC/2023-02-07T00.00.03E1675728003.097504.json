        "content": "He is also suing his then employer Sama, which Meta had contracted to review posts.. Meta argued that the court had no jurisdiction because the company is not based in Kenya, Reuters reported.. But the court disagreed and found that Meta and Sama were \"proper parties\" to the case.. Meta declined to comment, but legal campaign group Foxglove expected it to appeal.. In 2020, Meta paid $52m to settle a case brought by US content moderators over mental health issues which they said they developed on the job.. The Kenyan case is supported by Foxglove, whose director Cori Crider said that a key point had been established: \"Daniel's win today should send a message to Facebook, and by proxy, all of big tech in Africa. . \"Kenyan justice is equal to any tech giant, and the giants would do well to wake up and respect Kenyan people - and their law.\". Facebook employs thousands of moderators to review content flagged by users or artificial intelligence systems to see if it violates the platform's community standards, and to remove it if necessary.. Mr Motaung said the first graphic video he saw was \"a live video of someone being beheaded\".. He told .  that he suffers flashbacks where he imagines he is the victim.. Mr Motaung, who says he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, believes that his co-workers also struggled with the content they had to view.. \"I would see people walking off the production floor to cry, you know, that type of thing,\" he said.. Mr Motaung was recruited from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi, where much of the moderation for East and South Africa was handled. . He claims the support given to moderators was inadequate.. Sama has called his accusations \"both disappointing and inaccurate\", arguing that it provided all members of its workforce with a competitive wage, benefits, upward mobility, and a robust mental health and wellness programme..  work for Meta. . Meta has previously declined to comment directly on the legal action, but has said it requires partners \"to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support\".. Campaigners say Monday's court ruling could have significance for other cases they are attempting to bring.. In December, a case, also backed by Foxglove, was launched in Kenya, alleging Facebook's algorithm helped fuel the viral spread of hate and violence during Ethiopia's civil war.. The case asks the court to require the creation of a $2bn fund for victims of hate on Facebook and changes to the platform's algorithm.. Meta said that hate speech and incitement to violence were against the platform's rules, and says it invests heavily in moderation and tech to remove such content.. It told the BBC: \"We employ staff with local knowledge and expertise and continue to develop our capabilities to catch violating content in the most widely spoken languages in the country, including Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya.\" .

        "content": "Emergency rescue teams said many buildings are damaged or destroyed and that people remain trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,000 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said that families remain trapped under the rubble. . One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP that he lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble.. \"We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,\" he said. \" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery.\". In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region are beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.. Shajul Islam has worked in the intensive care unit of al-Shifa Hospital in Idlib for the past seven years and told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 the current situation in the hospital is the worst he has ever seen.. He said there are currently two to three patients per bed and that people are being taken off ventilators to give to others who have a better chance of surviving. . Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies. . Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",
