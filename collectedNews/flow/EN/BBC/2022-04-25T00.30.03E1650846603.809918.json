Shanghai's 25 million residents have been shut in their homes for weeks while officials try to contain a severe Covid-19 outbreak.. The .  features audio clips of the local population criticising insufficient food supplies and complaining about poor medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading.. \"This virus can't kill us. Starvation can,\" another man says.. The video, titled The Voice of April, was being widely shared on the popular Chinese platforms Weibo and WeChat.. But on Saturday internet authorities began trying to take it down, battling with rebellious users who were posting new copies elsewhere on the sites.. It's now five weeks since Shanghai's population was first ordered to stay at home as part of an extremely strict lockdown.. The rules are intended by officials to contain the city's latest Covid-19 surge - the most severe wave Shanghai has experienced to date.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites about the poor conditions they were being kept in.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures include .  to prevent those with the virus from leaving and . .. Shanghai city officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. In the viral clip, one woman can be heard complaining that \"even the ceiling isn't finished yet\" at a temporary hospital she was being checked into.. \"Once we arrived, everybody fought for a blanket and a bed,\" she said.. Other residents shout out \"thank you, big whites!\" - a nickname for health officials kitted out in white protective gear while being deployed to Shanghai's various neighbourhoods to enforce lockdown rules.. The attempt to censor the short video has itself caused a debate on Chinese social media, triggering a backlash among commentators.. On Weibo, one of the most popular sites, one user responded: \"The video was just presenting raw facts. There is nothing provocative!\" . \"Its content is nothing new... But the fact of seeing that even that is censored, it bothers me,\" another commentator wrote.. On Saturday, when censors began removing the video, Shanghai officials reported more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases and 12 more deaths in the city.. The Chinese government has pursued a zero-Covid strategy since the beginning of the pandemic, intended to keep the country completely virus free.. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain the more transmissible variants of the virus that have since emerged..

The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money.. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice.. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. . The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109.. \"We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\" he earlier told the AFP news agency.. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency.. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. . The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. . But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country. . What did Putin do before he came to power?.

The Kazu 1 is believed to have been on a three-hour sightseeing voyage around the Shiretoko Peninsula.. The area is a designated UNESCO world heritage site, and boat trips are popular with tourists hoping to spot whales and sea lions as well as brown bears on the rocky beaches.. The crew managed to signal that the vessel was tipping at a 30-degree angle and starting to sink, according to Japanese media.. Patrol boats and police and military aircraft were immediately dispatched to find the vessel. Local fishing boats were also taking part in the search operation.. Of the 26 on board, two were crew and two were children.. Earlier reports suggested that several people were pulled out of the waters - but it is unclear if they are among the confirmed 10 victims.. Waves in the area had been high and local fishing boats had apparently decided to return to port by mid-morning. . The crew reportedly said that all those on board were wearing life jackets. .

        "content": "Women and children in a crowded room can be heard saying they are running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated from the southern city.. Some say they have seen no daylight for weeks, having been there from February.. The BBC has not verified the video, believed to be filmed on 21 April.. On the same day, President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks, and ordered his troops to seal it off instead. . Moscow also declared itself to be in full control of the strategic city - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says Russian troops were simply unable to seize the Azovstal steelworks.. The plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is a huge industrial site in central Mariupol. . Taking the Sea of Azov port - which has been almost erased by weeks of heavy Russian bombardment - is a key Kremlin war aim, and would release more troops to join an ongoing Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. The footage was posted online on 23 April. . The Azov regiment, which was originally a far-right group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard, says it shows its fighters delivering food and other aid to women and children in one of the Azovstal underground bunkers.. Big signs reading \"Children\" in red paint are seen on the walls leading to the room. One woman, who is not named, is heard saying more than 15 children - from babies to those aged 14 - are sheltering there.. Another unnamed woman is seen on camera telling how she has been sheltering since 25 February - the second day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. One of the children, a girl, says she left her house together with her mother and grandmother on 27 February. . \"We haven't seen the sky or the sun since. We want to get out of here very much. We want it to be safe for us, so no-one is hurt, and then live in safety.\". The girl says she wants to be able to go to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where one of her brothers has managed to escape to from Kharkiv - a heavily-bombed city in the north-east.. \"I want to get out… to be in safety. I don't want to risk getting out only to be hit by bomb fragments, for example,\" she adds.. Weaving deep through what the battalion say is the Azovstal steelwork tunnels, the video shows an underground rabbit warren, filled with families and young children. . It is difficult to verify the video, but if accurate it is a rare glimpse of life in the Azovstal plant and a final push by the Azov regiment to ensure that the situation in Mariupol is at the forefront of global attention as the Russian army seal it off. . The Russian media have portrayed their brutal campaign in Mariupol as a way to \"de-Nazify and demilitarise\" Ukraine. This video has been released to replace that image with one of fear and desperation in the eyes of children who say they've not seen the sun in one-and-a-half months, asking to be evacuated. This video is an attempt to control the narrative about what is happening on the ground. . The Azov regiment is controversial; it was originally a far-right group. This video shows them as approachable warriors, fist-bumping children and bringing them supplies, while other images on social media show Russian soldiers standing outside burning buildings and Russian tanks rolling through the city.. Earlier this week, one of the commanders of Azov told the BBC that many civilians, including children, were sheltering at the site. He also said dead Ukrainian fighters were there.. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula, to fight against Russian forces and pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Donbas region. . Some of Azov fighters originally had links to nationalist and far-right groups. The regiment was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. . The regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in Mariupol.. This video can not be played.

For weeks Shanghai's 25 million-strong population has been shut in their homes while officials try to contain the city's worst Covid surge to date.. Images of workers in white hazmat suits sealing entrances to the city's housing blocks and closing off streets with green fencing have spread in recent days on Chinese social media.. Many of the fences, which are around two-metres tall, were installed around buildings designated as \"sealed areas\" where at least one person has tested positive for Covid-19.. Everyone living inside a \"sealed area\" is forbidden from setting foot outside their homes whether or not they have the virus.. It was not immediately clear why officials have began constructing the fences.. A notice dated 23 April from one local authority being shared online said it was imposing \"hard quarantine\" in some areas.. The BBC has not been able to verify these images but has spoken to a foreign national living in Shanghai who said green fencing appeared in his own residential complex three days ago.. The resident, who asked not to be identified, said that the main gate to his compound was chained up three weeks ago after he believes one of his neighbours tested positive for the virus.. But on Thursday he said workers installed a new barrier without any warning. . \"There is a long corridor in our compound, and within the long corridor they put up another green fence three days ago,\" he described on the phone. \"No one told us the reason it was installed.\". \"No one can get out,\" he said. \"I feel helpless. You don't know when the lockdown is going to end.\". \"If your area gets fenced off, what if a fire breaks out? I don't think anyone in their right mind can seal people's homes,\" he said.. While some city officials have been installing fences, others have been busy trying to block a popular video . .. The six-minute montage features unverified audio clips of the local population criticising inadequate food supplies and complaining about medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading in the video..
