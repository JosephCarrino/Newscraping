        "content": "It's why he and his family are moving out of the flat they've lived in for the last 15 years. The whole building has been condemned after failing an earthquake safety test. There's a very high chance that a tremor would bring this whole block crashing to the ground. . Here in Istanbul, fear is growing. . The two powerful earthquakes in Turkey's south that claimed almost 50,000 lives have brought a new urgency to its biggest city. Home to 15 million people, it sits on the North Anatolian fault line, and experts predict it's due its own major earthquake before 2030. . Around 70% of the city's buildings were built before rule changes that enforced stricter construction standards in 1999, and so are considered potentially unsafe. Just three months ago, a study said a quake here could kill up to 90,000 people. Now, the race is on to get the city ready.. Mesut knows all too well the devastation a quake can cause. He's just returned from the epicentre in the southern city of Kahramanmaras, where he lost relatives. As we talked in his now-empty flat, he described the moment he found out. . \"It happened at 04:17, a relative called and we all woke up screaming.\" Mesut's face crumples into tears and he turns away to compose himself. \"It's a horrible situation. We couldn't get [to Kahramanmaras] for three days because of snow, and when we reached the rubble it was so hard. I can't describe it. I hope God doesn't make anyone else experience this.\". When Mesut returned to Istanbul, the authorities had shut off power and water to his flat. \"I asked for them back again just so we could move. They gave me two more days.\". \"The municipality had sent us written warning about it, but the situation wasn't resolved due to rejections from the neighbours. We knew that our utilities were going to be shut off, and we were ready to leave here, but then the quake happened and it all became a shambles.\". Since the earthquakes in the south, there've been more than 100,000 new applications to the Istanbul municipality for building safety checks. The waiting list for one shot up to three months, then four, and it keeps rising. . Tenants as well as landlords can now apply, but some still don't because of the financial implications. The compensation to help those who need to move out of condemned buildings is low. There are no official numbers showing how many fail the test. . The city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has promised more training for rescue teams, and preparation of temporary shelters that could house up to 4.5 million people in the aftermath of a quake. But many fear it still isn't enough.. A walk down an average Istanbul street tells you why. Many of the buildings have particular design features that can make them collapse if they're put under pressure during a quake. . Dr Kurtulus Atasever, a structural and earthquake engineer, met me to point some of them out. We stood on an empty patch of ground, strewn with rocks, that used to be the foundations of a building. When a magnitude 5.8 quake hit Istanbul in 2019, it was so badly damaged it had to be knocked down. Up and down the street, its neighbours have many of the same flaws.. Good quality concrete is vital, he tells me. And the architecture is crucial. \"We have some overhangs here. In this type of building we have some weak or soft storeys. There are short columns too, they are actually all typical building problems.\" . In very simple terms, each of them weakens a building at ground level, meaning it struggles to hold up the floors above if there's an earthquake. An overhang makes the rest of the building wider than the footprint. Soft storeys are where the ground floor is taller than the floors above it. Short columns don't have enough length compared to their diameter. . They can be done safely, Dr Atasever points out, but only if proper thought and planning has gone into the design. In old buildings especially, that's rare. . We're standing in the shadow of Yasemin Suleymanoglu's house, and I ask if she's concerned about the apartment block it's in. She holds her daughter's hand and looks up at the face of the building. \"I don't feel safe here,\" she says. . \"Our building shook a lot during the 2019 earthquake, and the columns of the one across the street cracked. I've been feeling restless since that sound, and with this latest quake we are really scared. We're losing our sleep because it may hit us any time. And I think we're at risk because our building is old.\" . The next step is the development of a 50km (31-mile) long fibre-optic based early warning system. But for a city so huge, it's hard to know where people would go to seek shelter, even if they had notice that a quake was coming.. As pictures of the devastation in the south continue to fill Turkish TV screens, these concerns are now front-of-mind for a huge slice of Istanbul's population. And just two months away from important presidential and parliamentary elections, that really matters. . Overnight, the earthquake and its aftermath have joined Turkey's economic crisis as a key issue for voters. Many aren't happy with the government's handling of either. The aftershocks here aren't just physical, they're political too. . ",

The UN says the conflict forced 300,000 people from their homes last month.. This happened in North-Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and Uganda, and is a fertile and mountainous area long plundered by rival groups.. There is increasing concern about the humanitarian crisis caused by the fighting, which was still ongoing on Friday.  . The European Union has just started an operation to fly in aid to the regional capital, Goma, saying humanitarian agencies have become overwhelmed.. A statement from the Angolan president's office said the soldiers would be deployed to help secure areas that have been held by the M23 rebel group and to protect ceasefire monitors. . Kenyan soldiers, who are part of the East African Community Regional Force, have deployed to these areas too.. The rebels, who are widely reported to be backed by Rwanda, had just hours earlier said they would withdraw from several captured villages. . The Congolese government will welcome the arrival of Angolan troops to help in the fight against the rebels.. But there is a danger of this becoming a wider international conflict.. More than 20 years ago the armies of at least eight African countries fought a war in eastern DR Congo, dubbed . , that caused immense suffering for the civilian population.  . Rwanda has for many years criticised the Congolese authorities for failing to disarm Hutu rebels - some of whom are linked to the Rwandan genocide in 1994.. It denies backing the M23, which has captured vast swathes of territory over the past year and has been advancing towards Goma.. A decade ago, M23 fighters also captured large parts of North Kivu - but were eventually routed by UN and regional troops and as part of a peace deal disarmed. . They began regrouping early last year.. Largely made up of Congolese army deserters, they first took up arms in 2009 accusing the government of marginalising the country's ethnic Tutsi minority and failing to honour previous peace accords..

Critics say the reforms will undermine democracy.. But Benjamin Netanyahu's government says planned changes are better for the electorate.. Organisers said as many as 500,000 pro-democracy protesters took to the streets nationwide on Saturday, in what the Israeli Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".. Opposition leader Yair Lapid told crowds in the southern city of Be'er Sheva that the country was facing \"the greatest crisis in its history\". . \"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday a new agreement with Saudi Arabia. But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.. Tamir Guytsabry, a protester in Tel Aviv, told Reuters: \"It's not a judicial reform. It's a revolution that [is] making Israel go to full dictatorship and I want Israel to stay a democracy for my kids.\". The protests against the judicial reforms have brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets.. The reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. On Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.. The government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "It was signed by the \"Scorpions Group\", a splinter faction of the powerful Gulf Cartel. . The letter points to the strange, misplaced sense of civic duty which many Mexican cartels claim to possess. Despite the widespread fear they sow through extortion, murder and kidnapping, groups like the Gulf Cartel and their rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel, profess a twisted code of ethics under which they believe they are looking out for the most vulnerable in Mexican society.  . That warped understanding of compassion and altruism does not extend to undocumented migrants, who are routinely kidnapped, raped and murdered. Nor are local businesses exempt from paying \"el piso\", an extortion for merely operating on their territory, the tax applied to everyone from multinational companies to small, family-run convenience stores. . Yet, there is a logic to the cartel's code of behaviour, particularly in remote and rural parts of Mexico and poor mountainous communities, where organised crime often fills the role left by the state.  . This video can not be played. Watch: The Mexican kidnapping saga explained in 80 seconds. One need only look at their response after natural disasters. When hurricanes or earthquakes hit the western state of Guerrero, criminal gangs distributed emergency supplies and bags of food, even stamped with their cartel's distinctive initials. A similar phenomenon was seen during the worst moments of the Covid lockdowns too.  . The cartels also consider themselves the maintainers of community order, handing out brutal summary justice to child rapists or thieves who operate outside their purview. They are the judge, jury and executioners, often quite literally.  . In that context, the decision to hand over their own gunmen after the debacle in Matamoros adds up: A mistake happened, an apology was made, and the culprits handed in. Case closed.  . And even Mexican drug cartels are aware of the power of good PR. . That sense of neatly curtailing the chaos while apologising to the city's residents must also be taken with a huge pinch of salt, however. . How can one be sure these five men were the perpetrators? Who can be trusted to be telling the truth? The drug cartel? The state Attorney General's office? In waters as murky and muddied as those of Tamaulipas state, the wisest instinct is generally to question anything one is told.  . Lest we forget, Mexico's former Public Security Secretary, Genaro Garcia Luna, who was once the highest official in law enforcement and the man who led the war against drugs, is currently languishing in a US prison having been found guilty of working alongside the Sinaloa Cartel in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes.  . This video can not be played. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. In the Matamoros case, authorities in Mexico have been highlighting the victims' criminal records in their statements to the media. . We were initially told the Americans were in town for health tourism - a cheap Mexican tummy tuck that went about as badly wrong as possible.  . A day later, as allegations began to swirl, a member of the Mexican government forwarded me a story about the victims' criminal past, specifically that one had a conviction for manufacturing illegal narcotics with an intent to supply.  . \"Just checking you'd seen this\", went the innocuous comment.   . Whether that was part of a concerted push in Mexico to victim-blame or because there is hard evidence to suggest the kidnapping was targeted is again hard to know. . One thing that the entire mess has reminded me of was one of my own trips to Tamaulipas shortly after arriving in Mexico in 2011. It taught me something critical about the drug war in Mexico which has stayed with me to this day. . In a non-descript hotel room, I met the girlfriend of a member of the Zetas, a particularly bloodthirsty cartel which today is largely disbanded. As we filmed her in the shadows, her name changed and her voice disguised, she described what her boyfriend did. Without naming the exact organisation, it was clear he worked in law enforcement yet was also a member of the Zetas.  . A cop by day, a narco by night. . \"What you're telling me\", I asked naively, \"is that the relationship between the cartels and the state is very close?\" . \"No\", came her chilling reply, \"I'm saying the cartels are the state.\" .
