The Indian Air Force has tweeted pictures of the boxed animals arriving \"after a 10-hour flight from Johannesburg\".. They were then flown by helicopter to Kuno National Park.. These big cats will join eight received from Namibia last year.. Earlier this week, Uttam Sharma, director of Kuno National Park, said the big cats will be placed in quarantine enclosures upon their arrival.. The 12 cheetahs have been living in quarantine in South Africa since July.. Wildlife experts have raised concerns about the long quarantine periods the cheetahs are being subjected to, and say that it could harm their health and fitness.. However, Mr Sharma said that all preparations to receive the big cats \"had been completed\".. Proponents of the project say that the reintroduction of cheetahs will build up local economies and help restore ecosystems that support the big cats.. But some worry that relocation of animals is always fraught with risks and releasing the cheetahs into a park might put them in harm's way.. ",

        "content": "It comes after Pyongyang showed off its massive military might in a parade that included more than a dozen ICBMs.. On Friday, North Korea threatened to unleash an \"unprecedentedly strong\" retaliation to any military drills between South Korea and the US.. The annual springtime exercises, which are due to start next month, are designed to help fend off North Korea's increasing nuclear threats. But Pyongyang has long insisted the drills are in preparation to invade North Korea.. Saturday's missile, which is the first to be launched since new year's day, splashed down west of Hokkaido, in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) at 18:27 (09:27 GMT), Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. An EEZ is an area of the sea that a country has jurisdiction over. Japan's is a 200-nautical mile area off its coast.. It landed some 900km (560 miles) away, and reached an altitude of 5,700km, government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno said in Tokyo. While that is incredibly high - the edge of space is about 100km - it is not the highest a North Korean missile has flown.. In November, an ICBM reached an altitude of 6,100km. Previously, in January 2022, .  of the Earth that it claimed were taken from a missile launch that reached 2,000km.. ICBMs are particularly worrying because of their long range, including mainland United States.  . Japan's Defence Minister Hamada Yasukazu said Saturday's missile would have been able to do this, with a possible range of 14,000km.. \"This series of actions by North Korea threatens the peace and stability of Japan and the international community, and is absolutely unforgivable,\" Mr Matsuno said.. South Korea's military reported the missile was launched from the Sunan district, north of Pyongyang, where the international airport is located. It is also where North Korea has launched most of its recent ICBM tests.. North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are banned by the UN Security Council. But this has not stopped Pyongyang from continuing with its weapons development, and holding elaborate military parades to show them off.. Just over a week ago, .  in a midnight military parade which was attended by leader Kim Jong-un.. ",

However not everyone associated with the film, Navalny, have been excluded from the ceremony. Bafta confirmed to PA news agency that several producers will be there.. Mr Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group, and is credited with helping to expose the . .. In the film, Mr Grozev is shown uncovering details that suggest involvement in the poisoning plot by the Kremlin. Russia denies any involvement in the attack, which reportedly involved lacing Mr Navalny's underwear with poison.. On Twitter, Mr Grozev wrote that he had been \"banned by British police\" from attending the awards ceremony - although the Metropolitan Police said they had no power to do this, and it would be up to the event organisers. It does, however, give advice to event organisers on security matters.. Mr Grozev said he only found out that he and his son and been disinvited when he received a message by someone from CNN a few days ago. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they had tickets to the event, but the invite was withdrawn based on advice from UK police.. The ban was down to \"concerns about public safety and security,\" he was told, but was given no more information on what those risks were.. Mr Grozev added, however, that in recent weeks he has received \"numerous alerts from different law enforcement agencies around Europe that there is credible evidence that my life is in danger\".. The Metropolitan Police said .  that threats by foreign states to journalists in the UK are \"a reality that we are absolutely concerned with\".. It added that it recognised its advice on security measures could mean \"organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event\". . Bafta said in comments cited by PA news agency that the safety of its guests and staff was a priority, adding that it had \"robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.\". ",

        "content": "The letter threatened to sue the woman and her parents for $300m (£249m) if she did not retract her statements.. A lawyer for the Tates said they were pursuing valid claims for defamation.. The BBC has seen a redacted copy of the letter, apparently sent on behalf of the brothers.. \"In April 2022,\" it reads, \"you falsely stated to a third party that our Client human trafficked you, abused you and held you against your will […] You have repeated false and defamatory statements to the police, the media, and another United States citizen about the Tate brothers.\". Andrew and Tristan Tate are currently being held in preventative custody in Romania, while police investigate allegations of trafficking and rape, which both men deny.. Benjamin Bull - who works for the National Centre on Sexual Exploitation - says his client is a key witness in the Romanian investigation, and that the letter was designed to do \"one thing and one thing only\":. \"[It] was intended to shut down the witness; stop the witness from bringing testimony forward in any proceedings,\" he said. . \"They want these young ladies to climb into a hole and hide, never come forward [or] describe what they saw and what happened to them. It's clearly an effort to intimidate.\". Lawyers for the Tates have confirmed to the BBC that the cease-and-desist letter was sent in December, as a civil matter for defamation and slander in the US, but deny any intimidation.. Tina Glandian, one of their legal advisors, said there was nothing abnormal in them pursuing valid legal claims for defamation. \"The fact that [the Tates] are incarcerated right now is not a basis for them not to pursue their legal rights,\" she said.. The investigation into rape and trafficking allegations is believed to rest, at least partly, on the testimony of six women.  No charges have yet been brought.. The Tates' legal team have also revealed that the brothers filed criminal complaints in Romania last April against two women, including the witness who received the cease-and-desist letter in December.. Ms Glandian said the criminal complaints in April were filed in response to allegations that two women were being held against their will by the Tate brothers. . \"There was no evidence whatsoever of that,\" she said, \"which is why [the Tates] were not arrested in April.  [At that time], they were nothing but victims of false allegations, and they had every right to file criminal complaints for having their homes raided [and] property seized.\". The results of those criminal complaints are still pending, she says.. Benjamin Bull, who represents some of the witnesses in the current Tate investigation, says the impact of legal action on his clients has been upsetting and intimidating.. But Dani Pinter, part of the same legal team, says it is not just the threat of legal action that is intimidating, but the online harassment many of her clients receive for speaking out.. \"Regular, high production value videos, meant to embarrass and harass them, are shared among Tate's followers,\" she told me. . \"Making really salacious claims, attempting to slut shame them, saying they're liars. But included in that is their private information - where they work, who their family members are - with the clear intention to incite harassment.  And it's working.\". The two alleged victims she represents have been getting death threats, she says. . \"They're scared to death. They're both in hiding. They feel they can't settle anywhere, because people are trying to find them.\". Prosecutors have been careful to keep the names of the six women in their case strictly confidential. But some have had their full names published on social media. . And the names of two witnesses even appeared in a statement to the BBC from the Tates' US communications team. The BBC is not naming them publicly.. Andrew Tate and his brother have no access to their social media while in custody, but they've built a vast and loyal network of fans and supporters who are very active online.. Some accounts appear to be fully-staffed operations, regularly releasing videos and documents designed to undermine the testimony of witnesses and other women making allegations against the Tates.. Earlier this week, one of the most active accounts published the full name, social media handles and WhatsApp messages of one of the alleged victims in the investigation.. The BBC has approached the account for comment, but has not yet received a response.. Even those who barely break the surface of this story can find themselves a target.. Daria Gusa spoke to the BBC and others about receiving a private message from Andrew Tate's Instagram account when she was 16 years old.  It followed the same pattern laid out by him in online speeches about how to win a woman's attention and gain influence over her.. She did not allege that he had committed any crime.. \"I got a bunch of messages,\" she told me. \"Most were from people saying I was lying or calling me a slut.\". But she also received \"10 to 15 threats\" online.. \"I had a guy texting me, telling me 'I know you're studying at this university, the schedule is published online, I know where you are'\" Daria said.. Several of her friends, who also appear to have had contact with him, have refused to speak out about their experiences, she says.. \"It's not just the people who work for him,\" she explained. \"It's that there are basically millions of men out there who really idolise these people, and would do anything to protect them and their image, so I think it's completely justifiable that so many girls don't want to speak out.\". It is not clear exactly who runs some of the most active accounts defending the Tates, or how much cooperation exists between them.. But the risks for women making public allegations against Andrew Tate can be high, and they can come from many directions.. ",
