In nearby Syria, relief efforts have been complicated by years of conflict that has destroyed the nation's infrastructure.. The Bab al-Hawa crossing between Turkey and Syria has been closed since the earthquake as the roads were badly damaged.. While a senior UN official said the road may soon be accessible, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the country was working to open two more border gates to help get aid into the country.. \"There are some difficulties in terms of Turkey's and the international community's aid [reaching Syria]. For this reason, efforts are being made to open two more border gates,\" he said.. The EU has confirmed it will send €3.5m (£3.1m) in aid to Syria following a government request for assistance, but said the aid must be delivered to both government- and rebel-controlled areas.. More than 1,500 people have died in Idlib province alone and an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said sanctions were stopping Syria from receiving the aid it needed.. \"We don't have enough bulldozers, we do not have enough cranes, we do not have enough oil due to European and American sanctions,\" Bouthaina Shabban said. .

        "content": "Prosecutors said there was evidence that Mr Putin decided to provide heavy weaponry to Moscow-backed separatists.. There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down.. The conclusions of the Joint Investigation Team - made up of investigators from five countries - follow a Dutch court ruling from last year which found .  in absentia.. Moscow - which has denied all involvement in the downing of the plane - dismissed those verdicts as \"scandalous\" and politically motivated. . The international team, charged with looking into those responsible for launching the missile, said on Wednesday it had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings.. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries.. The Joint Investigation Team cited the Dutch court which last year ruled that Moscow had \"overall control\" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014.. It described recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said the decision to provide military support \"rests with the President\".. \"There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,\" it said. . But it added it was not known whether the request \"explicitly mentions\" the system used to shoot down MH17.. \"Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,\" investigators said. . \"Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State.\". The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is made up of members from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - the countries worst affected by the shooting down of MH17.. The team wanted to prove the identities of the missile's crew members, and who was in the chain of command, but admitted that was not possible for now.. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said: \"We will seek to employ all the existing international legal mechanisms to bring [Mr Putin] to justice\" over MH17. . Piet Ploeg lost his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew on MH17. He said he was glad prosecutors had laid out their evidence for Mr Putin's involvement.. \"All the news we heard about Putin and his personal involvement in the downing on MH17 - facilitating with heavy weapons, the fact he decided personally to hand over heavy arms … we always thought he did, but now we heard he did,\" he told the BBC.. \"He can't be prosecuted for it because he's a head of state, but the world knows.\". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was \"now clear\" Vladimir Putin was involved in the tragedy.. This fitted the pattern of a man and country \"only concerned with trying to slow things down, spread falsehoods, injustice and of course a terrible form of aggression since the war in Ukraine\", he said.. Mr Rutte added he was bitterly disappointed there was not enough evidence to warrant further prosecutions, but insisted that did not mean the criminal justice process was over..

Last month the Tesla and SpaceX boss said Twitter had about 2,300 employees - down from around 8,000 when he took over. . For months experts have been warning that such deep cuts could cause technical issues, though it is not yet clear if the reduced headcount was to blame for Wednesday's outage. . It appears part of the outage was soon fixed, with many users reporting they could tweet.  . Some reported being notified by Twitter that they were over the 2,400-tweet-per-day limit, even if they had not posted on Wednesday.. Account holders had also reported problems with Twitter messages. Several users said they could not access TweetDeck - a dashboard that can be used with Twitter. . It's not yet clear how many people were affected. . \"Twitter may not be working as expected for some of you. Sorry for the trouble. We're aware and working to get this fixed,\" Twitter said. . In recent weeks many users have complained of bugs while using Twitter - including some claiming they could increase the reach of tweets if they locked their accounts. .

Onlookers including family, friends and neighbours of the building's residents stopped talking, while cranes and other machinery nearby were switched off.. After minutes of silence, rescuers called out for an ambulance, confirming that a woman had been found alive. . The crowd broke into cheers and tears. . One woman, whose cousin and aunt lived in the building and are still missing, fell back onto a car bonnet and buried her face in her hands.. Onlookers told the BBC it marked the first time a survivor had been found at the six-storey apartment block since Monday's earthquake reduced it to rubble.. Shortly before they were found, a body had been pulled from the debris just a few metres away.. Rescue workers and volunteers quickly formed a chain to carry the woman to a waiting ambulance.. Local residents said she was a single mother in her 50s who lived alone in the building. Her son stood by the ambulance and watched as she was carried down, they added. . Several onlookers said it gave them renewed hope that their own missing loved ones would be found. One said she was hoping for a \"miracle\".. Rescue workers hugged as the woman was taken away - a rare moment of hope and happiness among so much devastation.. The mood at the Iskenderun apartment block quickly became sombre again as rescuers resumed the slow work of searching the rubble, largely by hand.. Local doctor Mehmet Riyat told the BBC medical staff had been overwhelmed since Monday.. \"We've had patients who have been crushed. We've seen lots of broken bones, broken necks, head injuries. And lots of deaths,\" he said.. \"As doctors we have to do our jobs. But when the support teams take over, then we think about our own families.\".

Critics have said emergency efforts have been too slow and that not enough was done to prepare the earthquake-prone region by his government..

He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull.. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol.. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an \"anti-Russian state\", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died. . Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon). . He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist. . The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline.. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired into the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances.. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed.. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them.. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, \"when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless\"..
