        "content": "He commanded an anti-drone unit in occupied Luhansk, but had also been one of the founders of a mercenary group fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014. . He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull.. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol.. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an \"anti-Russian state\", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died. . Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon). . He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist. . The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline.. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired into the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances.. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed.. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them.. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, \"when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless\"..

        "content": "Prosecutors said there was evidence that Mr Putin decided to provide heavy weaponry to Moscow-backed separatists.. There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down.. The conclusions of the Joint Investigation Team - made up of investigators from five countries - follow a Dutch court ruling from last year which found .  in absentia.. Moscow - which has denied all involvement in the downing of the plane - dismissed those verdicts as \"scandalous\" and politically motivated. . The international team, charged with looking into those responsible for launching the missile, said on Wednesday it had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings.. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries.. The Joint Investigation Team cited the Dutch court which last year ruled that Moscow had \"overall control\" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014.. It described recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said the decision to provide military support \"rests with the President\".. \"There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,\" it said. . But it added it was not known whether the request \"explicitly mentions\" the system used to shoot down MH17.. \"Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,\" investigators said. . \"Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State.\". The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is made up of members from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - the countries worst affected by the shooting down of MH17.. The team wanted to prove the identities of the missile's crew members, and who was in the chain of command, but admitted that was not possible for now.. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said: \"We will seek to employ all the existing international legal mechanisms to bring [Mr Putin] to justice\" over MH17. . Piet Ploeg lost his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew on MH17. He said he was glad prosecutors had laid out their evidence for Mr Putin's involvement.. \"All the news we heard about Putin and his personal involvement in the downing on MH17 - facilitating with heavy weapons, the fact he decided personally to hand over heavy arms â€¦ we always thought he did, but now we heard he did,\" he told the BBC.. \"He can't be prosecuted for it because he's a head of state, but the world knows.\". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was \"now clear\" Vladimir Putin was involved in the tragedy.. This fitted the pattern of a man and country \"only concerned with trying to slow things down, spread falsehoods, injustice and of course a terrible form of aggression since the war in Ukraine\", he said.. Mr Rutte added he was bitterly disappointed there was not enough evidence to warrant further prosecutions, but insisted that did not mean the criminal justice process was over.. In January, .  against Russia over the downing of MH17.. ",
