        "content": "Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. A local official says . .. But Deputy Mayor Oleksandr Marchenko said at the weekend that Russia had not yet gained control of the city.. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner private army involved in the Russian campaign, .  amid apparent friction between his fighters and regular Russian forces. . He also says his representative had been barred from a Russian military headquarters.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin. . Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine it annexed last September after referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Mr Zelensky said in his evening address that he had discussed Bakhmut with senior generals..  \"[They] responded not to withdraw, but to strengthen [our defences],\" he said..  \"The command unanimously supported this position. There were no other positions. I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut.\". The comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that armed forces commander Valery Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.. Most defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.. And at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were .  while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.. Ground forces commander Olexandr Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".. \"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\".

It is much smaller than the famous Sphinx in the Pyramids of Giza, which is 20m (66ft) high.. The artefacts were found inside a two-level tomb in the temple of Dendera in Qena Province, 450km (280 miles) south of the capital of Cairo.. Emperor Claudius, whom archaeologists believe the statue's smiling features may belong to, extended Roman rule into North Africa between 41 and 54 AD.. Archaeologists will study the markings on the stone slab, which could reveal more information on the statue's identity, the ministry said.. Beside the \"beautifully and accurately carved\" sphinx, archaeologists also found a Roman-era stone slab with demotic and hieroglyphic inscriptions.. The limestone shrine includes a two-layer platform and a mud-brick basin from the Byzantine era.. Some experts see these discoveries by the Egyptian government as a way of attracting more tourists, to revive its tourism industry amid a severe economic crisis in Egypt.. ",

        "content": "Mr Musk responded by asking: \"What work have you been doing?\". Halli Thorleifsson told the BBC that nine days after being frozen out of Twitter's accounts he did not know whether he had been fired or not.. After a series of follow up questions and answers with Mr Musk, that read like a live interview for his job, Mr Thorleifsson said he received an email confirming that he had been sacked.. Twitter did immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.. Mr Thorleifsson, 45, was a senior director in product design for Twitter. He told the BBC the ambiguity around his job was \"strange\" and \"extremely stressful\".. \"I opened my computer on Sunday morning nine days ago and saw that the screen was grey and locked, indicating that I had been locked out of my Twitter accounts\", he said.. \"After a few days had passed I started reaching out to people, including Elon and the head of HR to ask about my situation.. \"The head of HR has since twice emailed me and has not been able to answer whether or not I am an employee at Twitter.\" . Frustrated, he tweeted his top boss, Elon Musk.. \"Maybe if enough people retweet you'll answer me here\", Mr Thorleifsson. . Mr Musk responded:. After several follow up questions Mr Thorleifsson supplied a list of things he had done at the company. The exchange ended with Mr Musk posting two laughing emojis.. Shortly after that exchange Mr Thorleifsson said that Twitter's Human Resources department had contacted him and said that he had been fired. . The Iceland-based entrepreneur had sold his company, Ueno, a creative design agency, to Twitter in early 2021 - after founding the firm in Reykjavik in 2014. . As part of the acquisition he became a full-time employee at Twitter.. \"I decided to sell for a few reasons but one of them is that I have muscular dystrophy and my body is slowly but surely failing me,\" he told the BBC. . \"I have a few good work years left in me so this was a way to wrap up my company, and set up myself and my family for years when I won't be able to do as much.\" . Mr Thorleifsson is worried that Mr Musk will not honour the contract he signed with Twitter when he sold them his company. . \"This is extremely stressful. This is my retirement fund, a way to take care of myself and my family as my disease progresses. Having the richest man in the world on the other end of this, potentially refusing to stand by contracts is not easy for me to accept,\" he said. . Last month, Elon Musk appeared to fire another 200 Twitter employees. It means that Twitter now has just over 2,000 workers - down from approximately 7,500 in October. . \"Companies let people go, that's within their rights,\" Mr Thorleifsson said. \"They usually tell people about it but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now\"..

The United Airlines flight was due to land in less than an hour when flight crew in the cockpit saw an alert that a door had been \"disarmed\", charging documents said.. A flight attendant was asked to investigate and discovered the door's lock handle had been moved from the fully locked position and its emergency slide disarmed.. Cabin crew quickly suspected Mr Torres had moved the handle as he had been seen loitering by the door earlier.. When an attendant confronted him, Mr Torres allegedly asked if there were cameras in the area around the door.. Following the interaction, the attendant is said to have told the captain the passenger \"posed a threat to the aircraft and that the captain needed to land the aircraft as soon as possible\", according to charging documents summarised . .. Soon after, Mr Torres got out of his seat and began walking towards the flight attendants before lunging at one \"with a broken metal spoon, hitting the flight attendant on the neck area three times\", the summary said.. Passengers on-board tackled Mr Torres after he attacked the flight attendant, it added.. Mr Torres had apparently been acting oddly, even asking a fellow passenger where the emergency exit was located during take-off.. According to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, Mr Torres told police he thought the flight attendant had been going to kill him. . The flight was able to land safely and United Airlines thanked the \"quick action\" of crew and customers.. Mr Torres has been banned from flying on United. .

More than one million people are expected at demonstrations in Paris and other cities.. With the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader has said there is talk is of escalation and \"bringing the country to its knees\".. In the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes in key sectors like power generation and gas terminals.. So far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy, and in the meantime the bill is proceeding through parliament.. Unions and the left know time is running out before the reform becomes a fait accompli - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now.. The majority of French citizens back the ongoing strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform, a poll by French survey group Elabe suggests.. According to the opinion poll, 56% of people support rolling strikes and 59% back the call to bring the country to a standstill.. Two-thirds of people support the protest movement against the government's planned pension reforms in general, the poll indicates.. President Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council.. Government spokesman Olivier Véran told France 2: \"We don't want French people to be, quote, unquote, 'victims' of a long-term blockade.\". Last week, he warned that the strikes could lead to an \"ecological, agricultural and health catastrophe\".. More than 260 demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday, with up to 1.4 million people expected to attend, a police source told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity.. Neighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age to 65 or above to reflect longer life expectancy.. ",
