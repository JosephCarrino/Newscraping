        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. The vessel reportedly broke apart while trying to land with about 150 people aboard near the coastal town of Crotone in the Calabria region.. Many bodies have been recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort. . Large numbers of people fleeing conflict and poverty make the crossing from Africa to Italy each year.. Local officials put the confirmed death toll in the latest tragedy to strike the central Mediterranean at either 58 or 59. . Earlier the coastguard said 80 people had been recovered alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . Manuela Curra, a local government official, told Reuters news agency that the boat had left the Turkish coastal city of Izmir three or four days ago.. Those onboard were mainly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran, according to Italian officials, and President Sergio Mattarella said many were fleeing \"very difficult conditions\". . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said. . The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that has been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, has told Rai News. . Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" for the incident, blaming the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

        "content": "Moscow said \"anti-Russian\" Western countries had \"destabilised\" the G20.. It comes after China this week published a plan to end the conflict that was viewed by some as pro-Russian. . India, which hosted this week's G20 talks in the southern city of Bengaluru, issued a wide-ranging \"chair's summary\" from the meeting, noting there were \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine, and on sanctions imposed on Russia.. A footnote said that two paragraphs summarising the war were \"agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China\". The paragraphs were adapted from the G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration in November, and criticised \"in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine\".. After taking a back seat since the invasion a year ago, Beijing has stepped up its diplomacy efforts surrounding the conflict in recent weeks. Its top diplomat Wang Yi toured Europe this week, . China also this week published a 12-point plan for ending the war in Ukraine, in which it called for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty. However, the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and did not condemn Russia's invasion.. The Chinese document was welcomed by Russia, prompting US President Joe Biden to comment: \"[President] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?\". After the G20 meeting, Ajay Seth, a senior Indian official, said in a press conference that Russian and Chinese representatives did not agree to the wording on Ukraine because \"their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues\". . \"On the other hand, all the other 18 countries felt that the war has got implications for the global economy\" and needed to be mentioned, he added. . The 17-paragraph summary of the summit also referenced the recent earthquake in Turkey, debt in low- and middle-income countries, global tax policy, and food insecurity.. Russia's foreign ministry said it regretted the fact that \"the activities of the G20 continue to be destabilised by the Western collective and used in an anti-Russian... way\". . It accused the United States, European Union and G7 nations of \"clear blackmail\", urging them to \"acknowledge the objective realities of a multipolar world\". . But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: \"This is a war. And this war has a cause, has one cause, and that is Russia and Vladimir Putin. That must be expressed clearly at this G20 finance meeting.\" . Previous meetings of G20 members have also failed to produce a joint statement since Russia invaded Ukraine last February. . On Thursday, the UN General Assembly in New York . . The motion was backed by 141 nations with 32 abstaining and seven - including Russia - voting against.. ",
