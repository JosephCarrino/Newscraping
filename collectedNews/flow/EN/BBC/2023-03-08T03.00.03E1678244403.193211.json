        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Four US citizens were kidnapped by armed men on 3 March while driving into the city of Matamoros in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, across the border from Texas. . They had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.  . One man, named only as José \"N\", 24, from Tamaulipas, has been arrested.. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \"We offer our deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who were killed in these attacks.\". The two surviving victims were delivered to the US on Tuesday in co-operation with the US consulate in Matamoros, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica . .. The FBI later confirmed that two Americans were found dead and that the other two have been brought to American hospitals for treatment. . \"One of the surviving victims sustained serious injuries during the attack,\" the FBI said. . The statement added that the agency will work with international partners and other law enforcement agencies to \"hold those responsible for this horrific and violent attack accountable for their crimes.\"   . The bodies of those killed have been recovered and are being repatriated, US officials said.. \"We are very sorry that this happened in our country and we send our condolences to the families of the victims, friends, and the United States government, and we will continue doing our work to guarantee peace and tranquillity,\" Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said.. The Americans were named as Latavia \"Tay\" McGee, Shaeed Woodard, Eric James Williams and Zindell Brown, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.. The four were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said this week.. Video shows them being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men. One is manhandled onto the vehicle while others appear to be unconscious and are dragged to the truck.. A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander, was killed in last Friday's incident.. At a news conference later on Tuesday, Mexican officials confirmed the 24-year-old man had been arrested and that the four Americans were discovered at a wooden house outside Matamoros.. The victims had been transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday, the officials, including Mr Barrios Mojica, said.. Investigators think the Gulf Cartel, one of the oldest organised crime groups in Mexico, is responsible for the attack, a US law enforcement source told CBS. . It is still unclear whether the Americans were ambushed, mistaken for competing drug traffickers, or were caught in cross-fire between warring factions. . US State Department officials said on Tuesday that the investigation is still in the early stages. . Ms McGee was said to be travelling to the Mexican border town to have a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat.. Her mother Barbara Burgess told ABC News that she had asked her daughter not to go, but her daughter had reassured her she would be safe. . The FBI had offered a $50,000 (£42,000) reward for the return of the Americans. . Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US State Department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".. Medical tourism is common, particularly among people living in US border states. . But Matamoros is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, as drug cartels control large swathes of the state of Tamaulipas and can hold more power than local law enforcement.   . ",

        "content": "Their killings, in Hawara further south, led .  in one of the worst such acts in years.. The assault on Hawara drew condemnation from around the world.. The raid on Tuesday afternoon took place in a refugee camp which is a frequent target for Israeli operations against Palestinian militants.. There were reports of heavy exchanges of gunfire, while videos on social media showed smoke billowing from a building and helicopters flying over a long line of military vehicles.  . The Israeli military says it used shoulder-launched missiles as it pursued the wanted man and claims local armed fighters shot at troops from an ambulance.  . The Palestinian health ministry listed the dead as five men in their 20s and one man of 49, identified as Abdel Fattah Kharousha.  . It is understood that he was a member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas from Nablus and had served time in an Israeli jail. Palestinian sources suggest that he carried out the shooting of the brothers on 26 February. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said two of his sons suspected of assisting with the attack on the brothers were arrested in a simultaneous operation in Nablus on Tuesday. . Hillel Yaniv, 22, and Yagel Yaniv, 20, were killed as they drove through Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus. . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video message, saying Israeli forces had \"eliminated the abominable terrorist who murdered [the brothers] in cold blood\".. \"Our brave warriors operated surgically in the heart of the murderers' den.\". A spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said the Israeli government was responsible for \"this dangerous escalation\", accusing it of waging \"all-out war\".. Within hours of the brothers' killings, hundreds of Jewish settlers stormed into Hawara in revenge, setting fire to dozens of cars and homes. Palestinian officials said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash was shot dead by the Israeli army, when soldiers entered their village with settlers, but the Israeli military said it was not involved. More than 100 Palestinians were injured, the Palestinian health ministry said.. The attack on Hawara was one of the most violent incidents of its kind by Jewish settlers, with tensions and violence between settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank a constant issue.. Palestinians accused the Israeli army of doing nothing to try to stop the settlers attacking the town. There was further violence in Hawara on Monday night, with security camera footage showing settlers throwing stones at a Palestinian family in a parked car before it managed to speed away.. There has been a surge of violence between Israel and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem this year.. At least 70 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces, and on the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in attacks, all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer..

        "content": "The storm first wreaked havoc in south-eastern Africa in late February, killing 21 people and displacing thousands in both countries.. Meteorologists say it is rare for a storm to make such a loop.. The tropical cyclone is on track to become the longest-lasting storm on record and it continues to gain strength.. The storm has already broken records for the strength it has accumulated and the 8,000-km (5,000-mile) path it travelled across the Indian Ocean.. Its longevity and strength have drawn the interest of weather experts globally.. The cyclone developed off the north Australian Coast in early February and then travelled thousands of kilometres across the southern Indian Ocean, affecting Mauritius and La Réunion, before making landfalls in Madagascar two weeks later and then Mozambique.. Experts say that is a very rare path for such a storm to take.. It already holds the record for highest accumulated cyclone energy in the southern hemisphere. That is a measure of a storm's strength over time.. Mozambique is now bracing for a second landfall, whilst still reeling from the rains and floods brought by the cyclone.. Madagascar received around three times its usual monthly average rainfall in the past week alone.. The Weather and Climate Extremes evaluation committee of the UN says it will probably set up an investigation into this \"remarkable\" and \"rare occurrence\" after the cyclone has dissipated.. ",

        "content": "According to the lawsuit, doctors are refusing the procedure even in extreme cases out of fear of prosecution.. In a statement, the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton said he would \"enforce the laws\" of the state. . Mr Paxton \"is committed to doing everything in his power to protect mothers, families, and unborn children\", the statement said.. The Center for Reproductive Justice has filed the legal action on behalf of the five women - Ashley Brandt, Lauren Hall, Lauren Miller, Anna Zargarian and Amanda Zurawski - and two healthcare providers that are also plaintiffs. . The pro-choice group said it is the first time pregnant women themselves have taken action against anti-abortion laws passed across the US since the Supreme Court last year removed constitutional protection for abortion rights.. \"It is now dangerous to be pregnant in Texas,\" said Nancy Northup, the centre's president on Tuesday. . With Ms Northup outside the Texas Capitol in Austin on Tuesday, the plaintiffs - two pregnant - shared harrowing stories of their lost pregnancies. . According to the legal action, all were told that their foetuses would not survive, but were not given the option of an abortion, which they described as \"standard medical procedure\" throughout the country and in the state before Texas' ban came into effect.. Ms Zurawski, 35, said she had become pregnant after 18 months of fertility treatments. She had just entered her second trimester when she was told she had dilated prematurely and that the loss of her foetus, whom she and her husband had named Willow, was \"inevitable\".  . \"But even though we would, with complete certainty, lose Willow, my doctor could not intervene while her heart was still beating or until I was sick enough for the ethics board at the hospital to consider my life at risk,\" Ms Zurawski said. . For three days, trapped in a \"bizarre and avoidable hell\", Ms Zurawski was forced to wait until her body entered sepsis - also known as blood poisoning - and doctors were allowed to perform an abortion, according to the lawsuit. . Ms Zurawski spent three days in intensive care, leaving the hospital after a week, the legal action says. The ordeal has made it harder for her to conceive in future, she said. . The four other women had to travel outside Texas for an abortion. . One of the plaintiffs, Ms Miller, said: \"Healthcare should not be determined by some politician with no understanding of medicine or the critical role that abortion care plays in pregnancy. How is it that I can get an abortion for a dog but not for me?\". Two of the women's foetuses had conditions that meant they did not develop a skull, according to the lawsuit.. These cases \"are just tip of the iceberg\", the Center for Reproductive Justice's Ms Northup said.. Their 91-page complaint asks for a ruling that clarifies Texas' law and its stance on \"medical emergencies\" for pregnant people facing grave health risks.  . \"With the threat of losing their medical licences, fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and up to 99 years in prison lingering over their heads, it is no wonder that doctors and hospitals are turning patients away - even patients in medical emergencies,\" the lawsuit reads.. , 61% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, though the opinion poll found public support for the procedure fell as a pregnancy progressed.. Texas' legislature, which is under Republican control, has been at the forefront of anti-abortion legislation, becoming the first state to enact a near-total ban. . And the state will be home to another abortion battle soon: a Texas judge is expected to rule on a case about abortion pills this week. . The Trump-appointed US District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will rule on whether Mifepristone - one of the two drugs used in an abortion pill regime - can continue to be sold in the US. . ",
