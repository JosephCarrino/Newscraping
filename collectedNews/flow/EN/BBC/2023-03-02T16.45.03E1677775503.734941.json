        "content": "Kyiv strongly denied the Russian claim.. The alleged incident has not been independently verified.. Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, .  that it was \"a classic deliberate provocation\". \"RF [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country,\" he said. . Russia has previously reported some Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on Russian border areas, including Bryansk region. But there have been no confirmed reports of Ukrainian ground forces infiltrating Russia.. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"steps to destroy these terrorists are being taken\". Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said FSB forces and regular troops were battling \"Ukrainian nationalists\" who had crossed into Russia.. Speaking on Russian state TV, President Putin said \"today they committed another terrorist act, another crime, penetrated the border area and opened fire on civilians\".. \"They saw that it was a civilian car, that civilians and children were sitting there, and opened fire. It is exactly such people who set themselves the task of depriving us of historical memory. They will achieve nothing, we will put the squeeze on them,\" he said.. A video has appeared online claiming to show members of the Ukraine-based Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) outside a local clinic. One armed man in the video, . , says they crossed into Russia. . The investigative journalism group Bellingcat Monitoring describes the RVC as \"a unit officially formed last year made up primarily of anti-Putin, anti-Kremlin Russian far-right figures active in Ukraine\".. Commenting on the RVC claim, a Ukrainian military intelligence official, Andriy Yusov, said \"these are people who are fighting with arms against the Putin regime and those who support him... Perhaps Russians are beginning to wake up, realise something and take some concrete steps\".. ",

        "content": "\"We won the election and we will prove it to Nigerians,\" he said.. Bola Tinubu of the ruling APC party was declared the winner, with 37% of the vote.. Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition PDP came second with 29%.. Mr Obi said Saturday's elections would go down as \"one of the most controversial elections in Nigeria's history\".. \"The good and hard-working people of Nigeria have again been robbed by our supposed leaders whom they trusted,\" he told journalists on Thursday.. He has 21 days from the day the results were announced to challenge the result at Nigeria's highest appeal court.  . Mr Obi refused to say what evidence he had to prove that he won the election but his challenge is likely to be based on the inability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) to publish results from the polling units in real time using a new electronic transmission system.. Inec officials had promised that results from each of the more than 176,000 polling stations would be scanned and uploaded to its website to aid transparency.. But that was not possible on Saturday, with Inec apologising for what it called \"technical glitches\". It said that any discrepancies between results on the portal and \"physical results\" would be investigated and resolved.. Inec also blamed delays on factors beyond its control, like the lack of internet access at some polling stations, for its inability to upload the results.. But days after the elections ended, the commission has still not uploaded all the results from the polling units to its website.. The elections were marred by lengthy delays which saw some voters queuing through the night to cast their ballots and voting extended to Sunday in some areas.. There were also some cases of arming men attacking polling stations and stealing ballot boxes.. But it is not clear whether such problems were enough to affect the outcome, as Mr Tinubu had a margin of victory of about 1.8 million votes.. Although Mr Obi was with the PDP until last year, and was its vice-presidential candidate in 2019, he was seen by many as a fresh face, and mounted a strong challenge to the two parties which have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999.. He gained particular support among young people, especially in the south, who feel they have been failed by previous generations of political leaders.. ",

        "content": "The two met briefly on the sidelines of the G20 summit in India, Mr Blinken said.. He also raised the case of Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia.. In the brief meeting, Mr Blinken urged Russia to rejoin the New START nuclear arms control treaty, calling its recent withdrawal an \"irresponsible decision\". . A senior State Department official said the discussion in Delhi lasted less than 10 minutes.. The official told reporters that Mr Blinken had \"disabused\" Mr Lavrov of any idea that US support for Ukraine is wavering. . Neither the official nor Mr Blinken commented on how Mr Lavrov responded. The official, however, said that there was no indication that Russia will change course in the near term.. The Russian foreign ministry said Mr Blinken had asked to speak to Mr Lavrov but did not comment on the conversation.. The last time the two met was in Geneva in January 2022. . Both Mr Lavrov and Mr Blinken commented on the war in Ukraine earlier during the Delhi summit. . On Thursday, Mr Lavrov accused Western countries of trying to influence neutral states to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. . \"The West continues its attempts to push everyone and everything,\" he said.. Mr Blinken reportedly held talks with top diplomats during the Delhi summit to rally support for Ukraine. In a closed-door group meeting on Thursday morning, Mr Blinken reemphasised his condemnation of the war.. \"We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability,\" he said, according to a text of his remarks released to reporters by the US State Department. . \"Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine,\" he added.. Mr Blinken repeated his condemnation to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva later in the day, where he appeared via video conference.. At a news conference on Thursday in Delhi, Mr Blinken said Russia should \"engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace\". He added, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has demonstrated zero interest in engaging\".. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. ",
