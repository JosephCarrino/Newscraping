        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large MQ-9 Reaper drone . The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.. Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.. \"I don't know whether we'll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done. And we will certainly work on it,\" Mr Patrushev said.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US also wanted to locate the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. Speaking to ABC America's morning news program, Good Morning America, he added that there were logistical challenges as it crashed in \"very deep water\".. US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", the US said in a statement on Tuesday. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . Ukraine's foreign minister told the BBC incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Dmytro Kuleba said: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place. . \"So the only way to prevent such incidents is actually to kick Russia out of Crimea.\". Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. He told the Ukraine contact group: \"It is incumbent upon Russia to operate its aircraft in a safe and professional manner.\". After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",

        "content": "Dr Jiang was praised for saving lives after writing a letter in the early stage of the Sars crisis which revealed officials were playing down the threat.. But he endured house arrest at one point for his unwavering outspokenness. . Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide in 2003. Of these, 774 died, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. . Dr Jiang had been working in a Beijing hospital in April 2003, when he was alarmed to hear the Chinese health minister telling the public there were only a handful of cases of a new deadly respiratory disease.. The senior doctor said he knew more than 100 people had Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - in military hospital wards alone.. He sent a letter exposing the lies in the official narrative to Chinese state broadcasters, who ignored it. But the letter was then leaked to foreign media which published his account in full.. His revelations forced the Chinese government to admit it had provided false information, and spurred the WHO into action.. Strict containment measures were imposed overnight, which helped slow the spread of the virus. . His actions also led to the sacking of China's health minister and Beijing's mayor at the time.. \"I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world,\" he said about his actions.. The following year, Dr Jiang again challenged Beijing. He called on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to acknowledge its 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters had been wrong - and that hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians had been killed.. He wrote of his experience working as a surgeon in Beijing on that night. .  how authorities \"acted in frenzied fashion, using tanks, machine guns and other weapons to suppress the totally unarmed students and citizens\".. Ordinary Chinese would be \"increasingly disappointed and angry\" with the CCP's view of the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, he said. \"Our party must address the mistake it has made,\" he wrote.. He and his wife, Hua Zhongwei, were later detained, but Dr Jiang remained for years undeterred on the topic. He wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019, denouncing the Tiananmen Square crackdown as a \"crime\". . Dr Jiang was born in 1931 in the eastern city of Hangzhou to a wealthy banking family and went into medicine after seeing his aunt die of tuberculosis. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, according to South China Morning Post.. Over his lifetime he received several civil honours recognising his public stands, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 2004.. \"He broke China's habit of silence and forced the truth of Sars into the open,\" the award citation read.. Dr Jiang's experience has drawn comparisons with China's initial approach to the Covid-19 outbreak. . Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, was .  after trying to warn people of a \"Sars-like virus\" in December 2019. . After falling sick from Covid himself, Dr Li said on Chinese social media that he wondered why authorities were saying no medical staff had been infected. Dr Li died of the virus in February 2020. .

        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Later on Wednesday, the Lahore High Court ordered police to postpone the arrest of Mr Khan until Thursday, pending the result of a hearing on the legitimacy of the arrest warrant.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. On Wednesday, the streets outside Mr Khan's home were littered with debris and smouldering barricades.. His supporters gathered at one of the roads - a major highway in Lahore - and chanted his name.. Hours earlier, officers in riot gear had fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to disperse hundreds of supporters at the compound. Some in the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. \"I have never witnessed such brutality, that's what shocks me,\" Waqar Khan, a PTI supporter told the BBC.. Recalling Tuesday's clashes, one woman, Tazeen, said: \"Are we not humans? What kind of a country is this? People around me could not breathe,\" one woman, Tazeen, said.. Mr Khan has said he did not appear in court because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . He earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. ",

The UAE denied that conditions were poor and said it was working with the US to finish the resettlement process.. More than 10,000 other Afghans who were flown to the UAE have reportedly been resettled in the US, Canada and elsewhere, while a further 70,000 were evacuated directly to the US before American troops left Kabul.. The Afghans flown to Abu Dhabi following the Taliban takeover were housed in two converted apartment complexes known as Emirates Humanitarian City and Tasameem Workers City.. , including eight who had previously worked at some point for US government-affiliated entities or programmes in Afghanistan. . They reported constraints on their freedom of movement, lack of access to fair and effective refugee status determination, lack of adequate access to legal counsel, inadequate education for children, and no psychosocial support.. The detainees also described overcrowding, decaying infrastructure and insect infestations, according to the US-based campaign group.. One unnamed Afghan was quoted as saying that Emirates Humanitarian City was \"exactly like a prison\", while another described a \"widespread mental health crisis among residents\".. Under international law and UN Refugee Agency guidance, asylum seekers and migrants should not be detained for administrative purposes unless it is necessary and proportional to achieve a legitimate aim, and only in the absence of viable alternatives.. HRW called on the UAE to release the detainees and provide access to fair and efficient processes for determining their status and protection needs.. \"Governments should not ignore the shocking plight of these Afghans stranded in limbo in the UAE,\" said Joey Shea, the group's UAE researcher. . \"The US government in particular, which co-ordinated the 2021 evacuations and with whom many evacuees worked before the Taliban takeover, should immediately step up and intervene to provide support and protection for these asylum seekers.\". An Emirati official told AFP news agency that the UAE was providing \"high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counselling, education and food services\" for the Afghans at Emirates Humanitarian City.. They also said the UAE was continuing to work with US authorities to \"resettle the remaining evacuees in a timely manner\".. \"We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete,\" they added.. The US state department said there was an \"enduring\" US commitment to resettle all eligible Afghans, including those at Emirates Humanitarian City.. ",

        "content": "The city's Board of Supervisors has begun considering the recommendations.. Supporters say it would be just compensation to black Americans for the legacy of slavery and racism. . Opponents say the price tag is too high. . The San Francisco board enthusiastically welcomed the proposals at Tuesday's first hearing, according to the Associated Press news agency. . The committee's draft proposal, first released in December, outlines more than 100 suggestions.. It is widely viewed as the most detailed policy effort yet in the US on the controversial issue of reparations.. Supporters of the plan say it is needed to redress the legacy of US slavery and racist policies, which they argue have disproportionately harmed black Americans in terms of poverty, poor health, incarceration and economic status.. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the reparations committee chairman Eric McDonnell said: \"When you consider all of the ways in which the systems and practices have been managed to exclude and steal, if you will, the opportunities for financial mobility - families are hurting and have been for decades, if not longer. . \"Financial repair is time sensitive. That is not one that can or should wait.\". But critics - who include political liberals in the city - have labelled it a financial and political nightmare. . They argue that Californians who were never slave owners should not have to give money to people who were not enslaved.. Some have also argued it would be difficult to fund such a proposition amid a tech industry downturn in Silicon Valley, for which San Francisco is the main hub. . A proper analysis of the cost of the proposals has yet to be completed by the committee. . The panel's final report is expected to be released in June. Then it will be up to lawmakers in the state legislature to draft any actual measure and decide whether to vote to pass it.. The reparations debate has gained momentum in the US in recent years, particularly after the nationwide racial justice movement of 2020. That year, California became the first state to form a reparations task force. . Since then Boston City Council has also approved a reparations task force. . In 2021, Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, approved reparations for some residents, including money for home repairs, down payments and interest or late penalties due on property. . One of the difficulties being discussed in San Francisco is how to determine who qualifies. . About 50,000 black people live in San Francisco, but it's not clear how many would be eligible.. Qualifying criteria under the plan include that a person would need to be at least 18 years old and have identified as black or African American in public documents for at least a decade. .
