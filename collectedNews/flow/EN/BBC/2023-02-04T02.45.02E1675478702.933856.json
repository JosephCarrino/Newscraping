        "content": "The proposed $72bn (Â£60bn) buyout never materialised.. If the San Francisco jury had found Mr Musk liable he could have been ordered to pay billions of dollars in damages.. It took the nine jurors less than two hours to reach their verdict on Friday afternoon. . Mr Musk - who had wanted the trial moved to Texas, where Tesla is based, arguing he could not get a fair trial in San Francisco - welcomed the outcome.. Taking to Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44bn last October, he posted: \"Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!. \"I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.\". Central to the lawsuit was Mr Musk's tweet on 7 August 2018: \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\". The plaintiffs also argued Mr Musk had lied when he tweeted later in the day that \"investor support is confirmed\".. The stock price surged after the tweets, but fell back again within days as it became clear the deal would not go through.. Investor losses were calculated as high as $12bn, according to an economist hired by the shareholders.. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mr Musk over his tweets, accusing him of lying to investors. Mr Musk agreed to step aside as Tesla board chairman and settled for $20m.. During the three-week trial, Mr Musk - who also leads SpaceX and Twitter - had argued he thought he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund for the deal.. During his nearly nine hours on the witness stand, the world's second-richest man said: \"Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.\". Shareholders had argued that \"funding secured\" suggested more than a verbal agreement. . Although Tesla's share price shot up after the tweet was posted, Mr Musk also questioned whether his tweets had any effect on Tesla's share price. . \"At one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high... and it went higher, which is counterintuitive,\" he said - arguing the effect his tweets have on the stock price can be unpredictable. . Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan to take Tesla private after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded.. He was not in court when the verdict was read, but he was present during closing arguments earlier on Friday as duelling portraits were drawn of him by the rival legal teams.. Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders, said: \"Our society is based on rules. We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else.\". Mr Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said: \"Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud.\". After the verdict, Mr Porritt said: \"We are disappointed with the verdict and are considering next steps.\". Mr Musk was generally calm during his testimony - though at times he appeared annoyed at the line of questioning. . There were also times of levity. After a lawyer representing shareholders accidentally called Elon Musk \"Mr Tweet\", Elon Musk promptly changed his name on Twitter to the same moniker. . Several Tesla directors also testified, including James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. They testified that Mr Musk did not need the Tesla board to review buyout tweets. . Securities fraud lawyer Reed Kathrein called the tweet about taking Tesla private \"as concrete a statement of taking a company private as there can be\", and said the not guilty verdict was \"a travesty to investors and the securities laws\".  .

        "content": "Mr Panahi, 62, was arrested last July when he protested against the detention of two fellow filmmakers, who had been critical of the authorities.. His wife told the BBC he was told he had an outstanding jail term to serve.. Tahereh Saeedi said at the time that his detention - several months before the ongoing anti-government protests erupted - amounted to a kidnapping.. Mr Panahi has won many awards at international film festivals. They include the Berlin International Film Festival's top prize, the Golden Bear, for Taxi in 2015, as well as the Best Screenplay prize at the Cannes Film Festival, for Three Faces in 2018.. The Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux expressed \"great relief\" over the film maker's release.. \"We do not forget all those, in Iran and around the world, who are subjected to violence and repression,\" Mr Fremaux told the AFP news agency. \"The Cannes Film Festival will always remain alongside artists from all over the world in defence of freedom.\".  concerning the collapse of a 10-storey building in the city of Abadan last May that killed more than 40 people. They were accused of \"inciting unrest and disrupting the psychological security of society\", Iran's state media reported.. In a separate development, photos have emerged on social media purportedly showing an emaciated jailed Iranian dissident, Farhad Meysami.. Mr Meysami, 53, is now on hunger strike, his lawyer says. . Some reports suggest he has been refusing food for weeks.. In a letter, a copy of which has been seen by BBC Persian, Mr Meysami repeated his previous demands: an end to executions of protesters and to the government's headscarf policy for women, and the release of political prisoners.. Amnesty International said the photos \"are a shocking reminder of the Iranian authorities' contempt for human rights\".. Iran's judiciary denied the hunger strike claim and said the photos were from four years ago when Mr Meysami, a physician, did go on hunger strike, Reuters reports.. Mr Meysami has been in jail since 2018 for publicly supporting women activists.. ",

        "content": "The package includes ground-launched small-diameter bombs (GLSDB) which can hit targets 150km (93 miles) away.. But officials refused to be drawn on speculation that the munitions could be used to attack parts of annexed Crimea. . \"When it comes to Ukrainian plans on operations, clearly that is their decision,\" Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters. . \"This gives them a longer-range capability, long-range fires capability, that will enable them, again, to conduct operations in defence of their country and take back their sovereign territory, Russian-occupied areas.\". Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and considers it part of its territory. But it has come under sporadic fire from Ukrainian forces in recent months. . Western nations have repeatedly ruled out providing Ukraine with offensive weapons - such as fighter jets - which it could use to strike against Russia itself. . In a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US and President Joe Biden for the additional aid. . \"The more long-range our weapons are and the more mobile our troops are, the sooner Russia's brutal aggression will end,\" Mr Zelensky wrote. \"Together with [the US] we stand against terror.\" . Previously, Ukraine's longest range weapon was the Himars rocket system, which can hit targets at a range of up to 80km (50 miles). Kyiv used the system to devastating effect during its counter-offensive in the south and east last year. . The GLSDB also gives Ukraine forces an ability to strike anywhere in the Russian-occupied Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. It also allows Ukraine to threaten Russian supply lines in the east. . Manufactured by Boeing and Saab, GLSDB is a gliding rocket with a small bomb attached, capable of striking a target within one metre of its position. . And it can be fired from a variety of weapons systems, including the Himars and M270 MLRS systems already in use in Ukraine. However, both the Pentagon and Boeing refused to comment on delivery dates for the system, with some reports suggesting that it could take up to nine months before it reaches Ukraine. . The new package - which will also include additional Himars missiles and 250 Javelin anti-armour systems - comes amid mounting concerns that Western nations have been too slow to provide fresh military aid to Ukraine. . \"GLSDB should have been approved last fall, US House of Representatives Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers said in a tweet. \"Every day it's not approved is a day it's delayed getting it into the hands of a Ukrainian ready to kill a Russian.\". In recent days, reports have emerged that a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region has been gaining momentum, with pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that the town of Bakhmut, long a focal point of Russian attacks, has been surrounded from three-sides. . But President Zelensky said his forces were entrenched around the town and would not surrender it to Russian assaults. . \"We consider Backhmut to be our fortress,\" the Ukrainian leader said. \"If weapon [deliveries] are accelerated - namely long-range weapons - we will not only not withdraw from Bakhmut, we will begin to de-occupy Donbas, which has been occupied since 2014.\". Mr Zelensky said earlier that a long-rumoured Russian spring offensive in the region had already begun and his Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said earlier this week that .  for the renewed assault. . Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leader has been holding new EU accession talks with the bloc's leaders, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, in Kyiv. . Speaking after the summit, Mr Zelensky said the leaders had reached an \"understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year\". . But Ms von der Leyen said there were \"no rigid timelines\" in place and emphasised that Ukraine had political goals it must meet before joining the block. . The EU has repeatedly underlined the need for Ukraine to step up its fight against endemic corruption, reform its judiciary by weeding out political interference and strengthen its economy.. Elsewhere, Germany has announced plans to send Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine. The earlier model of the Leopard 2s - which Berlin has already promised to provide - can be delivered to Kyiv sooner than the advanced model. . ",

        "content": "Noah David Beard, 25, was taken into custody without incident. Their alleged motive remains unclear.. The six victims were gunned down on 16 January in the rural town of Goshen.. Both suspects were detained early on Friday and face six counts of murder and other crimes.. \"I'm happy we were able to put these two men behind bars,\" said Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux, adding that Mr Uriarte was expected to survive an exchange of fire with federal agents.. He added that the suspects and members of the victims' families were known to have a long history of gang violence. . Four generations of one family - ranging in age from 10 months to 72 - were killed in the attack in the San Joaquin Valley. . Authorities had offered a $10,000 (Â£8,297) reward for information leading to the suspects' arrests. . Mr Boudreaux said the manhunt was known as \"Operation Nightmare\", and it involved around-the-clock surveillance of the suspects and multiple search warrants, some of which included inmates' cells in state prisons. . The county sheriff said one of the victims, teenage mother Elyssa Parraz, 16, had just days earlier been reunited with her 10-month-old baby, Nycholas Parraz, who had been living in foster care. . The baby's grandmother and great-grandmother were also among the victims, police and family say.. At a news conference in January, Mr Boudreaux said the child and mother appeared to have been fleeing the scene, and that forensic evidence showed the killer had stood over the victims and fired at their heads from above.. A few survivors remained at the \"horrific\" scene when officers arrived, he said.. ",
