        "content": "Watch: US releases footage of drone crash with Russian jet. The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Ukraine on Tuesday.. Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.. It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.. The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\" . He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. . Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as .  - and the edited video released appears to back that up. . A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian SU-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.  . In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.. When the picture returns a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. . Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. . The US insists the drone was being operated in international air space.  . In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary .  the remnants of the drone.. On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.. ",

        "content": "Findings suggest new hubs for trafficking have emerged in West and Central Africa. . The report also said traffickers were using international postal services more often to get drugs to consumers.. \"Globally, the use of parcel and courier services increased significantly during the Covid-related lockdown due to restrictions on passenger flights,\" the .  report said.. It noted a rise in West African countries in the use of \"well established, globally operating postal services as well as smaller shopping companies\" used to smuggle quantities of cocaine to Europe and beyond.. Overall, the the report found Europe and North America are the largest markets for cocaine, followed by South and Central America and the Caribbean.. While the report said the markets in Africa and Asia were \"still limited\", the UN's Ghada Waly said the potential for the market to expand there was a dangerous reality.. Production increase was the result of an expansion in the cultivation of coca bush, as well as improvements in converting coca into powdered cocaine, the report found.. It added the outbreak of Covid-19 had a \"disruptive\" effect on drug markets as international travel was severely curtailed.. Demand for cocaine slumped as nightclubs and bars were shut during the pandemic lockdowns.. \"However, the most recent data suggests this slump has had little impact on longer-term trends,\" the report says. \"The global supply of cocaine is at record levels.\". In the UK, the report says there has been a \"significant increase\" in seizures of cocaine in the \"fast parcel and postal modes\".. Interceptions by law enforcement have also been on the rise - at a higher speed than production, the report outlines.. Other key findings include: . Reacting to the report, UN's chief of research and trend Angela Me said the supply of cocaine has risen in South America as criminal groups have taken control of areas previously run by Colombia's largest rebel group - . She said this has led to competition among groups - including some foreign groups - which has increased the production.. This video can not be played.

Mr Kaminski said the cell had been preparing \"sabotage actions\" in Poland.. \"Evidence indicates that this group monitored railway lines. Their tasks included recognising, monitoring and documenting weapons' transports to Ukraine,\" Mr Kaminski told a news briefing on Thursday morning. . \"The suspects were also preparing sabotage actions aimed at paralysing the supply of equipment, weapons and aid to Ukraine.\". Six of the suspects have been charged with conducting espionage for Russia and participation in an organised criminal group, after they were detained as part of an operation conducted by Poland's Internal Security Agency (ABW). .
