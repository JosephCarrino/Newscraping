US officials say they linked the breach to a group called \"Lazarus\", believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau.. \"Through our investigations we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with [North Korea], are responsible for the theft,\" the FBI said in a statement on Thursday. . Lazarus Group gained notoriety in 2014 after they were accused of hacking into Sony Pictures and publicly leaking confidential data. . The group demanded that Sony withdraw its then-upcoming film The Interview, a satirical comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. . A United Nations panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as a way to avoid international sanctions.. \"The United States is aware that the DPRK has increasingly relied on illicit activities - including cybercrime - to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs as it tries to evade robust US and UN sanctions,\" Reuters quoted a Treasury Department spokesperson as saying..

        "content": "Three Israeli police were hurt, they said.. The flashpoint site is deeply important to Muslims and Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount, and is at the heart of competing historical claims.. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have soared recently after deadly attacks in Israel and Palestinian deaths during subsequent Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank.. A 17-year-old Palestinian wounded on Thursday during an Israeli operation in the area of Jenin in the northern West Bank died on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said. . More than 20 Palestinians, many identified as gunmen, have been killed since Israel stepped up sweeps in the West Bank, centring on Jenin district, after a Palestinian killed three Israelis in Tel Aviv last Thursday. . That attack was the fourth in Israel by Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in just over two weeks. The killings have left 12 Israelis and two Ukrainians dead, marking the deadliest period of attacks in Israel for more than 15 years and leaving the country on edge.. Israeli police said dozens of Palestinians, some carrying flags of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, marched on the compound at about 04:00 (01:00 GMT) then started throwing stones and fireworks. . The police said they waited until Muslim Friday prayers had ended before entering the site to disperse the rioters, who had started throwing stones towards the Western Wall below the compound, where Jewish worshippers were.. The police tweeted video showing fireworks exploding inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and masked youths throwing stones towards officers. . Israel's foreign ministry tweeted video showing masked Palestinians inside the Qibli mosque (also known as al-Aqsa Mosque) throwing objects with the sound of a bang followed by a spray of sparks.. The foreign ministry denied reports on social media that police had entered the mosque building itself during the violence. Hours later footage from inside the mosque building showed Israeli police and Palestinians there with the scene more calm.. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned Israel's actions at the compound, saying it held it \"fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences\". . The clashes come after militant groups in Gaza called for \"hundreds of thousands\" of Palestinians to converge on the compound on Friday \"to protect our nation and our mosque\". . Last year Hamas, which governs Gaza, fired rockets towards Jerusalem following clashes at the mosque compound after weeks of unrest in the city, triggering a devastating 11-day war with Israel.. The compound is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and is also considered, in its entirety, as al-Aqsa Mosque. It is the third holiest site in Islam. . The same ground is sacred to Jews as the location of two biblical temples, and is the holiest site in Judaism. The question of rights there is one of the most contentious issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and between Israel and the wider Muslim world.. The recent surge in violence comes at a particularly volatile time, with the start of the Jewish festival of Passover on Friday night coinciding with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Christian festival of Easter.. Passover traditionally sees an increase in visits by religious Jews to the site, which are viewed by Palestinians as provocative.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Mr Depp has sued his ex-wife over a story she wrote in which she described herself as a victim of domestic violence. He denies any abuse. . Ms Heard filed a $100m counterclaim.. In testimony recorded in February and played for jurors on Thursday, Ms Anderson said she had seen the famous couple for several therapy sessions between October and December 2015. Ms Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 after just 15 months of marriage. . The psychotherapist described a volatile dynamic between Mr Depp and Ms Heard, with both threatening to walk out of sessions amid arguments. . In sessions without Mr Depp present, Ms Anderson said, Ms Heard reported physical assault at the hands of her then-husband. On one occasion Ms Heard came to her office with several small bruises on her face, she testified. . On more than one occasion Ms Heard initiated violent interactions in an effort to prevent Mr Depp from leaving, Ms Anderson said.. \"It was a point of pride to her, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,\" Ms Anderson told jurors. \"If he was going to leave her to de-escalate from the fight, she would strike him to keep him there, she would rather be in a fight than have him leave.\". Ms Anderson said that Mr Depp was often interrupted by Ms Heard during the therapy sessions.. \"Ms Heard had a jackhammer style of talking,\" the clinical psychologist said. \"She was very amped up. He had trouble talking at a similar pace. He was cut off a lot.\". Ms Anderson testified to both Ms Heard and Mr Depp's family history of domestic violence. Ms Heard was beaten by her father, she said, and Mr Depp was beaten by his mother. . Mr Depp had been \"well controlled\" for decades before meeting Ms Heard, Ms Anderson said, and did not engage in violence with past partners. \"With Ms Heard, he was triggered. They engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse.\" . At issue in the trial is Ms Heard's 2018 opinion piece in the Washington Post, describing herself as a \"public figure representing domestic abuse\". Mr Depp says the article - which does not mention him by name - is defamatory and derailed his career.. Jurors have so far been presented with duelling accounts of Depp and Heard's relationship. . Ms Heard's team has portrayed Mr Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. . Mr Depp's team has presented Ms Heard's claims of domestic violence as a \"hoax\" and a calculated strategy to ruin his reputation.  . Also on Thursday, a former personal assistant to Ms Heard, Kate James, testified about what allegedly happened when she asked her then-boss for a salary increase. . Ms James said: \"She [Ms Heard] leapt up out of her chair, put her face approximately four inches from my face. She was spitting in my face, telling me how dare you ask me for the salary you're asking for.\". The trial, expected to last at least six weeks, is being broadcast live and will involve a number of high-profile witnesses, including James Franco, Paul Bettany and Elon Musk..

        "content": "El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, was linked to the abduction, torture and beheading of several IS hostages in Syria, including journalists and aid workers.. On Thursday, after an 11-day trial, he was found guilty of lethal hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder.. Elsheikh was the highest profile IS fighter to stand trial in the US.. Hostages nicknamed the Sudanese-born Londoner and two other men the Beatles - after the rock band - because of their UK accents.. The group's actions are said to have resulted in the deaths of four American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig.. They are also blamed in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto.. Some of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The killings triggered outrage around the world.. Elsheikh was the only one of the three militants to go on trial in the US, after Alexanda Kotey pleaded guilty to his own charges last September and Mohammed Emwazi was killed in a 2015 drone strike in Syria. Aine Davis, an alleged fourth member, is currently imprisoned in Turkey.. Four rows in the courtroom were permanently reserved for former hostages and their family members.. It was tense inside the courtroom when everybody got news of a verdict. The jury had been deliberating for five-and-a-half hours. David Haines' daughter Bethany was shaking as she sat down.. When the guilty verdict came through, the families quietly sobbed, as did the former hostages. They held each other's hands.. Diane Foley closed her eyes and sighed with relief. Steven Sotloff's father Art smiled and said: \"This is good.\" For them, it's been a long road to justice.. Elsheikh showed little emotion - which he has always done in the trial - as his fate was sealed.. Over the course of the trial, several of them took the stand for the government, depicting the Beatles as a cohesive unit that revelled in brutality.. Witnesses recounted receiving random beatings, being given dog names and being forced to sing a parody of the Eagles' pop song \"Hotel California\" retitled \"Hotel Osama\".. Families also detailed their painstaking negotiations with the group, with Marsha Mueller telling the court how she and her husband had \"begged\" for their daughter Kayla's life in emails.. Lawyers for Elsheikh, meanwhile, claimed that he \"a simple Isis fighter\" who went to Syria alone on behalf of \"suffering Muslims\".. Outside the courtroom, Diane Foley - whose son James was executed on camera, with the video widely distributed by IS - told the BBC she was feeling \"relief and a tremendous sense of gratitude that mercy and justice has prevailed\".. \"This is a big day for accountability,\" she said. \"We will never stop hostage taking without accountability.\". Mike Haines, whose brother David also died in the group's captivity, said Thursday's result marked the end of \"an eight-year chapter of pain\" for his family.. \"This unanimous judgement is a triumph for society over ills like terrorism and helps differentiate us from the hateful, divisive ideologies that fuel these individuals,\" he said.. \"It must also act as a warning to anyone else seduced by the false glamour of extremism.\". Elsheikh's extradition to Virginia was part of a complex negotiation between the US and UK.. As part of the agreement, he will not face the death penalty - but his conviction on all eight charges means he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.. He will be sentenced in August but must also appear in court on 29 April for victim impact statements read during Kotey's sentencing.. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.

        "content": "That scheme will initially focus on single men crossing the Channel in boats or lorries from France.. The prime minister said it would \"save countless lives\" and break the business model of traffickers, but campaigners have called the plan \"inhumane\".. Two more migrant crossings were recorded on Friday morning despite thick fog, the BBC's Simon Jones said.  . Andrew Griffith MP - director of the No 10 policy unit - said the new scheme would not require new legislation and could be implemented under \"existing conventions\".. He told BBC Newsnight it could therefore be launched \"in weeks or a small number of months\".. He added that, if the flow of illegal migration could be stopped, it would leave \"lots of capacity for the very generous safe and legal routes\" into the UK.. The Rwanda scheme is part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats.. The Royal Navy has taken operational command of the Channel from UK Border Force in an effort to detect every boat headed to the UK.. Some 562 people on 14 boats made the journey on the day the new scheme was announced, according to the Ministry of Defence. No one making the crossing is believed to have arrived on UK soil \"on their own terms\", it added.. Last year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,404 in 2020.. Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force, said it could be weeks before it became clear if the \"radical\" new scheme was feasible.. He told BBC Breakfast the government was likely to face a legal challenge when people are put on aircraft bound for Rwanda.. \"But then I'm not sure what the answer is to stopping the boats… because if we don't do something, then more people are going to drown,\" he said, adding the UK was potentially facing its biggest asylum intake ever.. In a speech on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the agreement with Rwanda would provide \"safe and legal routes for asylum\".. \"Economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the UK, while those with genuine need will be properly protected,\" he said.. He said the scheme would cover anyone who had arrived in the UK illegally since the start of this year.. No one we initially spoke to yesterday seemed to know about the Rwanda announcement - but it wasn't long before word spread.. Soon a group of men was asking us lots of questions: \"When will this happen? Why? If I come from Afghanistan will it still apply to me?\". Shafi, who told me he fled Afghanistan, said: \"[Rwanda] is a lot worse place than Afghanistan, there is no future for us in Rwanda.\". But I didn't meet anyone who said the government's plans would prevent them from trying to cross the Channel, including Shafi, who said he had no choice.. Many of these men have already faced huge risks to get this far and are willing to risk their lives crossing the Channel on a small boat.. The risk of being sent to Rwanda, at this stage, seemed like just another thing to factor in down the line.. More than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged the government to scrap the plan, describing it in an open letter as \"shamefully cruel\".. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said it would do little to deter desperate people and \"only lead to more human suffering\".. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract the country from the Partygate scandal with an \"unworkable, unethical, and extortionate\" scheme. . The Lib Dems said the government was \"slamming the door\" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford called the plan \"absolutely chilling\".. Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was \"not much more than a short-term solution\".. Questions are also being raised about the price of the scheme, with .  reporting a cost of £20,000 to £30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda.. But justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove declined to give such a figure, telling BBC Breakfast it would depend on several factors.. He said the UK was spending nearly £5m a day on hotels, while the new scheme would initially cost £120m, with more money to be given later.. A similar programme in Australia cost an estimated £460m in 2021 but successfully resettled only 239 people - a cost of around £1.9m per person. . Concerns are being raised about the human rights record of Rwanda and its president, Paul Kagame.. Mr Pursglove said Rwanda was a progressive country which wanted to provide sanctuary and had made \"huge strides forward\" in the last three decades.. The minister said it was now one of only two countries in the world with a female-majority parliament and had an antidiscrimination law running \"right through its constitution\".. However, just last year the UK government expressed concern at the United Nations about Rwanda's \"continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom\".. Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International UK, said sending people to the east-African nation was \"the very height of irresponsibility\".. Yolande Makolo, a spokesperson for Rwanda's government, told the BBC it is a \"safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights\".. According to an agreement between the two governments, people sent to Rwanda will get accommodation and support. They will be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times..

According to prosecutors, he published a variety of videos online making statements about the New York City subway system, occasionally addressing New York City Mayor Eric Adams as he complained about the \"homeless situation\" on subway cars. . In one video, prosecutors said, the accused said: \"And so the message to me is: I should have just gotten a gun, and started shooting.\" . NYPD acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that the cameras were not working at three stations during the attack because of what the department described as a technical issue.. But it said claims that the lack of station footage had delayed the manhunt were \"unfair and misleading\"..

But with more than 20,000 new cases a day, authorities are struggling to find enough space..

But for some it was just too much, their homes sequestered, their desperation easy for all to hear.. A few miles away, there was an organised protest, a bold stand as the lockdown takes hold in a country where you can be arrested for picking quarrels.. They're angry about a local school being turned into another quarantine facility. Police with riot shields forced them off the streets in the end.. This was on a small scale but it's a sign of anger and frustration as this lockdown goes on..

Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew.. The ship's sinking was described by the US as a \"big blow\", but American officials were unable to confirm whether Ukrainian Neptune missiles were responsible.. \"It's certainly plausible and possible that [Ukraine] did in fact hit this with a Neptune missile or maybe more,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said to CNN. . A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva.. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - . . . Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days.. This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his \"special military operation\" in Ukraine is going according to plan. . Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. . Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. . Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war.. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. . While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. . \"It's more about psychological damage than material damage,\" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC.. \"It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,\" he said. \"But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively.\". But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that \"Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure.\". The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. . The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this.. \"The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. . \"While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover.\". The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection.. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion. . Admiral Lord West, former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said that as well as being a military blow the vessel's loss was \"very embarrassing\".. \"This has a huge impact,\" Lord West said, speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM before confirmation that the Moskva had sunk. . \"Putin loves the navy. When he came into power, the first bit of the old Soviet forces that he put effort into was the navy. He's always had a soft spot for it.\". This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.

        "content": "Ukraine claims it struck the vessel with its Neptune missiles.. The 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target.. Earlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - . . . Prior to the sinking, Russia's defence ministry issued a statement saying \"the vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated\". . On Thursday afternoon, it said a fire onboard had been contained and that it would be towing the warship back to port.. But a statement issued later on Thursday said that, while being towed, the ship \"lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull\".. \"Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,\" it said. . Moscow again blamed the blast on an unexplained fire, making no mention of any missile strike.. But Ukraine says it is responsible for an attack on the cruiser, which it claims it targeted with recently-introduced Ukrainian-made missiles..  before the ship sank, Ukrainian officials said Russian rescue efforts were being hampered by ammunition exploding on board and bad weather.. The BBC has not been able to verify either claim.  . Originally built in Ukraine in the Soviet-era, the vessel entered service in the early 1980s according to Russian media.. The missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection.. It carried over a dozen Vulkan anti-ship missiles and an array of anti-submarine and mine-torpedo weapons, the reports said.. The Moskva is the second major .  since the invasion began.. The Slava-class cruiser was the third largest vessel in Russia's active fleet and one of its most heavily defended assets, naval expert Jonathan Bentham from the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC.. The cruiser was equipped with a triple-tiered air defence system that if operating properly should have given it three opportunities to defend itself from a Neptune missile attack.. In addition to medium- and short-range defences, it could engage six short-range close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last resort. . Mr Bentham said Moskva should have had 360-degree anti-air defence coverage.. \"The CIWS system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser, its last line of defence,\" he said.. If the strike is proven to have come from a missile it \"raises questions over the capabilities of the modernisation of the Russian surface fleet: whether it had enough ammunition, whether it had engineering issues\".. \"Essentially, you'd have thought that with that three-tiered anti-air defence system it would be very hard to hit,\" the military expert added.. Kyiv military officials say they struck the Moskva with a Ukrainian-made Neptune missile.. The cruise missile system was designed by Ukrainian military engineers in response to the growing naval threat posed by Russia in the Black Sea, following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.. , the Ukrainian navy only received its first delivery of the 300km-range (186 miles) Neptune missiles in March last year.. Since the invasion began Ukraine has received an influx of military aid from Western allies, including . . . The warship was a \"symbol of Russian naval power in the Black Sea,\" Michael Petersen of the Russia Maritime Studies Institute told the BBC.. \"The Moskva had been a thorn in the side of the Ukrainians since the beginning of this conflict,\" he said, adding that to see it destroyed would be \"a real morale boost to the Ukrainians.\". The Russian military has been dominant in the Black Sea since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and has used its presence there to launch and supply the invasion.. Its Black Sea fleet has supported the war with the capacity to launch cruise missiles anywhere in Ukraine, and has been important in supporting Russian attempts to seize Mariupol.. In the early days of Russia's invasion the Moskva made global headlines after it ordered a group of Ukrainian soldiers on an outpost in the Black Sea to surrender.. When the troops defiantly refused in a radio message, it was initially believed that the border troops had been killed but in fact they had been taken captive.. The soldiers were later released as part of a prisoner swap with Russia in late March and their commander was honoured with a medal by the Ukrainian military.. The tale of their bravery became such a boost to Ukraine's morale that that the country's postal service commemorated their encounter on Snake Island with a special illustrated stamp..

But they had to sleep on the floor, and Olena says they struggled to find work there because they don't speak the language.. Now, they're heading back east - despite the threat of a renewed Russian assault. Donetsk remains a key target for Russian forces.. Olena's husband is an ambulance driver and still in Slovyansk, waiting for them. When we ask how they feel to cross back into their home country, Olena breaks into a huge grin.. \"Super!\" she says. \"No matter what, we're very happy to be back in Ukraine.\". Since Russia's invasion, more than 10 million people are thought to have left their homes in Ukraine, and . . . But as the front lines stabilise and the country learns to function in a state of war, some Ukrainians are beginning to make the journey back home, even to parts of the country directly threatened by Russian forces. . The war is now well into its second month. Ukraine has held off the Russian assault and fears of a rapid collapse - as President Volodymyr Zelensky told his people this week, it is more than 48 days since military analysts in the West predicted the capital Kyiv had just 48 hours until its fall to the invaders. . People the BBC spoke to at the Polish border said they had tired of life as refugees abroad. Others were desperate to get back for practical reasons - to collect important documents left behind in the confusion after the invasion, protect their homes from looters, or even to pick up children who stayed behind with their fathers. . And for others, the pull of home, friends and family is just too strong.. Sofia is eating a hot dog from one of the fast-food stalls at the border crossing. She's defying her mum's orders, choosing to come back home after just three weeks in the safety of Poland. War is war, but Easter is Easter - she's eager to see her loved ones back home in Lviv this weekend. . The 20-year-old first crossed the frontier into the EU late in March to stay with a godmother's friend in Poznan, after . .. \"Mum forced me, she was panicking,\" Sofia says. But she never felt settled abroad, despite the help for refugees that humanitarian groups and the Polish government have organised. . \"You feel foreign,\" she says. \"Everyone's helping you, but it doesn't feel like home.\" She hopes to stay in the relative calm of Lviv. . Official figures suggest more people are making the same choice. Polish border authorities say numbers going to and from Ukraine are now drawing closer - on Wednesday, 24,700 people entered Poland from Ukraine, while 20,000 people made the opposite trip. It's a sharp reversal from the record 142,000 people who crossed into Poland on 6 March. . Lviv-Holovnyi rail station is a key transit hub in western Ukraine. Trains bring thousands in daily from war-torn regions: outside, charities give out food, clothes and SIM cards, while coaches line up to take travellers off to the countryside or the border.. Although most people come here from the east, a steady stream of people are starting to make the journey in the opposite direction - a potentially lethal choice. . Iryna, her daughter Katerina, mother Lina and mother-in-law Yevgenya are from Kryvyi Rih, a city in central Ukraine close to the front lines. They initially left the country to stay with relatives in Moldova, but have now decided to return. They've had to buy tickets for the trip - in contrast, journeys westward away from the fighting are free.. Iryna says they would have come sooner, but had to wait for her eight-year-old daughter to recover from an illness. \"Home is home,\" she says, when we ask why they've decided to go back. . She admits she's worried about her daughter's safety. When they left, the Russian attacks were far away, but now they're getting closer. . We ask what they've told Katerina about the situation. \"We're telling her the truth,\" Iryna says. . Some warn against moving back east. . Volunteers at a clinic above the main station concourse give out medical and psychological support for new arrivals. Irena Bous is one of them. . Before the war, she was a judge for the International Dance Organization and chair of a number of dance competitions within Ukraine. \"All kinds - hip hop, jazz, break dancing,\" she says. . A friend of hers in the Lviv governor's office knew she had a flair for organisation and so asked her to help out when the Russians invaded. . Irena has met several people who are returning to areas wracked by violence. \"It's a bad idea [to return east],\" Irena says. \"We try to save their lives and keep them in Lviv.\". She tells us of a woman who came to Lviv from her home near Bucha, a wealthy suburb of Kyiv where Russian troops shot dead scores of civilians and left bodies in the street. After nine days, she decided to return - against Irena's advice.. \"I said, please wait, there are no Russians but we have many things there - bombs, mines - wait until they are deactivated,\" Irena says. The woman travelled back regardless, saying her friends had found her a place to stay. . Another woman Irena spoke to, who is in her 60s, had fled to Poland even before the war began, but returned to Ukraine and boarded a train east last week. \"I don't know how long I will live, but I will die in my house,\" she told Irena. . Others we met couldn't bring themselves to leave Ukraine in the first place. At Arena Lviv - a stadium built for the Euro 2012 football tournament, but now playing host to refugees - we meet Roma, a 19-year-old from Mykolaiv on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, and his new friend Iryna, a grandmother from Severodonetsk in the eastern Luhansk region. . The pair had never met until that day, but now they have decided to stay together. Iryna travelled across Ukraine to the Polish border in the days after the invasion, intent on escaping. After queuing for hours, she made it to the front of the line, only to change her mind at the last minute. Her son is in the military in Ukraine and she hears her home city has been recaptured by Ukrainian forces, opening up the prospect of heading home. . \"I couldn't bring myself to leave [the country],\" she tells us. But since then, she has been moving around the west of the country, sleeping for a time at a nursery in Lviv before ending up at the arena with Roma.. A coach destined for the countryside has one spot left on board, but despite repeated offers, Iryna refuses the seat - choosing instead to stick with her new friend. . Now she and Roma - like millions of others - face an uncertain future as displaced people within the country. With a choice of refugee status abroad or rootlessness inside Ukraine, it is perhaps no surprise that some are risking everything to return to their homes. .

        "content": "\"The wonderful woman who cooked at our church and her son, who was in a wheelchair, were both killed when an artillery shell hit their apartment. I now know of several other of our parishioners who have died.\". Like most clergy in the region of north-eastern Ukraine where he is from, Father Pluzhnik belonged to the branch of the Russian Orthodox Church which takes its direction from its religious leadership in Moscow.. But now, he says, has applied to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - which was . , in a move never recognised by Russia. . He says many fellow priests who followed Patriarch Kirill in Moscow are doing the same because of the Church leader's stance on the war.  . Father Pluzhnik and his family fled under artillery fire and now have a temporary new home in the town of Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine.. \"When the war started, I was waiting to hear from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the 'father' of our church. But first there was no reaction at all, and then there was worse,\" he says.. \"Patriarch Kirill blessed the Russian army and gave his blessing to the war. It was not just him but the majority of priests of the Moscow Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church] including some that even have Ukrainian roots. I was in shock.\" . As well as having failed to unequivocally condemn the killing of innocent people in Ukraine, or call for a ceasefire, the Patriarch has held large televised services in Moscow to bless Russian troops. He has also suggested in sermons that the Kremlin's war is a righteous one about the future of Christianity.. \"What is happening today is much more important than politics,\" he said last month. \"We are talking about human salvation, about where humanity will end up and on which side of God the Saviour.\". There are religious undertones in much of the Kremlin's narrative justifying its invasion of Ukraine. It is a fight for the conservative ideals of the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow, against an immoral outside world. President Putin has said Ukraine is not only an \"inalienable part\" of Russia's history and culture - but also its \"spiritual space\".  . The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has said he finds Patriarch Kirill's sentiment concerning.. \"There are elements in the Russian Christian tradition that can become really toxic when they get in their head a particular kind of Christian nationalism, a sort of messianic approach to the fate of the nation,\" said Dr Williams during a visit to western Ukraine this week.. He was part of an extraordinary high-level, multi-faith delegation - including Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist leaders. They met refugees who had fled the horrors in the eastern part of the country.. Dr Williams has long studied and written about the positive contribution of the Russian Orthodox Church, and appears deeply saddened by the role the Moscow Patriarchate is playing in the war.. \"I think that the increasing influence in the Patriarchate of Moscow of ultranationalist ideals - often including a strand of anti-Semitism - has been going on for some time. . \"And it has now expressed itself in this very uncritical support of Russian national ambitions, a very aggressive attitude towards many other Orthodox churches. The writing has been on the wall for some time,\" he said.. Patriarch Kirill has echoed President Putin's claim that Russian speakers and followers of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church living in eastern Ukraine need liberating after years of oppression.. \"Our brothers and sisters were really suffering, they suffer for their loyalty to the Church,\" said Patriarch Kirill a week into the war.. But Father Pluzhnik, a Russian speaker and a follower of the Moscow Patriarchate all of his adult life, is angered by those claims.. \"When I hear them say they are protecting us and fighting some 'Holy War', I think they are either blind, or they are not serving God but the devil,\" he says.. \"We were living peacefully until they came. But far from protecting us they bombed and tortured and killed. Before the war, parishioners were completely free to choose what church they went to, they just went to the church closest to their home. For many of them it was not even a significant difference to go to a church that followed Moscow or not, they just wanted to pray to God. Now that has changed.\" . Dr Sergii Bortnyk, a professor at the Kyiv Theological Academy and an adviser to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, acknowledges that there has been a widespread movement of people and parishes across the country abandoning their loyalty to Moscow.. \"I think it is maybe half of the 12,000 parishes [of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine] that have said that they want to break away now,\" says Dr Bortnyk.. \"Patriarch Kirill has not said anything about all the Christians in Ukraine that have been killed, so I believe the members of our church are free to end their connection to him as the patriarch,\" he says.. \"The connection to all of our [Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox] Church in Ukraine to Moscow is in question now.\". The Kremlin's aim, backed by the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, had been to unite Russia and Ukraine in a single \"spiritual space\".. But the manner by which they have tried to achieve that appears to have had precisely the opposite effect.. ",
