        "content": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has said troops are fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman, in  east.. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister.. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party.. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry. . Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army.. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that \"war dictates personnel policies\". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries.. President Zelensky .  as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government. . At an earlier press conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February.. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine.. The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday.. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine.. \"I am sure that we will win this war,\" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, \"it will cost us more lives\". . Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat.. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area.. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were \"fighting to the last\".. Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago.. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region.. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months.. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: \"Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles.\" But, he added, \"we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning\".. The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town.. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire.. This video can not be played. Watch: Mum turns TV up to hide shelling from daughter. ",

        "content": "He added people with \"homosexual tendencies\" are children of God and should be welcomed by their churches.. His comments were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland.. Archbishop Justin Welby and Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, travelled with the Pope to South Sudan where they jointly called for peace in the war-torn country.. It is the first time the leaders of the three traditions have come together for such a journey in 500 years.. Archbishop Welby and Dr Greenshields praised the Pope's comments during a news conference with reporters on board the papal plane as they travelled from Juba to Rome.. \"I entirely agree with every word he said there,\" said Archbishop Welby, noting that the Anglican church had its own internal divisions over gay rights. . Last month the Church of England said it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to be married in its churches.. Expressing his own support, Dr Greenshields referred to the Bible, saying: \"There is nowhere in the four Gospels that I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whoever he meets, and as Christians that is the only expression that we can give to any human being in any circumstance\".. During the news conference Pope Francis repeated his view that the Catholic Church cannot permit sacramental marriage of same-sex couples.. But he said he supported so-called civil union legislation, and stressed that laws banning homosexuality were \"a problem that cannot be ignored\".. He suggested that 50 countries criminalise LGBT people \"in one way or another\", and about 10 have laws carrying the death penalty.. Currently 66 UN member states criminalise consensual same-sex relations, according to ILGA World - the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.. \"This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God,\" said the Pope.. \"God loves them. God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\". Under current Catholic doctrine, gay relationships are referred to as \"deviant behaviour\" and Pope Francis has previously . .. But some conservative Catholics have criticised him for making comments they say are ambiguous about sexual morality.. In 2013, soon after becoming Pope, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but added that homosexual orientation was not.. Five years later, during a visit to Ireland, Pope Francis stressed that parents could not disown their LGBT children and had to keep them in a loving family.. ",
