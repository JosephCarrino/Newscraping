        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Four US citizens were kidnapped by armed men on 3 March while driving into the city of Matamoros in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, across the border from Texas. . They had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.  . One man, named only as José \"N\", 24, from Tamaulipas, has been arrested.. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: \"We offer our deepest condolences to the friends and families of those who were killed in these attacks.\". The two surviving victims were delivered to the US on Tuesday in co-operation with the US consulate in Matamoros, Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica . .. They were brought back under armed escort by a heavily armed Mexican military convoy.. The FBI later confirmed that two Americans were found dead and that the other two have been brought to American hospitals for treatment. . \"One of the surviving victims sustained serious injuries during the attack,\" the FBI said. . The statement added that the agency will work with international partners and other law enforcement agencies to \"hold those responsible for this horrific and violent attack accountable for their crimes\".   . The bodies of Zindell Brown and Shaeed Woodard have been recovered and are being repatriated, US officials said.. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said: \"We are very sorry that this happened in our country and we send our condolences to the families of the victims, friends, and the United States government, and we will continue doing our work to guarantee peace and tranquillity.\". The injured Americans were named by family members as Latavia \"Tay\" McGee, a mother of six from South Carolina, and Eric James Williams.. The four were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said this week.. Video shows them being loaded into a pickup truck by heavily armed men. One is manhandled on to the vehicle while others appear to be unconscious and are dragged to the truck.. A Mexican woman, believed to be a 33-year-old bystander more than one block away, was killed in last Friday's incident.. At a news conference later on Tuesday, Mexican officials confirmed a 24-year-old man had been arrested and that the four Americans were discovered at a wooden shack outside Matamoros.. The victims had been transferred to various locations between the kidnapping on Friday and their discovery on Tuesday \"to create confusion\", officials say.. Investigators think the Gulf Cartel, one of the oldest organised crime groups in Mexico, is responsible for the attack, a US law enforcement source told CBS. . It is still unclear whether the Americans were ambushed, mistaken for competing drug traffickers, or were caught in cross-fire between warring factions. . US state department officials said on Tuesday that the investigation was still in the early stages. . Ms McGee was said to be travelling to the Mexican border town to have a tummy tuck, a cosmetic surgery procedure to remove abdominal fat.. Her mother Barbara Burgess told ABC News that she had asked her daughter not to go, but her daughter had reassured her she would be safe. . The FBI offered a $50,000 (£42,000) reward for the return of the Americans. . Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US state department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".. Medical tourism is common, particularly among people living in US border states. . But Matamoros is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, as drug cartels control large swathes of the state of Tamaulipas and can hold more power than local law enforcement.   . ",

        "content": "A top congressional Republican gave Mr Carlson exclusive access to the video.. But some Republicans say the Fox host mischaracterised the raid on Congress. . The top-rated host on Fox News, a conservative network, has long insisted that other media outlets exaggerated violence at the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the complex as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. He has also suggested without evidence that government agents could have instigated the riot.. In the roughly 45-minute segment, Mr Carlson said the video showed that while a minority of protesters did commit violence, most were \"sightseers\". . His show on Tuesday night included an interview with Tarik Johnson, a former Capitol Police officer who said he donned a pro-Trump red hat during the riot in order to help fellow officers escape the melee.. Mr Carlson questioned why intelligence about possible violence that day wasn't relayed to rank-and-file officers, but he did not broadcast much new video from the riot. . Criticism of Monday's segment came from Democrats as well as top Republicans in Washington, the head of the Capitol police, and the family of a police officer whose death was mentioned by Mr Carlson in the show.. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday it had been a \"mistake for Fox News to depict this in a way that's completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks\" about the riot. . Mr McConnell pointed to an internal memo by Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, whose agency is responsible for protecting the buildings where the lawmakers meet.. In that memo, Mr Manger says the primetime Monday broadcast was \"filled with offensive and misleading conclusions about the January 6 attack\".. \"The programme conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video,\" he wrote. . \"The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before or during these less tense moments.\". During Monday's programme, the Fox host showed footage of the \"QAnon Shaman\" - a man named Jacob Chansley - wandering around the Capitol building trailed by police officers who show no signs, at least in the clips broadcast, of attempting to stop or arrest him. . Chansley, who was bare-chested and wearing a headdress made of fur and horns that day, became one of the most recognisable figures from the Capitol riot. . He pleaded guilty in September 2021 to obstructing an official proceeding and is currently serving a 41-month prison sentence.. This video can not be played. Jacob Chansley spoke from jail about his role in the Capitol riots.. Mr Carlson said the videos - which have not been viewed by the BBC or any other media organisation in full - showed that police had acted as Chansley's \"tour guide\". . This version of events was rejected by Mr Manger, who called the allegation \"outrageous and false\". . \"Those officers did their best to use de-escalation tactics to try to talk rioters into getting each other to leave the building,\" he wrote.. The justice department says about 140 police officers were assaulted that day. . Around 1,000 people have been arrested so far in connection with the riot, most of them charged with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building, according to justice department figures.. More than 300 have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including more than 100 who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to a police officer. . Mr Carlson also focused on Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed after returning to his office during the siege and died the next day.. Fox News showed footage of Mr Sicknick continuing to perform his duties inside the Capitol after being pepper-sprayed. . \"Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not to do with the violence he suffered outside the Capitol,\" Mr Carlson said. . In April 2021, a medical examiner found that Mr Sicknick had died of natural causes from a medical condition not brought on by an injury.. On Tuesday Mr Sicknick's family issued a statement saying they were \"outraged\" at the coverage and lambasted the network as \"propaganda\".. Meanwhile, there were new revelations on Tuesday night from a $1.6bn (£1.2bn) defamation case filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News. The electronic voting firm accuses the network of promoting baseless claims of vote-rigging.. The latest legal filings in the case reportedly suggest that two days before the Capitol riot Mr Carlson wrote in text about his \"hate\" for Mr Trump, . \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\" he wrote on 4 January 2021, according to US media. \"I truly can't wait.\". \"I hate him passionately,\" he added.. Reports of the filing emerged as Mr Trump himself posted on his social media platform Truth Social in all capital letters: \"Great job by Tucker Carlson tonight.\". ",
