        "content": "Jeon Joo-hwan, 31, was convicted of stabbing the woman to death in a subway restroom in central Seoul last year.. A Seoul court on Tuesday said it had been a \"revenge killing\".. Jeon, a subway worker, had become obsessed with his 28-year-old female co-worker, stalking and threatening her over two years, the court heard. He called his colleague more than 300 times, begging her to date him and threatening to harm her if she refused.. Despite a police investigation and a request to the courts for him to be detained, he was never imprisoned or given a restraining order. Authorities viewed him as \"low-risk\".. He was eventually charged and convicted of stalking. On 14 September, the day before he was due in court to be sentenced on those offences, he tracked down the woman at her work shift in a central Seoul subway station and murdered her in the public bathroom.. \"From the defendant's testimony, it appeared he was determined to murder the victim unless she agreed to settle,\" the Seoul District Central Court said in its verdict, according to Yonhap news agency.. The court heard that Jeon believed the woman owed him damages as he had lost his subway job after she reported him to authorities.. The court on Wednesday also ruled against the prosecutor's demands for a death penalty for Jeon, stating that his young age meant he could still reflect on his crimes and atone for them.. In the aftermath of the murder, there were calls to strengthen South Korea's stalking law, which carries a clause stating that perpetrators can only be prosecuted with the consent of victims.. Critics argued this made it too easy for victims to be bullied into withdrawing their cases.. South Korea's justice ministry has agreed to remove the clause, but the bill is yet to pass parliament.. A fortnight ago, lawyers representing victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence called on lawmakers to pass the bill urgently. They cited the case of another woman who had been recently stabbed by her stalker.. ",

        "content": "Ukraine has warned repeatedly of an . But there is widespread scepticism of significant Russian success.. The UK's .  said Russia's aim was almost certainly to capture parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that were not already under occupation.. But the UK said \"it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks\".. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven Ukrainians towns had been \"liberated\" in recent weeks and operations were progressing \"with success\" in two more, Bakhmut and Vuhledar.. For six months, Russian mercenaries -now joined by regular troops - have tried to capture Bakhmut, a small city with a pre-war population of 70,000. . Now a Ukrainian commander, Denis Yaroslavskiy, has said only 2,000 civilians remain and Russian forces have captured parts of the east and north of the city and continue to move forward.. The head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said this week that Ukrainian forces were not in retreat anywhere in the city and fierce battles were taking place for every street, house and stairwell.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military was paying close attention to Russia's attempt to encircle Bakhmut. \"We are countering them,\" he said on Monday night.. He announced that leaders with military experience were being appointed in border and front-line regions, who could \"prove themselves\" against current threats from Russia.. Ukrainian forces said on Tuesday they had shot down a Russian combat aircraft over Bakhmut, but there was no independent confirmation. . Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured .  north of Bakhmut after an intense battle.. Almost a year into Russia's invasion, an estimated 300,000 Russian reserve troops have been recruited in recent months in an attempt to break through Ukraine's front lines in the east. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.. Mr Haidai said the Russians' two-month training period was coming to an end and Moscow would need around 10 days to transfer them to the front for a new offensive. He suggested that in Luhansk region they would target three towns: Bilohorivka, Kreminna and Svatove.. President Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that will enable Ukraine to double its attack range.. The Russian defence minister warned that Western heavy weapons were drawing Nato countries into the conflict and \"could lead to an unpredictable level of its escalation\".. ",
