        "content": "It is the latest in nearly nightly operations by the Israeli military targeting militants in the territory.. The last two weeks have been a particularly bloody period, with deadly Israeli raids and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday night's operation aimed to arrest a \"Hamas terrorist cell\" which it said was behind a gun attack a week earlier on a restaurant near a Jewish settlement close to Jericho. No-one was injured in that attack.. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is less prominent in the West Bank. Palestinian towns and villages there are mostly governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is dominated by Hamas' secular rival, Fatah.. The raid, coupled with activity by a Hamas cell, is unusual in Jericho, which has a relatively high concentration of Fatah-loyal PA security forces.. Witnesses say there was heavy gunfire during the incident in Jericho's large Aqabat Jabr refugee camp. Bullet holes and bloodstains could be seen in a small house at the centre of the fighting.  . IDF spokesperson Ran Kochav said soldiers \"neutralised the terrorists\", some of whom, he said, had been involved in the attack on the restaurant.. Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said those killed were its fighters.. The governor of Jericho, Jihad Abu al-Assal, said the bodies were taken away by the IDF. Eight people were also arrested, he said. . Israeli-Palestinian tensions have spiralled since an IDF raid against militants in the West Bank city of Jenin 10 days ago left 10 Palestinians, including two civilians, dead. Israeli security services said a \"terror squad\" had been planning an imminent attack.. Hours later, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Jewish worshippers and passers-by outside a synagogue in occupied East Jerusalem, killing seven. The following morning, a 13-year-old Palestinian shot a group of people, also in East Jerusalem, wounding an Israeli father and son.. Later in the day, security camera footage showed a gunman and an accomplice entering the restaurant near Vered Yeriho settlement, where about 30 people were sitting.  . Military sources said the man, armed with an assault rifle, fired one shot in the air before his weapon jammed and the pair left the scene in a car with an Israeli licence plate.. There have been international calls for calm, including from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken who met Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem and the West Bank following the recent bloodshed.. At least 37 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank so far this year, including militants and civilians, as the military continues operations there.. Last year in the West Bank, more than 150 Palestinians were killed, nearly all by Israeli forces. The dead included unarmed civilians, militant gunmen and armed attackers.. Meanwhile, a series of attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs targeting Israelis, as well as militant gunfire at troops during arrest raids, killed more than 30 people including civilians, police and soldiers. .

        "content": "\"Some want to go to Canada, some want to go to warmer states, and we are there for them as they continue to move on with their pursuit of this dream,\" Mr Adams said.. The New York Post has reported that migrants in New York City are being given free bus tickets to Plattsburgh, New York state, about 20 miles (32km) south of the Canadian border. From there, they pay taxis and shuttles to take them to Quebec. . Quebec immigration minister Christine Fréchette told reporters in Montreal that the development was \"surprising\".. She said it highlighted the need to \"solve the problem of Roxham Road\", referring to an unofficial border crossing south of Montreal used by thousands of asylum seekers every year.. \"I think it makes the urgency of the situation even more apparent,\" Ms Fréchette said, adding that Canada and the US were negotiating to update the Safe Third Country Agreement.. The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada. . But it only applies at official border crossings, which Roxham Road is not. This loophole allows the migrants arriving from New York to have their asylum cases heard by Canadian immigration authorities.. New York City has an ongoing migrant crisis, as states on the southern US border bus newly arrived migrants to America's most populous city.. In a January visit to Texas, Mayor Adams told reporters there was \"no room in New York\" for the migrants. . Days before, he had released a statement saying his city had welcomed 40,000 asylum seekers since last spring, providing them with food, shelter and other resources. . \"We are at our breaking point,\" the statement read. \"Based off our projections, we anticipate being unable to continue sheltering arriving asylum seekers on our own and have submitted an emergency mutual aid request to the State of New York.\". Mr Adams confirmed to Fox 5 on Monday that the city was providing free bus tickets for migrants.. \"If they are seeking to go somewhere else, we are helping in the reticketing process,\" he said..

        "content": "Emergency rescue teams said many buildings are damaged or destroyed and that people remain trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,000 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said that families remain trapped under the rubble. . One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP that he lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble.. \"We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,\" he said. \" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery.\". In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region are beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.. Shajul Islam has worked in the intensive care unit of al-Shifa Hospital in Idlib for the past seven years and told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 the current situation in the hospital is the worst he has ever seen.. He said there are currently two to three patients per bed and that people are being taken off ventilators to give to others who have a better chance of surviving. . Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies. . Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",
