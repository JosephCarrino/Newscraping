        "content": "Watch: Zelensky says peace deal would 'leave Ukraine weaker as a state'. In a BBC interview to mark a year since Russia's full-scale invasion, he warned conceding land would mean Russia could \"keep coming back\", while Western weapons would bring peace closer. . Mr Zelensky also said a predicted spring offensive had already begun.. \"Russian attacks are already happening from several directions,\" he said. . He does, however, believe Ukraine's forces can keep resisting Russia's advance until they are able to launch a counter-offensive - although he repeated his calls for more military aid from the West.. \"Of course, modern weapons speed up peace. Weapons are the only language Russia understands,\" Mr Zelensky told the BBC.. He met UK and EU leaders last week in a bid to bolster international support and to ask for modern arms to defend his country. When Ukraine's president asked for modern fighter jets, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing is off the table\".. But Kyiv has become increasingly frustrated with the speed with which Western weapons have arrived. Deliveries of battle tanks - . , including Germany, the US and the UK - are still thought to be weeks away from arriving on the battlefield.. President Zelensky also addressed .  to wage war alongside Russian troops from his territory if a single Ukrainian soldier crossed the border. . \"I hope [Belarus] won't join [the war],\" he said. \"If it does, we will fight and we will survive.\" Allowing Russia to use Belarus as a staging post for an attack again would be a \"huge mistake\", he added.. This video can not be played. Watch: Zelensky warns Belarus against helping Russian offensive. Russian forces launched part of their full-scale invasion from Belarus 12 months ago. They drove south towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv but were fought back and made to retreat within weeks, after suffering heavy casualties.. When asked if he was surprised by Russia's tactics in the war, Mr Zelensky described them as \"valueless\".. \"The way they destroyed everything. If their soldiers received [and carried out] those orders, that means they share those same values.\".  suggested Russian troops in Ukraine were dying in greater numbers this month than at any time since the first week of their invasion. The figures cannot be verified, but the UK's Ministry of Defence said the trends were \"likely accurate\".. \"Today, our survival is our unity,\" said Mr Zelensky on how he thought the war will end. \"I believe Ukraine is fighting for its survival.\" His country was moving towards Europe economically, as well as through its values, he said.. \"We chose this path. We want security guarantees. Any territorial compromises would make us weaker as a state.\". \"It's not about compromise itself,\" he said. \"Why would we be afraid of that? We have millions of compromises in life every day.. \"The question is with whom? With Putin? No. Because there's no trust. Dialogue with him? No. Because there's no trust.\". ",

        "content": "Watch: A quick history of aerial espionage. From birds to balloons, and everything in between.. He said the balloon was used for surveillance, but three other objects shot down over North America were unlikely to be foreign spy crafts.. The US would now improve its detection of similar aerial objects, he said.. Mr Biden also said he would speak with China's President Xi Jinping soon about this month's incident.. \"I hope we are going to get to the bottom of this, but I make no apologies for taking down that balloon,\" Mr Biden said at the White House on Thursday.. China has denied the balloon was used for surveillance, instead saying it blew off course while collecting weather data.. But Mr Biden reiterated the view of US officials that the balloon, which traversed the country at an altitude of about 40,000ft (12,000m) before being blown out of the sky by a US fighter jet over the Atlantic, was in fact used for spying.. He said the US was continuing to speak with China on the issue. \"We are not looking for a new cold war,\" Mr Biden said.. Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure to talk directly to the public about the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon, as well as the three unidentified objects American fighter jets have scrambled to destroy over the past week.. On Thursday afternoon he did that - but his brief appearance will do very little to silence critics or those asking for more information and explanations.. He shed no light on the nature of those objects and provided no further information about the first Chinese balloon. He didn't discuss when the Chinese balloon was first detected, its intended purpose or recent reports that it had been directed toward the US island of Guam but then changed course. Nor did he say why, after a flurry of incidents last week, no new objects have been targeted.. As an explanatory endeavour, it was weak sauce. And as a public-relations effort, it will probably come up short.. It may calm the waters for now, but the next time a balloon floats across the American sky, or fighters scramble and missiles fly, the questions will return with renewed urgency.. Speaking about three other objects subsequently shot down over Alaska, north-west Canada and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border, Mr Biden said the intelligence community believed they were \"most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions\".. Mr Biden's remarks raise the possibility the US used millions of dollars of military equipment against harmless, potentially handmade objects floated by enthusiasts.. Senior House Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut, who is briefed on national security matters, said earlier this week it should not be US policy to use fighter jets to tackle all high-altitude objects.. He told NPR that \"a military mission to shoot down a balloon is a very, very expensive thing\", adding \"we need to think a little bit harder about that\".. Mr Biden said enhanced radar introduced in response to the Chinese balloon might explain the discovery of the three objects.. \"That's why I've directed my team to come back to me with sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.\". This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. Mr Biden's comments came after the White House felt the need to dispel suggestions the three objects were of extra-terrestrial origin.. Officials said the slow-moving unidentified objects did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\" and were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\".. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which was co-ordinating searches for the objects in Canada, said on Thursday it would suspend the search of Lake Huron, in part due to the low probability of recovery.. On whether he would take similar action again, Mr Biden said: \"Make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people I will take it down.\". He declined to say when he planned to speak with China's President Xi when asked during an interview with NBC News.. \"I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with the United States and with me,\" Biden told the broadcaster.. China has repeated its explanation for the balloon shot down on 4 February, with a spokesman telling reporters the US should try to avoid \"misunderstandings and misjudgements\".. Amid the heightened tensions over North American skies, military officials said on Thursday that American warplanes had intercepted Russian jets flying near Alaska for a second time this week. . The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad), which is jointly run by the US and Canada, said in a statement that it was a \"routine\" contact with the Russians.. ",

        "content": "Winds and warmer air and water reduced coverage to just 1.91 million square km (737,000 sq miles) on 13 February.. What is more, the melt still has some way to go this summer.. Last year, the previous record-breaking minimum of 1.92 million sq km (741,000 sq miles) wasn't reached until 25 February. . Three of the last record-breaking years for low sea-ice have happened in the past seven years: 2017, 2022 and now 2023.. Research, cruise and fishing vessels are all reporting a similar picture as they make passage around the continent: most sectors are virtually ice-free. . Only the Weddell Sea remains dominated by frozen floes.. Scientists consider the behaviour of Antarctic sea-ice to be a complicated phenomenon which cannot simply be ascribed to climate change. . Looking at the data from the last 40-odd years of available satellite data, the sea-ice extent shows great variability. A downward trend to smaller and smaller amounts of summer ice is only visible in the past few years.. Computer models had predicted that it would show long-term decline, much like we have seen in the Arctic, where summer sea-ice extent has been shrinking by 12-13% per decade as a result of global warming. . But the Antarctic hasn't behaved like that. . Data sources other than satellites allow us to look back at least as far as 1900.. These indicate Antarctic sea-ice was in a state of decline early in the last century, but then started to increase. . Recently it has shown great variability, with record satellite winter maximums and now record satellite summer minimums as well. . In winter, the floes can cover 18 million sq km (6.9 million sq miles), and more.. It's broadly what this year's summer ice pack is missing compared with the longer-term average. That's enough to cover the British isles.. It will start growing again very soon and it's important that it does… for a host of reasons. . Freezing seawater at the surface of the ocean expels salt, making the water below denser, causing it to sink. . This is part of the engine that drives the great ocean conveyor - the mass movement of water that helps regulate energy in the climate system. . Sea-ice is also hugely important for life at the poles. . In the Antarctic, the algae that cling to the ice are a source of food for the small crustaceans known as krill, which are a basic food resource for whales, seals, penguins and other birds. . The sea-ice is also a platform on which some species will haul out and rest.. It's likely this year's record sea-ice minimum has been influenced by the unusually high air temperatures to the west and east of the Antarctic Peninsula. . These have been 1.5C above the long-term average. . There's also something called the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which is a key player in the region. . It describes variations in atmospheric pressure around Antarctica which in turn influence the continent's famous encircling westerly winds. . The mode is said to be in a strongly positive phase at the moment. . This strengthens the prevailing westerlies and drags them poleward. . Increased storminess helps to break up floes and push them north into warmer waters to melt out. . Researchers think the more positive trends seen in the SAM over the longer term are probably linked to the presence of an ozone hole over Antarctica and the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.. It's important to understand the differences between the poles. . The Arctic is an ocean hemmed in by continents. The Antarctic is a continent surrounded by ocean. . The divergence in geography means ice growth in winter in the Antarctic is much less constrained. The floes can develop as far north as conditions will allow. . This explains the much larger extents than in the Arctic, where the maximums rarely now get above 15 million sq km (5.8 million sq miles). . But the geography also means summer warmth can chase the sea-ice all the way back to the Antarctic coastline in many places. . And because the Antarctic has difficulty retaining ice from year to year, its floes are thinner than in the Arctic - generally just one metre or less, versus 3-4m for long-lived ice in the polar north. .
