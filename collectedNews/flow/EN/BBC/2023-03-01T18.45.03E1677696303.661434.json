        "content": "His wife, Vanessa Bryant, sued, saying first responders photographed human remains as tradable \"souvenirs\".. Lawyers for LA County called the settlement \"fair and reasonable\".. \"Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,\" lawyers for the plaintiff said in a statement on Tuesday.. \"She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.\". In a statement, Mira Hashmall, the lead trial counsel for Los Angeles County in the case, said all county-related litigation from the crash had been resolved.. She said the $28,850,000 settlement included the $16m awarded by a federal jury in August 2022 to Mrs Bryant in her invasion of privacy lawsuit against Los Angeles County. . \"We hope Ms Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss,\" Ms Hashmall said.. Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the 26 January 2020 crash, separately settled with the county for nearly $20m, attorneys told US media on Tuesday. . In March 2021 Mrs Bryant shared the names of four sheriff's deputies she said had distributed \"gratuitous photos of the dead children, parents, and coaches\", who had been travelling to a basketball game.. She said the pictures, including those of her 13-year-old daughter Gianna, were taken and shared \"for no reason other than morbid gossip\".. Mrs Bryant testified at the trial that she had read in media reports how photos of the crash were shown at a pub by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. . \"I live in fear of my daughters being on social media and these popping up,\" she told the court.. California has since passed a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who die at the scene of an accident or crime.. The aircraft in the crash that killed Bryant - a Sikorsky S-76B - went down into a hillside outside the city of Calabasas.. Conditions were foggy when the flight took off, and local police had grounded their helicopters due to the poor weather.. This video can not be played. African basketball stars discuss Kobe Bryant's legacy. ",

        "content": "Iran has said \"unintended fluctuations\" in enrichment levels may have occurred.. It has been openly enriching uranium to 60% purity for two years in breach of a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.. The agreement, which was aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, saw the country limit its nuclear activities and allow monitoring by the IAEA's inspectors in return for relief from crippling economic sanctions.. However, it has been close to collapse since then US-President Donald Trump pulled out unilaterally and reinstated sanctions in 2018 and Iran retaliated by increasingly breaching the restrictions.. , but indirect negotiations in Vienna, where the IAEA is based, have been stalled for a year.. Uranium is a naturally-occurring element that can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by using centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds - to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235.. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.. Highly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more.. Under the nuclear deal, . . . After the US reinstated sanctions, it first resumed enrichment to 20% and then started producing smaller quantities of 60%-enriched material too - a significantly higher level than it had reached before.. The IAEA's latest quarterly report to member states said inspectors found the 83.7%-enriched uranium particles in samples taken at Fordo in late January. . The head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran played down the significance of the discovery and said he expected it to be \"put to rest\" soon.. Mohammad Eslami told reporters on Wednesday that the sample was \"just a particle that cannot even be seen with a microscope\" and insisted that \"the important thing is the volume of product stored\" after enrichment, according to the official Irna news agency.. Iran insists that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful, but experts have warned that the breaches have theoretically reduced the time it would take the country to acquire enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb if it decided to do so. . Top US defence department official Colin Kahl told a Congressional committee hearing on Tuesday that this so-called \"breakout time\" had been shortened from 12 months to \"about 12 days\". . Experts estimate that \"weaponization\" - manufacturing a nuclear warhead for a missile - would still take another one to two years.. ",

        "content": "His main rival Atiku Abubakar polled 29%, and Labour's Peter Obi 25%. . Their parties had earlier dismissed the poll as a sham, and demanded a rerun.. Mr Tinubu urged them to accept the result, but Labour said it was taking legal action to annul his victory. . Mr Tinubu is one of Nigeria's richest politicians, and based his campaign on his record of rebuilding the biggest city, Lagos, when he was governor.. He was nevertheless defeated in the city by Mr Obi, a relative newcomer who mobilised the support of many young people, especially in urban areas, shaking up the country's two-party system.. Mr Tinubu won most other states in his home region of the south-west, where he is known as a \"political godfather\" - for helping to put others into office.. He campaigned for the presidency under the slogan: \"Emi lo kan\", which means \"It's my turn\" in Yoruba.. Scenes of celebration have been reported in Mr Tinubu's strongholds in the south-western states. . Traditional drummers lined the streets, beating their drums for excited dancers in Osun, while supporters marched to a live band in Ekiti. . Some partied into the early hours in Lagos, even though he was defeated by Mr Obi in the city. . The normally bustling streets of Lagos are relatively quiet on Wednesday, the usual rush-hour traffic has not been seen and some shops, businesses and banks have not opened.. Life has returned to normal in places that did not support Mr Tinubu, like the capital, Abuja, and Kano in the north.. In north-eastern Adamawa state, home to Mr Abubakar, there is an air of disappointment in the main city Yola, but grudging acceptance that after several attempts for the presidency, it is time for the former vice-president to move on.. Mr Obi's stronghold in south-eastern Anambra state, where he once served as governor, is quiet but there is an underlying sense of bitter anger. Many feel frustrated at what they see as a fraudulent electoral process.. In his acceptance speech, Mr Tinubu called for reconciliation.. \"I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants to let us team up together. It is the only nation we have. It is one country and we must build it together,\" he said in a televised speech.. He added that they had the right to challenge the results in court but said that the lapses in the election \"were relatively few in number and were immaterial to affect the outcome of this election\".. At a news conference later, Mr Obi's running-mate Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed urged his supporters to stay calm..  Labour's lawyers are \"putting the papers together\" to challenge Mr Tinubu's victory in court, he added.. According to official results, voter turnout was 27%, one of the lowest since the end of military rule in 1999.. With about 8.8 million votes cast for Mr Tinubu, he was the choice of less than 10% of the record 93 million Nigerians who registered to vote, helped by a divided opposition.. A newly introduced electronic voting system seems to have eliminated the ballot-stuffing that happened in the past and helped present a more accurate picture of the voting population.. But given that 87 million people actually collected their voter cards before election day - which was not an easy process and involved queuing for hours - it is more likely that problems on voting day, rather than voter apathy, was responsible for the low number of ballots cast.. Many potential voters left polling stations without casting their ballots after voting did not start on time in many places. . In some opposition strongholds, voting did not take place at all and there were also cases of ballot-box snatching and voter intimidation in southern states such as Rivers, Lagos and Delta.. President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two terms in office, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east to a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. Mr Tinubu now has the task of solving these problems, among others, in Africa's most populous nation and biggest oil exporter.. After fighting military rule in Nigeria, escaping into exile and being one of the founding members of the country's democracy in 1999, Mr Tinubu will feel that he was destined to become president.. He was always the favourite to replace Mr Buhari - whom he helped become president - and the hurdles he has surmounted to get here will make this an even sweeter win for him.. He was not expected to win the party primary, yet he won.. Many said his decision to go with another Muslim as a running mate would prove an obstacle, but it was not.. Previously all major parties have split their presidential tickets with a Christian from the south and a northern Muslim in order to achieve broad support across this vast nation of 210 million people.. He will now have to prove that he can hit the ground running and that he is still the same formidable force who built modern Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.. Mr Tinubu, known as \"Jagaban\" by supporters, will now be looking at unifying a country that is retreating into regional lines and religious blocs, as the election results show.. While he met the 25% requirement in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to show he was nationally accepted, the nature of the win indicates the absence of a truly national party.. Mr Obi won in Christian-dominated states and former strongholds of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the south, while the PDP support shrank back into its northern heartlands. . ",

        "content": "The protesters believe the sweeping changes being pushed through parliament will undermine judicial independence and threaten democracy.. Ministers say they will restore balance between the branches of government.  . They have described the protesters as \"anarchists\".. Live footage from Tel Aviv showed a number of scuffles as police dragged away demonstrators. Officers on horseback tried to stop some breaking through barricades.. Speaking on Israeli Channel 13 TV, one protester called Zeev commented: \"This is terrible violence, no-one touched the policemen. We were in a protest of civil people. We didn't expect such a thing.  We are here to support democracy.\". However, the far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said police had been \"very patient\" and had barriers and stones thrown at them. . He backed the measures being used, saying the force \"must use all the means at its disposal to maintain public order and the daily routine of Israeli citizens\".. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on Twitter: \"The right to protest is not the right to anarchy.\". In parliament, which is in Jerusalem, members of the opposition boycotted a vote by the constitution, justice and law committee as it gave initial approval to more proposals in the judicial reforms plan.. Changes to the justice system are a cornerstone of the policy of Israel's new nationalist-religious coalition led by Mr Netanyahu.. They aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. Critics say that this endangers the political system of checks and balances, given that Israel has no constitution and only one parliamentary chamber that is controlled by the ruling coalition.. Tens of thousands of people have turned out for weekly mass rallies against the new legislation in recent weeks.. At times on Thursday, protesters brought traffic to a halt on the busy main route between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.. Many waved the blue and white Israeli flag. Shouts of \"democracy\" went up and \"Israel is not a dictatorship, Israel is not Hungary\" - whose right-wing nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has been accused of undermining democratic institutions, including the judiciary.. Polls have suggested the government's plan is not popular and most Israelis would prefer a compromise to be reached.. President Isaac Herzog, who serves in a mainly figurehead role, has been pushing for dialogue between the government and the opposition, warning that the country is on the brink of \"constitutional and social collapse\".. Many of Israel's foreign allies have expressed concern about the new legislation. . \"Slow down a little a bit, maybe bring people together, try and build some consensus,\" US ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said this week.. Meanwhile, veterans of an elite Israeli military intelligence unit, Unit 8200, have joined a growing list of army reservists threatening to refuse to perform reserve service in protest. . \"It's completely unusual,\" one reserve officer told the BBC. \"We tend to remain impartial in these matters but it's not a routine political debate. It's a dramatic change. We are worried that our crucial principles of democracy will be completely ruined.\". Workers in high-tech, lawyers and bankers have also expressed alarm about the impact, including on the economy. . Mr Netanyahu - who is on trial for corruption, which he denies - says the changes will boost business.. ",

        "content": "It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.. Many scientists point out there is no evidence that it leaked from a lab.. And other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI's.. Some of them have said - but with a low level of certainty - that the virus did not start in a lab but instead jumped from animals to humans.. The White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the origins.. A joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) investigation in 2021 called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\".. However, the WHO investigation was deeply criticised and its director-general has since called for a new inquiry, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\". Mr Wray's comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to \"be more honest\" about Covid's origins.. In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China \"has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. . He said details of the agency's investigation were classified but the FBI had a team of experts focusing on the dangers of biological threats.. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\".. \"The conclusions they have reached have no credibility to speak of,\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. A few days ago, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan but could only reach that conclusion with \"low confidence\".. In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said this week that there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at University of Glasgow.. \"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.. On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports \"a whole-of-government effort\" to discover how Covid began.. \"We're just not there [at consensus] yet,\" he said. \"If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.\". Tensions in bilateral ties between the US and China have spiked in the wake of the recent spy balloon saga.. A bipartisan panel of US lawmakers this week kicked off a series of hearings on the \"existential\" threat of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.. The first session of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party focused on issues such as human rights and the US economy's dependence on Chinese manufacturing.  .
