It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. The move came as the firm, a key tech lender, was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. \"The US banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,\" the authorities' joint statement said.. \"Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe.\". SVB was seen as a crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector. It was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. . But it came under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Meanwhile, . .

        "content": "He was arrested in 2014 while crossing the border from Jordan into Saudi Arabia, accused of smuggling amphetamines.   . He was later sentenced to death, after a trial criticised by Amnesty International as \"grossly unfair\".  . His sister, Zeinab Abul Al-Khair, said he had told her from jail that he had been strung up by his feet and beaten.  . \"He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" she told me earlier this year.. His case has drawn international concern, with fears for his fate growing after Saudi Arabia last November ended an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty for drugs offences. Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed on such charges.. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had found that Mr Abu al-Khair's detention lacked legal basis.   . And in late 2022, the UN Human Rights office appealed for his release.  . It says the use of the death penalty for drug offences is incompatible with international norms and standards.. \"We urge the Saudi government to halt al-Kheir's reported imminent execution and to comply with the Working Group's opinion by quashing his death sentence, releasing him immediately and unconditionally, and by ensuring that he receives medical care, compensation and other reparations,\" said spokesperson Liz Throssell.. The announcement that Hussein Abu al-Khair had been put to death was made on the Saudi press agency and comes a year to the day since the biggest mass execution in modern Saudi history.. Campaign group Reprieve said the Saudi authorities had not warned his family that he was about to be executed - or given them the chance to say goodbye. . It has been highly critical of Saudi Arabia's allies, including the UK, for not taking a stronger stand against human rights abuses in the Kingdom. . \"Exactly a year ago, Mohammed bin Salman's regime executed 81 men in a single day, and Saudi Arabia's international partners shrugged and issued empty statements about the importance of human rights,\" said Reprieve's director, Maya Foa.  . \"Rather than condemn the Crown Prince, world leaders queued up to shake his bloodstained hands. Today's atrocity and others like it is the inevitable result. When partners signal that the Saudi regime can kill without consequences, you can be sure it will,\" she added. . Mr Abu al-Khair's case was raised in the UK parliament in late November - with a Foreign Office minister answering an Urgent Question about a surge of executions in Saudi Arabia by saying that the authorities had \"clearly\" tortured him and describing his treatment as \"abhorrent\".. The following week the minister, David Rutley, asked for his words to be struck from the parliamentary record, . Responding to news of the execution, Conservative MP David Davis said: \"The UK government knew Hussein Abu al-Khair was at imminent risk, but the foreign secretary failed to publicly call for his execution to be halted, despite his predecessors taking this kind of action in the past. . \"The UK must signal it will no longer turn a blind eye to executions like these, and speak out strongly on behalf of others who remain at risk, including child defendants like Abdullah al-Howaiti.\". The Saudi Press Agency said the Ministry of the Interior was announcing that the death penalty had been implemented against Hussein Abu al-Khair to \"confirm the keenness of the Kingdom's government to combat drugs of all kinds because of the severe harm they cause to the individual and society\"..

Emergency responders from several agencies found two overturned boats with bodies spread over an area of 400 yards (366m), and a search operation continued into Sunday morning. .

        "content": "\"I think you are a Russian journalist. You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,\" said one social media user who claimed to be from the port city.. Russian forces put the people of Mariupol through a horrific months-long siege, before eventually capturing it last May.. I eventually found three residents willing to speak to me at length: a local city councillor, a retired pensioner and an engineer. All spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from the local authorities installed by Russia (who block access to occupied Ukraine by Western journalists).. They paint a picture of a massively expensive campaign conducted by Russia to win over the hearts and minds of the people of Mariupol, and rebuild a city damaged beyond recognition by Russia's own troops.. The purpose of this campaign is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia's own.. Their accounts corroborate each other, and are confirmed by social media posts about recent developments in Mariupol.. Before this war began about half a million people lived in the city.. According to UN estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed, and 350,000 people were forced to leave after Russia attacked in February 2022. . It is difficult to estimate the exact number of people killed as a result of the relentless shelling of Mariupol, but Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 died there. . Russian-installed authorities in Mariupol say some 300,000 people are now living there.. The people who spoke to me from Mariupol said their city had been inundated with labourers from across Russia, as well as from Central Asia. . Oleg Morgun, the Russia-installed \"mayor\" of Mariupol, says some 70,000 of those currently in the city are construction workers and members of the Russian military.. New buildings have appeared and many buildings damaged during the bombardment have gone.. For example, the Russian military has built a whole new district comprised of a dozen apartment blocks in the western part of Mariupol. It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.. \"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we're part of Russia now,\" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.. \"I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.\". In the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.. Heating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.. Many schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.. Maria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: \"It's so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares.\" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.. Russian has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.  . The fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.. The Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.. There are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.. For example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.. Ivan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed \"huge queues\" trying to get Russian passports.. They were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.. Also, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as \"filtration\", he added.. \"So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.. Mariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.. Russia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.. Russian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.. The media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.. Many current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.. \"We've suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,\" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.. The fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.. \"I'm sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,\" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). \"I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now.\" . City councillor Ivan said: \"It's become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It's tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.\". Those who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.. Popular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.. \"If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn't reconstruction. It's not something they can be thanked for,\" he said.. \"You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?\" he said. . \"You can't rebuild them. You can't bring them back.\". ",

        "content": "Gulnara Karimova used UK companies to buy homes and a jet with funds obtained through bribery and corruption, the Freedom For Eurasia study says.. It adds that accounting firms in London and the British Virgin Islands acted for UK companies involved in the deals.. The story raises fresh doubts about the UK's efforts to tackle illegal wealth. . British authorities have long been accused of not doing enough to prevent criminals from overseas using UK property to launder money.. The report says the ease with which Karimova obtained UK property was \"concerning\".. There is no suggestion that those acting for the companies linked to her were aware of any connection to her nor that the source of funds could have been suspicious. No-one who provided those services in the UK has been investigated or fined. . For a time Gulnara Karimova was tipped to succeed her father, Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan as president of the central Asian state from 1989 until his death in 2016. She appeared in pop videos under the stage name \"Googoosha\", ran a jewellery company and served as ambassador to Spain. . But then in 2014 she disappeared from public view. It later emerged she had been detained on corruption charges while her father was still in power and she was sentenced in December 2017. In 2019 she was sent to prison for breaching the terms of her house arrest. . Prosecutors accused her of being part of a criminal group that controlled assets of more than $1bn (£760m) in 12 countries, including the UK, Russia and United Arab Emirates. \"The Karimova case is one of the largest bribery and corruption cases of all time,\" says Tom Mayne, one of the researchers on the Freedom For Eurasia report and a research fellow at the University of Oxford. . This video can not be played. Googoosha in the video for her single Round Run. However, Karimova and her associates had already sold some of the property allegedly acquired with corrupt funds.. Freedom For Eurasia researched property and land registry records to identify at least 14 properties which it says were purchased before she arrested, with allegedly suspicious funds, in various countries, including the UK, Switzerland, France, Dubai and Hong Kong.. The report to be published on Tuesday 14 March, titled Who Enabled the Uzbek Princess?, focuses on five properties bought in and around London, now worth an estimated £50m - including three flats in Belgravia, just west of Buckingham Palace, a house in Mayfair and an £18m Surrey manor house with a private boating lake.. Two of the Belgravia flats were sold in 2013 before Karimova was detained. In 2017, the house in Mayfair, the Surrey mansion and a third flat in Belgravia were frozen by the Serious Fraud Office. . Freedom For Eurasia's report also names firms in London and the British Virgin Islands that it claims were used by Karimova or associates to enable them to spend the proceeds of crime on the properties as well as on private jetliner. . Karimova's boyfriend, Rustam Madumarov, and others now alleged to be associates of hers were listed in official documents as the \"beneficial owners\" - a legal term for the person who ultimately is in control - of companies based in the UK, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands. But the report says they were just proxies for Karimova, who used the firms to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.. Accountancy services for two UK companies linked to Karimova - Panally Ltd and Odenton Management Ltd - were provided by SH Landes LLP, a firm formerly located on New Oxford Street in London.. In late July 2010, SH Landes sought to register or acquire another company. The aim was to purchase a private jet for around $40m (£33m), with Madumarov named as the beneficial owner. In fact, according to the report, Karimova was really behind the purchase.. When asked at the time about the source of his funds, SH Landes replied: \"We believe that the question regarding his personal wealth is not relevant in this situation.\" This was seemingly because the money to buy the jet were not being provided by Madumarov out of his personal funds.. The London-based firm later said Madumarov's wealth came partly from a mobile phone company based in Uzbekistan, Uzdonrobita. Questions had already been raised about the company's possible links to Karimova. As far back as 2004, an article for the Moscow Times had alleged that Karimova siphoned some $20m out of Uzdunrobita using fraudulent invoices. A former adviser had also accused Karimova of \"racketeering\".. Because it was a high-value transaction linked to a high-risk jurisdiction, Uzbekistan, the report argues that SH Landes should have conducted \"enhanced due diligence\" - thorough background checks to ensure the source of funds was legitimate and not derived from criminal activity.. SH Landes also submitted the 2012 financial statements for Panally Ltd. The report says in September 2013 they were signed off by a close associate of Karimova's: Gayane Avakyan, then aged 30.. The previous year, the BBC had .  that Avakyan was the registered beneficial owner of Takilant, a Gibraltar-registered company at the centre of \"a high-level multi-million dollar fraud and corruption scandal in Uzbekistan\". . In a statement to the BBC, Steven Landes said: \"SH Landes LLP was never engaged by Gulnara Karimova. SH Landes LLP did act on behalf of Rustam Madumarov.. \"SH Landes LLP obtained due diligence on all its clients and relevant regulatory authorities were notified and kept appraised.\". Tom Mayne of Freedom For Eurasia said the apparent ease with which Karimova managed to buy so much UK property was concerning.. \"It took the authorities until 2017 to do anything, years after other countries had already frozen bank accounts and properties that belonged to her,\" he added. .
