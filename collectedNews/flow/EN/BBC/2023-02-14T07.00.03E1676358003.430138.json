        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spokeswoman. Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\", said US Northern Command.. The FBI is examining the items, which the US says were used to spy on sensitive military sites. . The US has shot down three more objects since the first one on 4 February.. \"Large sections of the structure\" were also recovered on Monday off the coast of South Carolina, military officials say.. About 30-40ft (9-12m) of the balloon's antenna array are among the items found, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.. US officials said the high-altitude balloon originated in China and was used for surveillance, but China said it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown astray.. Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border.. In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-22 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources. The second missile hit the target, according to reports.. Each Sidewinder missile costs over $400,000 (£330,000).. Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the original balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target. . White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down \"out of an abundance of caution\".. They did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\", he said.. The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses. . The second object, over Alaska, was described by officials as the size of a \"small car\". The third object, over the Yukon, was \"cylindrical\". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be \"octagonal\" with strings attached. . This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. The recovery of the balloon shot down on 4 February was delayed amid foul weather.  . Efforts are under way to collect debris from where the other objects were blown out of the sky.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles), including \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sean McGillis said there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote locations. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost said all three of the most recent objects to be shot down appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discovered debris should contact the police directly.. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday. . Amid the row over high-altitude aircrafts, America's top diplomat cancelled a visit to Beijing that was initially planned for last week.. ",

Mr Saied says he wants to save the north African nation from chaos.. The country's biggest opposition party Ennahda has described the detentions as the \"kidnapping of Saied's opponents\".. Many Tunisians who supported Mr Saied when he came to power in 2019 have recently turned against the president.. In 2021, Mr Saied sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and pushed through a constitution enshrining his one-man rule.. The new constitution replaced one drafted soon after the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which saw Tunisia overthrow late dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. . It gives the head of state full executive control and supreme command of the army.. Last month, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Tunis, demanding the resignation of Mr Saied's government.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Rescue teams freed him from the rubble of his home in the now devastated city of Kahramanmaras, 105 hours after the earthquake. . When he was brought into the intensive care unit, hypothermia had set in and his body temperature had dropped to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit).. Aras may have survived, but his seven-year-old sister Hiranur did not. Neither did his nine-year-old brother Alp. Nor his father. . Just one of so many families irrevocably broken by this disaster.. Sitting at Aras's bedside and gently ruffling his grandson's dark hair Is Mehmet.. \"He's an honest boy. He has a strong personality. He's sincere. He's not a spoilt boy.\" . Although now 72, Mehmet tells us he will for the rest of his days look after Aras as if he were his own son. . \"The rescuers did so well to save him,\" he says, \"and by God's grace, they gave him back to us alive.\" . Aras winces a little as the doctor changes the bandage on his swollen left foot. He's making a good recovery. . Aras's mum also survived - but he hasn't seen her since their world imploded. She is being treated at another hospital in the city but is expected to recover.. It was in an intensive care unit set up by Israeli doctors where Aras's own life was saved. . But as we walked through the ward on Monday, it was not just a child with a remarkable story but also a 65-year-old man. . Samir from Syria was plucked from the rubble after enduring six freezing nights. . Doctors then saved him, but both his legs had to be amputated. . For the medics at the heart of this disaster it's been an exhausting and traumatic week. . Paediatrician Dr Mehmet Cihan travelled from Istanbul as quickly as he could to help colleagues in this broken city. . \"It's very bad. Too many children have lost their parents. I don't know. It's very hard for me... too hard for me.\". The international medical effort reaches far beyond Kahramanmaras. . In the town of Turkoglu, green British tents pitched by NHS doctors stand alongside Turkish tents with red tarpaulin. . UK doctors are setting up a field hospital in the grounds of the town's hospital which was damaged in the quake. . The need for emergency care in the hours after the earthquake may have passed - but 80,000 people living here are lacking many medical services.. Dr Bryony Pointon is a GP from Chichester, who has come to Turkey as part of UK-Med - a front-line medical aid charity funded by the British government.. \"We are working with the Turkish doctors and nurses that are here - setting up their own tents and seeing patients but they are quite overwhelmed,\" she explains. . \"After all the trauma you have the people who have their usual chronic illnesses - they are still unwell, they don't have the facilities to cope. So, we will see those patients, as many as we can.\". Doctors and nurses from around the world are now in Turkey to help with the physical injuries. . But the mental trauma is also profound - both the personal and the national.. ",
