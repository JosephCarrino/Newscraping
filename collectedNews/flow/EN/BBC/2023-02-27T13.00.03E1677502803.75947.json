        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. At least 62 migrants are confirmed to have died, with 12 children said to be among the victims, including a baby.. The vessel, thought to have carried some 200 people, broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. . People from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran were said to be on board.. Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region. . The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remain unaccounted for.. One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Many of those on board were thought to be from Pakistan. Its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said more than two dozen Pakistanis were believed to have been among those who drowned, and has asked diplomats to verify the facts as soon as possible. . As assistance and relocation operations continue, a group of survivors of the deadly shipwreck are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones. . At a temporary reception centre in the town of Isola di Capo Rizzuto, some of them were crying without speaking, some were just staring into the void, wrapped in blankets. . \"They are heavily traumatised\" said Sergio Di Dato, from charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). \"Some children have lost their whole family. We are offering them all the support we can.\". A 16-year-old boy from Afghanistan lost his 28-year-old sister, who died on the beach next to him. He can't find the strength to tell his parents. . A 43-year-old man from Afghanistan survived with his 14-year-old son, but his wife and his three other children, who were 13, nine, and five did not make it. Another Afghan woman in tears would not move from the beach after losing her husband..  \"This is yet another tragedy happening near our shores. It reminds us all that the Mediterranean is a giant mass grave, with tens of thousands of souls in it, and it continues to widen,\" said Francesco Creazzo, spokesman for SOS Méditerranée, an NGO engaged in rescue operations in the central Mediterranean. . \"There is no end in sight; in 2013, people said 'never again' to the little white coffins of Lampedusa, in 2015, they said 'never again' in front of the lifeless body of a two-year-old Syrian child on a beach. Now the words 'never again' are not even pronounced any more. We only hear 'no more departures', but unfortunately people keep venturing on this journey and they keep dying,\"  he added. . Speaking at the UN's Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday morning, Secretary General António Guterres called on countries to do more to help refugees and migrants, and for safer travel routes and strengthened rescue operations. . \"Just yesterday [Sunday], yet another horrific shipwreck in the Mediterranean claimed the lives of scores of people seeking a better future for themselves and their children. Refugee and migrant rights are human rights,\" he said.. He added that while criminal gangs controlled migration routes, people would continue to die: \"We need safe, orderly, legal routes for migrants and refugees. And we must do everything possible to prevent the loss of life by providing search and rescue and medical care.\". Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - on Sunday expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement.. \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. The vessel, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. ",

The participants of the operation are Belarusian\", Mr Azarov said.. Speaking to the BBC, Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader, said the attack was \"creative\" and \"sophisticated\".. \"It was very brave because Belarusians are in a situation of the total terror\", he told BBC News. . He added that the opposition party was \"definitely helped by locals, helped by military\" to cause damage to the plane.. However, it is not possible to confirm the opposition's account of what happened. . Both the Russian and Belarusian departments of defence are yet to publicly comment on the incident. . BYPOL, the group that has claimed responsibility for the strike on the aircraft, consists of former law enforcement officers now opposed to President Alexander Lukashenko's office. . It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko's government. . While Belarus has not directly become involved in the war in Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to launch into Ukraine through Belarus.. The two countries have also been participating in joint military training exercises over recent months. . ",

        "content": "Michelle Yeoh was named best actress, beating frontrunner Cate Blanchett.. \"This is not just for me, it's for every little girl who looks like me,\" Yeoh said in her emotional acceptance speech.. Her co-star Ke Huy Quan became the first Asian winner of best supporting actor, while there was a shock win for his co-star Jamie Lee Curtis in the supporting actress category.. Everything Everywhere All At Once follows a laundrette owner - played by Yeoh - who must tap into different versions of herself from the multiverse in order to save the world. . The sci-fi adventure's victory gives it significant momentum ahead of the Oscars on 12 March, and indicates it is the clear frontrunner to win best picture. Its four SAG awards are the most ever won by single film.. There was only one winner in SAG's film acting categories who was not from Everything Everywhere All At Once - Brendan Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale.. In her speech, Yeoh told the audience - which was largely made up of fellow actors - that \"we're here because we love what we do, we will never stop doing what we do\".. \"Thank you for giving me a seat at the table, because so many of us need this, we want to be seen, we want to be heard, and tonight you have shown us that it is possible,\" she said.. The prize for best film cast is seen as the top honour at the SAG Awards in the absence of a best picture category. Winners at the annual ceremony, held in Los Angeles, are voted for by other actors.. Veteran actor James Hong, 94, who plays Yeoh's father in Everything Everywhere, gave a comical acceptance speech, in which he vowed to return to the ceremony when he was 100 years old.. \"I got my first SAG card 70 years ago. Back in those days... producers said that Asians were not good enough and they are not box office - but look at us now,\" he said to cheers from the audience.. The film's SAG honour was the second major accolade it achieved this weekend. On Saturday, it won . , another valuable indicator of Academy Awards success.. In her own acceptance speech, Curtis said: \"I love acting, I love the job we get to do, I love being a part of a crew, part of a cast, I love what we do with each other, it's such a beautiful job... what a dream.\". Curtis, who is the daughter of two actors, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, also made light of .  about stars who arguably had an advantage in their careers because they have famous parents.. \"I know you look at me and think 'well, nepo baby, that's why she's there', and I get it,\" Curtis said. \"But the truth of the matter is, I'm 64 years old and this is just amazing.\" The actress .  as a \"nepo baby\" earlier in the ceremony.. Her victory, together with that of Kerry Condon at last week's Baftas, casts significant doubt over the supporting actress category ahead of the Oscars. Wakanda Forever's Angela Bassett had previously been considered the most likely winner. . Curtis's co-star Ke Huy Quan scored a historic victory as he was named best supporting actor, becoming . \"When I heard that, I quickly realised that this moment no longer belongs to just me. It also belongs to everyone who has asked for change,\" Quan said as he collected his trophy. \"This is a really emotional moment for me.\". Quan rose to fame as a child star in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but he took a break from acting later in his career until returning with Everything Everywhere All At Once.. \"When I stepped away from acting, it's because there were so few opportunities,\" he said. \"And yet here we are tonight, the landscape looks so different now than before. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes.\" . Elsewhere, Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale, beating Austin Butler, the young actor who has triumphed at several other precursor ceremonies for his performance as Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann's biopic.. \"I will treasure this but never more than what I used to keep in my wallet, which was my SAG card, that I earned in 1991,\" Fraser recalled, becoming visibly emotional. \"It made me feel like I belonged. If you told that guy back then, that I'd be standing here right now, I would not have believed you.\". He described the role of Charlie, the morbidly obese professor he portrays in The Whale, as \"the role of my life\".. Fraser's win continues a hugely successful comeback for the actor, who was a box office star at the turn of the millennium with films such as The Mummy and George of the Jungle.. But the 54-year-old then spent several years out of the spotlight, taking on smaller roles as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, until he was cast as the lead in Darren Aronofsky's film.. \"I just want you to know, all the actors out there who have gone through that or are going through that, I know how you feel, but believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go,\" Fraser said.. In the TV categories, acting winners included Jessica Chastain (for George & Tammy), Jason Bateman (Ozark), Sam Elliott (1883) and Jean Smart (Hacks). . The top two TV prizes - best drama series and best comedy series - were won by wealth satire The White Lotus and school-based sitcom Abbott Elementary respectively.. The White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge, who won best actress in a drama series, used her acceptance speech to recount the story of when her usually rule-abiding father let her skip school to attend the Charlie Chaplin film festival. . \"He got me out of my first grade class to do it,\" she said, \"and seeing Charlie Chaplin for the first time and having that experience, my love of film, my love of actors, all of that came from my first grade.\". Andrew Garfield presented the lifetime achievement award to Sally Field, who told the crowd: \"In all of these almost 60 years there is not a day that I don't feel quietly thrilled to call myself an actor.\". Famous faces including Robbie Coltrane, Ray Liotta, James Caan, Dame Olivia Newton John, Irene Cara, Annie Wersching and Dame Angela Lansbury also featured in the show's In Memoriam segment.. The SAG Awards and the Bafta Film Awards are both seen as Oscar indicators - but this year, none of the major winners overlapped.. Last week's Baftas were instead dominated by The Banshees of Inisherin and All Quiet On The Western Front, while Everything Everywhere took only one of the 10 awards it was nominated for.. It leaves the awards race wide open ahead of the Oscars, with no actor this year having won their category across the Golden Globes, Critics Choice, SAG Awards and Baftas..

The Israeli military said it was continuing to search for the Palestinian who shot Hillel Yaniv, 22, and Yagel Yaniv, 20, and that it had moved in extra troops. . Earlier on Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a summit in Jordan.. Videos posted hours after the summit ended showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.  . A Palestinian official who monitors settlements in the Nablus region, Ghassan Daghlas, told Palestinian Wafa news agency that 30 houses were damaged by stones or burned down, and that 15 vehicles were torched. . Settlers also set a barn and three vehicles on fire in nearby Burin, as well as a house and a water tank in Asira al-Qabaliyya, he said.. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara.. This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\".. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis.. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don't take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement.. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on the brothers, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles (2km) south of Nablus.. The two men were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times. . No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions' Den.. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in Nablus last Wednesday in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005. . Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians.. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. ",
