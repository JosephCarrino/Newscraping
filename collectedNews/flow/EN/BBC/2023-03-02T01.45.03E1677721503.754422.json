        "content": "It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter sends video from scene of fatal crash. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke after visiting the site of Tuesday night's head-on collision between a passenger service and a freight train. . The local stationmaster has been charged with manslaughter. The Greek transport minister has resigned.. Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors.. The accident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. The passenger train carrying some 350 people collided with a freight train as it emerged from a tunnel after leaving the town of Larissa.. It is still unclear why the two services were running on the same track.. The stationmaster, who is in charge of signalling, denies wrongdoing and has blamed the accident on a possible technical failure.. After visiting the site, Mr Mitsotakis said everything pointed to \"a tragic human error\".. \"Justice will do its job,\" he said in a televised address. \"People will be held accountable, while the state will be on the side of the people.\" . Announcing his resignation, Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated: \"When something so tragic happens, it is impossible to continue and pretend it didn't happen.\" . Trade unions said collisions have multiple factors and the crash had highlighted chronic deficiencies, including lack of staff, broken signals and outdated facilities.. The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed and the first two caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\", Thessaly regional governor Kostas Agorastos said.. The train was travelling from Athens to Thessaloniki, which has a sizeable student population, and it is believed many on board were students returning there after a holiday for Greek Orthodox lent.. Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\".. Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage, told Reuters news agency: \"The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Larissa's mayor said some of those who died would only be identifiable through genetic testing.. Relatives of missing passengers have provided DNA samples to help the identify bodies, a hospital in Larissa said. . ",

        "content": "Many Iranians suspect the poisonings are a deliberate attempt to force girls' schools to close. . But the government has not said whether it believes they are premeditated. . Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, who has been tasked by the president with finding the \"root cause\" of the poisonings, on Wednesday dismissed as \"false\" a report by Fars news agency that three people had been arrested.. He also accused foreign-based and \"mercenary groups\" of taking advantage of the situation to wage psychological war and worry people.. Some pupils and parents suggested that schoolgirls may have been targeted for taking part in recent anti-government protests.. At least 26 schools in five cities across Iran were affected by the latest gas poisonings, local media and activists said.. BBC Persian verified videos showing ambulances arriving at schools and students being treated in hospitals in the capital Tehran, the north-western city of Ardabil and the western city of Kermanshah. . In one from Tehransar, in western Tehran, several girls purportedly from 13 Aban School are seen . .. Another video from the city's east shows . . A mother is then seen rushing up to the gate and screaming: \"Where is my child?\" A man replies: \"They've poisoned the students with gas.\". Authorities are under increasing pressure from the public to stop the poisonings, which were initially concentrated in the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Tehran.. Research by BBC Persian established that at least 830 students, mostly schoolgirls, had been poisoned as of Sunday, while a member of parliament put the figure at 1,200 in Qom and the western city of Borujerd alone as of Tuesday.. Those affected have reported the smell of tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill.. The chairman of the parliamentary education committee, Alireza Monadi-Sefidan, was quoted by Fars as saying on Tuesday that an investigation had found that the toxic gas contained nitrogen.. However, the interior minister told reporters on Wednesday that reports saying a specific chemical substance had been detected were incorrect.. One parent told the BBC that girls at their daughter's school in the Tehran suburb of Pardis were poisoned on Tuesday. . \"My daughter and two of her friends say they heard something like an explosion and immediately afterwards an unpleasant smell - something like burned plastic filled the air,\" said the parent, who the BBC is not identifying for safety reasons. . \"They were asked to leave the class and go into the yard. Many of the students started collapsing in the yard. There are kids with asthma and heart problems in my daughter's class.\" . \"Ambulances and the police arrived. Kids were given milk by the ambulance staff.\". On Sunday, Deputy Health Minister Younes Panahi said it was \"evident that some people wanted all schools, especially girls' schools, to be closed down\", although he later said that his remarks had been misunderstood.. Some people have speculated that the schoolgirls are being targeted as \"payback\" for their role in the mass protests that erupted in September after the death in custody of, Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf \"properly\".. Authorities have portrayed the protests as \"riots\" and responded with lethal force. Human rights groups have reported that hundreds of protesters have been killed, among them dozens of children. . In another video posted online on Wednesday, . , and that their headteacher then announced that some students were unwell and ambulances were being called. . The woman then talks to a young girl, who wonders whether they were \"chosen\" because they had taken part in the protests. . Public anger at the poisonings and the authorities' response have prompted fresh unrest. . A second video from Tehransar on Wednesday showed .  - the main slogan of the protest movement - as well as \"Death to the child-killing government.\" . The parent from Pardis said: \"We arrived at the school, angry and worried. Parents started shouting slogans against [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei.\" . \"Nobody believes they will investigate these attacks,\" they added. \"I have no hope in the system. But I hope the world will hear our voice and stop supporting these child killers.\". Officials reported that 35 students from their daughter's school were taken to hospital after the poisoning. But the parent said the actual number was much higher. . \"From my conversations with parents and the school principal, half of the students were taken to hospitals. That is at least 200 students.\". One of those children was in a coma, they said, adding: \"Some parents have also refused to take their children to hospital because they are afraid and don't trust the officials.\". ",

        "content": "The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders.. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea.. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea's son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk. . The OCCRP claimed in a .  that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports.. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material.. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials.. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.  . NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa.. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle.. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. . The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa's Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled . .. The story examined Mr Ayuk's involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians. . After the story was published, the M&G's web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet's entire website for a morning in response to the complaint. . M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website. . Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\".. Last November during the UN's climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called . .. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN's flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk's US fraud conviction. . The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication.. Two weeks later, Climate Home News' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered.. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed. . Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles.. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\". Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered.. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\". . Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\". When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims. . Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication.. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.. ",
