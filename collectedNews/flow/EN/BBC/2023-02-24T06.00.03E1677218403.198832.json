        "content": "Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial. But Alex Murdaugh, 54, denied ever hurting Maggie or Paul Murdaugh, who were fatally shot at the family's secluded hunting estate in June 2021.. The former lawyer took the stand on Thursday in week five of the trial. . Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison without parole if convicted.. The trial in Walterboro has rocked the southern corner of South Carolina, where the defendant's family has dominated the legal landscape for more than a century. . Prosecutors have argued that Mr Murdaugh killed Maggie, 52, and Paul, 22, in a desperate attempt to gain sympathy and conceal a decade of financial crimes. . Mr Murdaugh, who has admitted to stealing from clients and colleagues, is facing nearly 100 separate financial charges, with prosecutors alleging he stole about $8.8m (£7.3m).. The defence team has dismissed this theory at trial, saying Mr Murdaugh would never have \"butchered\" his family. . In court on Thursday, Mr Murdaugh wept as he recalled the night he found Maggie and Paul dead.  . \"I saw what y'all have seen pictures of,\" he told jurors, referring to graphic photos of the crime scene. \"So bad.\". And he addressed perhaps the most incriminating element of the prosecution's case: that he had lied about being with Maggie and Paul at the dog kennels on the family property shortly before they were killed. . A mobile phone video taken at the kennels by Paul about five minutes before prosecutors say the killings took place, which featured both Alex Murdaugh and Maggie's voices in the background, contradicted the defendant's claims that he had been napping inside the family home. . \"Once I lied,\" he said, \"I continued to lie.\" He blamed the earlier denials on paranoia from his years-long addiction to painkillers. . That addiction also featured prominently in his testimony. Mr Murdaugh told jurors a knee injury in college led to a deep dependence on oxycodone, one that he drained his bank account to sate. . \"I'm not quite sure how I let myself get where I got,\" Mr Murdaugh said. . He also referred to one of the more bizarre elements of his saga: a hoax attempt on his life. . He called police in September 2021 - nearly three months after the murders of his wife and son - saying he had been shot in the head on the side of a rural road.. But he later admitted he had paid a distant cousin to shoot him, hoping his surviving son, Buster, could collect on his life insurance policy.. The jury also heard a recording of the 911 call Mr Murdaugh made after his wife and son were killed. In it, he is heard saying: \"I should have known.\" . Mr Murdaugh explained his statement by saying his son Paul had been the subject of death threats on social media that the family did not take seriously. . \"We disregarded it because it was so over the top,\" he said.. Through hours of questioning, Mr Murdaugh maintained a mostly contrite demeanour, even under cross-examination by lead prosecutor Creighton Waters. . An animated Mr Waters, who paced around the court during questioning, pushed Mr Murdaugh with increasing intensity on a litany of alleged financial crimes. . \"I was wrong,\" Mr Murdaugh said, over and over again. \"I remember stealing from people, I remember lying to people and I remember misleading people.\"   . But Mr Murdaugh rejected assertions by Mr Waters that he was concerned about his \"financial house of cards\" collapsing.  . \"You have charged me with the murder of my wife and son and I have sat here for all these weeks listening to all this financial stuff that I did wrong, that I'm embarrassed by,\" Mr Murdaugh said. . But he denied resorting to violence.. Cross-examination will resume tomorrow.. ",

        "content": "The New York Post reports that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his Manhattan office.. The NYPD told the BBC an unnamed 78-year-old man had been found dead on Thursday morning at 767 Fifth Avenue.. The address is where the offices of Thomas H Lee Capital LLC are listed. . According to Forbes, Mr Lee was worth $2bn (£1.6bn) at his time of death. . The police spokesman did not confirm the man had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, noting the cause of death would be for a medical examiner to determine.. In a statement to BBC News, police said they had responded to a 911 call shortly after 11:00 (16:00 GMT) on Thursday morning from inside of an office on Fifth Avenue.. \"Upon arrival EMS [Emergency Medical Services] responded and pronounced the male deceased at the scene,\" they said.. A statement by family friend and spokesman Michael Sitrick said: \"While the world knew him as one of the pioneers in the private equity business and a successful businessman, we knew him as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, sibling, friend and philanthropist who always put others' needs before his own.\". Alongside his pioneering of the leveraged buyout, Mr Lee was also known for acquiring beverage company Snapple in 1992 and selling it two years later to Quaker Oats for $1.7bn - 32 times what he bought it for.. Mr Lee was also celebrated for his philanthropy, and had served as a trustee for prominent New York City art organisations like the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Museum of Modern Art. . In 1996, he donated $22m to his alma mater Harvard University, part of which has been used to provide financial aid for students. . \"I've been lucky to make some money. I'm more than happy to give some of it back,\" he said at the time.. He is survived by his wife, Ann Tenenbaum, and his five children. . ",

        "content": "Moldova has warned for weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. And officials rejected Russia's claims as \"psy-ops\" as part of the war.. \"The defence ministry believes it is an element of a psychological operation rather than a real plan,\" said state secretary Valeriu Mija.. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. . \"Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,\" she said.. Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country's sovereignty.. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine's power grid had knock-on effects.. Rampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. . There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as \"hybrid attacks\". . A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what his predecessor called \"multiple crises\".. President Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova's leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\".. Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match.. The Kremlin accused Moldova's leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.. Political analyst Denis Cenusa said . . If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.. On Moldova's eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. Dominated by Russian speakers, it proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. . A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.. As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria.  . That has not happened, but what Moldova's leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.. A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.. Ukrainian \"infiltrators\" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria's authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.. Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.. The head of Transnistria's peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia's warnings did \"give reasons for serious concerns\".. ",
