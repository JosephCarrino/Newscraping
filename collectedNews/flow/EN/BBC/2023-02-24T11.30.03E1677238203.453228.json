        "content": "The New York Post reports that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his Manhattan office.. The NYPD told the BBC an unnamed 78-year-old man had been found dead on Thursday morning at 767 Fifth Avenue.. The address is where the offices of Thomas H Lee Capital LLC are listed. . According to Forbes, Mr Lee was worth $2bn (£1.6bn) at his time of death. . The police spokesman did not confirm the man had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, noting the cause of death would be for a medical examiner to determine.. In a statement to BBC News, police said they had responded to a 911 call shortly after 11:00 (16:00 GMT) on Thursday morning from an office on Fifth Avenue.. \"Upon arrival EMS [Emergency Medical Services] responded and pronounced the male deceased at the scene,\" they said.. A statement by family friend and spokesman Michael Sitrick said: \"While the world knew him as one of the pioneers in the private equity business and a successful businessman, we knew him as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, sibling, friend and philanthropist who always put others' needs before his own.\". Alongside his pioneering of the leveraged buyout, Mr Lee was also known for acquiring beverage company Snapple in 1992 and selling it two years later to Quaker Oats for $1.7bn - 32 times what he bought it for.. Mr Lee was also celebrated for his philanthropy, and had served as a trustee for prominent New York City art organisations like the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Museum of Modern Art. . In 1996, he donated $22m to his alma mater Harvard University, part of which has been used to provide financial aid for students. . \"I've been lucky to make some money. I'm more than happy to give some of it back,\" he said at the time.. He is survived by his wife, Ann Tenenbaum, and his five children. . ",

Temperatures in Washington DC hit 81F (27C) on Thursday, a February-high not seen since 1874. . The North Carolina cities of Charlotte and Greensboro also experienced record highs.. The hot winter weather is in stark contrast to the cold snap hitting southern California, which is usually warm and sunny year-round. . There, a winter storm warning was issued for millions who were told to brace for unusually cold temperatures, blistery winds and snow. . \"We are still on track for our DANGEROUS winter storm. Expect blizzard conditions in the mountains with FEET of snowfall\", National Weather Service (NWS) Los Angeles wrote in a tweet. . According to the NWS, the last time that Los Angeles was under a blizzard warning was in 1989.. Elsewhere, the cold snap forced schools, businesses and some state legislatures to close. . Portland, Oregon, had nearly 11in (28cm) of snowfall overnight, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported, its second snowiest day ever recorded.. Slushy, snowy streets caused major traffic delays for commuters after forecasters there only predicted a light dusting of snow.. Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesman Dylan Rivera told local media that forecasters had failed to predict the \"epic\" snowfall. . \"Even if we had a warning, this would have been an epic event. And now, an epic event with no warning? That's a double whammy,\" he told Oregon Public Broadcasting.. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called in the National Guard to help motorists stranded on the wintry roads.. The storm led to the death in Michigan of a volunteer firefighter, who reportedly came into contact with a downed powerline. . Officials in Oregon are also investigating a suspected hypothermia death that they say may be related to the storm. . High winds were also an issue in parts of the US, uprooting a massive redwood tree, which then \"speared\" into the living room of a home in California's Bay Area, local media reported. Fire officials there said a one-year-old baby was in critical condition.. The Bay Area fire department said they had been flooded with calls of fallen trees, blocked homes and power lines clogging roads..

        "content": "To persuade the public, the news anchor portrayed President Putin as a sea captain steering the good ship Russia through stormy waters of global unrest.. \"Russia is an oasis of stability, a safe harbour,\" he continued. \"If it wasn't for Putin what would have become of us?\". So much for an oasis of stability and safe harbour. On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. . Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia's neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. . Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. . All problems of Titanic proportions.. So why did Russia's president set a course for war and territorial conquest? . \"On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,\" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. . \"Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?\" . Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. . The Kremlin had expected its \"special military operation\" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia's orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine's capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.. Russia's leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin's way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.. Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?. This week he gave us some clues. . His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.. The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that \"there are battles going on right now on [Russia's] historical frontiers\" and praised Russia's \"courageous warriors\".  . Conclusion: don't expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.. \"If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,\" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin's former economic adviser. \"There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.\". But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible?  . \"It's possible to sit down with anyone,\" Andrei Illarionov continues, \"but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. . \"Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.\". When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow's assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. . And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine's stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: \"Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own security…\"  He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.. Putin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the \"collective West\", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia's enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.. But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia's economy even more. . As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia's Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. . Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. . \"Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,\" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there's a chance to redistribute wealth.\". \"The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.\". \"Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?\" I ask Konstantin.. \"Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.\". \"And does Putin know these discussions are happening?\". \"He knows. I think he knows everything.\". This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament declared: \"As long as there's Putin, there's Russia.\" . It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin's fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine. . ",
