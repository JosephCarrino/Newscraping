        "content": "At the time of the attacks in 2001, the Taliban had allowed al-Qaeda militants to operate from Afghanistan.. The suicide plane attacks on America claimed 2,977 lives.. Judge George Daniels said he was \"constitutionally restrained\" from approving access to the funds, which are frozen in the US, as this would amount to a ruling that the Taliban were Afghanistan's legitimate government. . He noted that the Biden administration did not recognise the Taliban, which meant US courts did not have the power to do so either.. \"The judgment creditors are entitled to collect on their default judgments and be made whole for the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history, but they cannot do so with the funds of the central bank of Afghanistan,\" Judge Daniels wrote in his 30-page judgement.. \"The Taliban, not the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or the Afghan people, must pay for the Taliban's liability in the 9/11 attacks,\" he added.. The Taliban were removed from power by a US-led military coalition in 2001, but retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 after Western forces withdrew from the country.. Al-Qaeda, an Islamist extremist network, planned the 11 September attacks from Afghanistan before planes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in northern Virginia, with a fourth jet crashing into a field in Pennsylvania.. The judge's ruling is a defeat for those who had claimed some of the $7bn of Afghanistan's central bank funds frozen at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.. \"This decision deprives over 10,000 members of the 9/11 community of their right to collect compensation from the Taliban,\" said Lee Wolosky, a lawyer who argued for victims' compensation. \"We believe it is wrongly decided and will appeal.\".

        "content": "Putin won't surrender easily, says US diplomat John Sullivan. John Sullivan was America's man in Moscow in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. . The former US ambassador is the one who had conversations with Russian officials about trying to prevent a war, but \"there was no engagement\", he said. . \"They demanded security guarantees for Russia but wouldn't talk constructively about security for Ukraine. They never moved beyond their talking pointsâ€¦ it was a charade.\" . When I ask whether the US should work harder at continuing those conversations to try to end the conflict, he tells me that President Vladimir Putin \"wasn't interested in negotiating before the war. He's still not interested in negotiating\". . Instead, the Biden administration has focused on rallying global support for arming Ukraine and sanctioning Russia, itself shipping billions of dollars of weapons to the country. . In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Putin repeated his view that the West had started the war, that it was using Ukraine to try to inflict a \"strategic defeat\" on Moscow, and that Russia, not Ukraine, was fighting for its very existence. . Despite the failures of Moscow's self-declared special military operation, Mr Sullivan says the goals initially declared by the Kremlin remain the same - to \"de-Nazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine. He interprets that as \"removing the government in Kyiv and subjugating the Ukrainian people\".. This is part of a vision that President Putin has outlined to re-gather the Russian peoples that were separated by the collapse of the Soviet Union. . \"He can't have a democratically elected government, particularly one led by President [Volodymyr] Zelensky, in Kyiv,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He will never be satisfied as long as that government exists because he considers it a threat to Russia and to his vision of this larger Russian state he's trying to create.\"  . So what, then, would it take for Mr Putin to stop the war? . \"He has to be convinced that he can't win,\" says Mr Sullivan. \"He's going to double down until he's convinced that there's just no way he can win. I'm not sure how significant the battlefield setbacks have to be for him to reach that point, but he's nowhere near that today.\" . This video can not be played. Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. Mr Sullivan says the Russian leader has a long-time horizon, and \"a vision for what he wants to accomplish that he will not surrender easily\". . Neither, though, will the Ukrainians, Mr Sullivan believes, declaring one of the strategic failures of Mr Putin's war to be alienating the Slavic nation of 44 million people.. \"The Ukrainian people aren't going to forgive and forget,\" he says. \"Even if President Zelenksy wanted to end the war, wanted to make territorial concessions, basically wanted to surrender, the Ukrainian people wouldn't let him.\" . With such a military, political and ideological standoff, the US has to be prepared for a long war. . President Joe Biden underlined America's commitment by making a surprise visit to Kyiv on the anniversary of the invasion, but Mr Sullivan does not expect the conflict to end this year. . \"Beyond that I don't know,\" he says. \"But [Mr Putin] doesn't want an off-ramp. The goals of this special military operation will be achieved. He says that all the time.\" . ",

        "content": "Schools have been shut and traffic has been suspended.. Earlier, Freddy caused some damage in Mauritius, flooding beachside hotels.. The Indian Ocean island nation is particularly vulnerable to cyclones. It is hit by an average of 1.5 cyclones every year, the highest rate in Africa, according to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.. The cyclone slightly weakened once it made landfall on Madagascar, situated off the south-east coast of Africa, with wind gusts exceeding 130km/h (81mph). The country's meteorological service warned that torrential rains would continue along its path. . \"The sea remains very rough... and a significant risk of coastal flooding will continue overnight,\" it said. . A 27-year-old man drowned near the port of Mahanoro before the storm made landfall, officials said. . Officials also said 7,000 people had been pre-emptively evacuated from the coastal region directly in Freddy's path, and warnings waves could reach over 8m (26ft) were issued by the International Federation of Red Cross. . Some people used sandbags to weigh down their roofs as a precaution. . \"All the doors and windows started shaking,\" said Tahina, a resident of Mananjary, a coastal town of around 25,000 people 30km from where the cyclone first made landfall.. She had fled her home with her parents and three children to shelter in her husband's office.. \"Next to us, at least five houses have lost their roofs,\" Tahina told AFP news agency.. Pascal Salle sobbed as he surveyed the damage caused by Freddy - which had ripped a window off of his home and turned his garden into a \"sandy field\".. \"It's a repeat performance. I can't take this every year, it's not possible. Batsirai and Emnati in 2022, Freddy in 2023... Who's to say that in 15 days another one won't fall on us?\" he said.. Last month the powerful storm Cheneso smashed into north-eastern Madagascar bringing in heavy winds and triggering downpours that caused extensive flooding, and killing at least 33 people and forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.. Mananjary is still recovering from devastation caused by last year's Cyclone Batsirai, which killed more than 130 people across Madagascar.. Cyclone Freddy is forecast to cross the ocean from Madagascar and make landfall in Mozambique, before potentially moving further inland to hit Zimbabwe, UN officials say. . ",

        "content": " and sanctions have worsened the situation in recent years.. Top officials are expected to meet at the end of February to discuss a \"fundamental change\" to agriculture policy, state media has said.. This is a \"very important and urgent task\" amid \"pressing\" farming issues, news aggregator KCNA Watch reported.. The news comes as Pyongyang continues . . . South Korea's unification ministry has reportedly also sounded the alarm on the food shortages and asked the World Food Programme (WFP) for help.. Satellite imagery from South Korean authorities shows that the North produced 180,000 tonnes less food in 2022 than in 2021.. In June, the WFP raised concerns that extreme weather conditions like drought and flooding could reduce production of both winter and spring crops. State media also reported late last year that the country was experiencing its \"second worst\" drought on record. . As forecasted, food prices have risen this year amid poor harvests and people have been turning to inexpensive alternatives, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, who works with North Korea-centred publication 38North.org. . The price of corn has risen 20% at the start of 2023, with growing demand for the less preferred - compared to rice - but more affordable staple, reported Rimjin-gang, a North Korean magazine based in Japan. . \"If people are buying more corn it means food overall is getting more expensive, and staple foods like rice in particular,\" Mr Silberstein said. A kilogram of the crop now costs about 3,400 North Korean won (Â£3.10; $3.80). . North Korea is ranked one of the poorest countries in the world. Recent estimates are scarce, but CIA World Factbook estimates its gross domestic product per capita to be around $1,700 in 2015.. That said, the actual situation and numbers are unclear, given North Korea's opaque economy.. \"Due to North Korea's strict Covid border measures on goods and people, there's no way for any outsiders to go into the country and check for themselves what the situation is,\" said James Fretwell, an analyst at NK News.. These measures have also made it difficult for organisations outside North Korea to send help in times of crisis, he added.. North Korea has also strictly restricted cross-border trade and traffic since January 2020. . Sokeel Park, South Korea country director in non-profit Liberty in North Korea (Link), described the regime's response to the pandemic as \"extreme and paranoid\".. Mr Park, whose organisation helps resettle North Korean refugees in South Korea or the US, said the supply of basic necessities in the North has been dwindling since the start of the pandemic. Link has heard multiple credible reports of people starving to death, Mr Park said.. The country has also seen a significant decline in humanitarian aid from the international community - the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said North Korea received $2.3m (Â£1.9m) from international organisations and other agencies last year, down from $14m in 2021.. While this may be a result of prolonged border closures, some relief workers told the BBC that international sanctions, which have tightened in response to North Korea's military provocations, have also hindered the delivery of humanitarian supplies.. Still, there are some signs that cross-border economic activity is starting again. Nikkei Asia reported last week that some truck travel with China, which accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade, has resumed.. But that does not necessarily mean standards of living will improve for ordinary North Koreans.. Mr Park said the regime has focused its resources on its missile prowess and propaganda, at high social costs. Pyongyang fired a record number of ballistic missiles last year - more than 70, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, which can potentially reach the US mainland. Early this month, . .. \".  for ordinary North Korean people, but continues to prioritise propaganda and pageantry for the Kim family, missile launches, and strict controls [on] the population,\" Mr Park added.. Experts worry that the situation on the ground will deteriorate further, leading to a famine as devastating as the one the country experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s, often known in official documents as the \"Arduous March\". Estimates put the number of deaths between 600,000 to a million.. \"We don't seem to be near the levels of the 1990s famine,\" Mr Silberstein said. \"But margins are razor thin. So even a slightly lessened supply of food could potentially have dire consequences.\" . ",
