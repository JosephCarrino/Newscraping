        "content": "Pervez Musharraf: Pakistan's coup leader who died in exile. The former leader - who was president between 2001 and 2008 - died in Dubai after a long illness, a statement from the country's army said.. He had survived numerous assassination attempts, and found himself on the front line of the struggle between militant Islamists and the West.. He supported the US \"war on terror\" after 9/11 despite domestic opposition.. In 2008 he suffered defeat in the polls and left the country six months later. . When he returned in 2013 to try to contest the election, he was arrested and barred from standing. He was charged with high treason and was sentenced to death in absentia only for the decision to be overturned less than a month later.. He left Pakistan for Dubai in 2016 to seek medical treatment and had been living in exile in the country ever since.. Musharraf died in hospital on Sunday morning. His body will be flown back from the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan on a special flight after his family submitted an application to do so, local TV channel Geo News reports. . In the statement Pakistan's military expressed its \"heartfelt condolences\" and added: \"May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family.\". Pakistan's President Arif Alvi prayed \"for eternal rest of the departed soul and courage to the bereaved family to bear this loss.\". Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed his condolences, as did the country's military leaders.. Musharraf's rule was characterised by extremes. He was credited by some with turning around the economic fortunes of the country while leader. . He was embroiled in a number of court cases following his loss of power, including accusations of failing to provide adequate security for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose assassination by the Taliban in 2007 shocked Pakistan and the world.. And his career ultimately ended in disgrace and arrest, when he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason in 2019. Though that sentencing was later reversed, he never returned to Pakistan.. Despite these events, Fawad Chaudhury, a former aide of Musharraf and currently a senior leader of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, praised Musharraf and the influence he had on Pakistan.. \"He is called a military dictator, but there has never been a stronger democratic system than that under him... Pervez Musharraf led Pakistan at a very difficult time, and Pakistanis believe the era of his reign was one of the best in Pakistan's history,\" Mr Chaudhury said in comments cited by Reuters. . However, the CEO of Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab, Mosharraf Zaidi, said Musharraf was responsible for the \"destruction of Pakistan\" during his rule. . His time in power also divided opinion in India. . Musharraf's involvement while serving as the leader of the country's army in the Kargil conflict in May 1999 - when Pakistani generals secretly ordered an operation to occupy heights in Kargil on the Indian side - caused many in India to view him as an adversary.. But in one Indian politician's eyes, Musharraf redeemed himself during his presidency. \"Once an implacable foe of India, he became a real force for peace 2002-2007,\" Shashi Tharoor, a former UN diplomat, said. . Mr Tharoor said he met Musharraf annually in those years at the UN, and described him as \"smart, engaging and clear in his strategic thinking\".. ",

        "content": "The UK's defence ministry said Ukrainian soldiers are becoming isolated in embattled Bakhmut.. The head of Russia's notorious Wagner group said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the town.. Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago.. Taking the area is important to Russia in furthering its aim of controlling the whole of the Donbas region in the country's east. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months.. Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat.. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: \"During the 346 days of this war, I often had to say that the situation at the front was tough. And that the situation is getting tougher.. \"Now is that time again. A time when the occupier throws more and more of its forces to break our defences.\". The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town.. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire.. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area.. The head of the force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, confirmed that there are \"fierce battles for every street, every house, every stairwell\" in northern parts of Bakhmut.. Responding to reports that Ukrainian forces had retreated from the town, he said this is not the case and Ukrainian soldiers are \"fighting to the last\".. The battles on the front line come as more missiles hit parts of eastern Ukraine.. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, five people were wounded after strikes hit civilian buildings in the city, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration Oleg Sinegubov said.. Five others were injured in the Donetsk region during rocket attacks, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk's regional administration said.. Four others were killed in the Donetsk region a day earlier, he said.. This video can not be played. Watch: Mum turns TV up to hide shelling from daughter. ",

        "content": "And he pleaded with the country's leaders to focus on ending conflict.. Before leaving, he told the crowd: \"Dear brothers and sisters, I return to Rome with you even closer to my heart.\". Excited Catholics, some who camped overnight for the Mass, told Reuters it was a joyful moment.. \"To this moment I do not sleep, I was very excited,\" Jovana Buyom said.. \"We are really very happy with the coming of Pope because he will give us the message of peace, we can unite as South Sudanese people,\" Juaj Bol Ayuel said.. The Mass, which took place at the John Garang Mausoleum in front of an audience of 70,000 according to estimates, was filled with cheerful worshippers waiving flags and deep in prayer. . The religious ceremony fell on the last day of the Pope's visit to South Sudan, which was his first to the country.. Since it got independence in 2011, the country has been wracked by civil war after the president fell out with his then vice president in 2013.. Despite a peace deal in 2018, violence driven by ethnic tensions has continued - more than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict.. At least 20 people were killed in a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit.. The Pope, who visited the country alongside other Christian leaders - the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rev Iain Greenshields - has been on a peace mission and pleaded with South Sudanese clergy to raise their voices against injustice on Saturday.. He also told them that they cannot remain neutral against injustice: \"If we want to be pastors who intercede, we cannot remain neutral before the pain caused by acts of injustice and violence. To violate the fundamental rights of any woman or man is an offence against Christ.\". The Pope had a similar message of peace and reconciliation when he visited the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this week.. This video can not be played. Why is Pope Francis in South Sudan?. ",
