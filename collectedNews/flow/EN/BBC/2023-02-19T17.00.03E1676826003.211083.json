        "content": "This escalation would mean \"serious consequences\" for China, he warned.. China has denied reports that Moscow has requested military equipment.. Chinese President Xi Jinping is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is yet to condemn Russia's invasion - but he has sought to remain neutral in the conflict and has called for peace.. Mr Blinken was speaking to CBS after he met China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.. He said that during the meeting he expressed \"deep concerns\"  about the \"possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia\".. \"To date, we have seen Chinese companies... provide non-lethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they're considering providing lethal support,\" he said. . He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China's potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.. The .  to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. . Mr Blinken told CBS that \"of course, in China, there's really no distinction between private companies and the state\".. If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a \"serious problem for us and in our relationship\", he added.. Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.. But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.. Mr Blinken's warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.. Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economy. China's trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.. Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.. \"We've been very clear that we shouldn't fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,\" he said. . He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia \"in the months ahead\". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.. Mr Wang said in Munich yesterday that China had \"neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire\" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.. China would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.. \"I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,\" Mr Wang said.. He added that there were \"some forces that seemingly don't want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon\", but did not say who he meant. . The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a \"peace speech\" on the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tajani.. Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi's speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.. During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening .  that was shot down over the US. . Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not \"stand for any violation of our sovereignty\" and said \"this irresponsible act must never again occur\". . Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China's \"surveillance balloon program\" across five continents.. Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a \"political farce manufactured by the US\" and accused them of \"using all means to block and suppress China\". China has denied sending a spy balloon.. And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would \"bear all the consequences\" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would \"follow through to the end\" in the event \"the US insists on taking advantage of the issue\", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.. The .  - the BBC's US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.. ",

Israel frequently attacks targets in Syria linked to Iran and Hezbollah militants but rarely acknowledges its actions. However, attacks on residential areas are rare. . Sunday's attack was the first since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the north-west of the country, as well as parts of neighbouring Turkey, 12 days ago.. The Kafr Sousa area is home to senior officials and security agencies, but also civilians living in residential buildings..

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 15 people, including civilians.. \"The strike on Sunday is the deadliest Israeli attack in the Syrian capital,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the observatory.. It comes over a month after an Israeli strike hit Damascus's international airport, according to the Syrian army, killing four people including two soldiers.. Israel has previously acknowledged that it targets the bases of militant groups loyal to Iran. . The two countries are arch-foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a \"shadow war\" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals.. ",

        "content": "Art lovers in Miami looked on in horror on Thursday night, when a collector accidentally knocked a $42,000 (Â£34,870) sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons to the ground.. She had tapped it with her finger, witnesses at the event said.. The statue - one of Koons' iconic Dog Balloons - smashed into tiny shards, and had to be swept into dustpans by gallery staff.. The accident happened during the exclusive VIP-only opening night of Art Wynwood, a contemporary art fair held annually in Miami, Florida.. Local artist Stephen Gamson told the Miami Herald he was admiring the sculpture, when an \"older woman\" tapped it, knocking it off its pedestal.. At first he wondered if it was part of a performance piece (Banksy, anyone?) but quickly realised it had been an accident.. \"When this thing fell to the ground, it was like how a car accident draws a huge crowd on the highway,\" Mr Gamson told the paper.. Luckily for the woman, the piece is covered by insurance, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Caluch, an art advisor with Bel-Air Fine Art galleries which represents the sculpture, said.. \"It was an event!\" Ms Caluch told the Miami Herald. \"Everybody came to see what happened.\". She added that the woman who caused the damage, who has remained unnamed, was an art collector.. \"Life just stopped for 15 minutes with everyone around,\" CÃ©dric Boero, who also works for Bel-Air Fine Art galleries, told the New York Times.. He added that a colleague spoke to the woman, who said she was \"very very sorry\" and \"just wanted to disappear\".. The sculpture was part of a limited edition which has now shrunk from 799 to 798.. \"That's a good thing for the collectors,\" Mr Boero told the Times, laughing.. Despite being shattered into thousands of pieces, there is still interest in buying the destroyed sculpture.. Mr Gamson offered to buy it there and then because, as he said . , \"it has a really cool story\".. Jeff Koons, 68, has not made any comment on the incident.. His range of Balloon Dog sculptures are among the most iconic works of contemporary art, and have sold for tens of millions of dollars.. Some are enormous - as high as 10ft (3m) - but this ill fated one was just a puppy, at 16 inches (40cm) tall.. They have graced galleries around the world, and were further iconised by Jay-Z in 2017 when the rapper worked directly with Koons to create a 40-foot inflatable Balloon Dog for a stage prop.. In 2019 Koons made history when his Rabbit sculpture sold at auction for $91.1m (Â£71m) - . . . ",

        "content": "You see a cut on her heel. Her eyes are bloodshot and her face red, but her voice is clear as she gives the person on the other end of the phone line directions to the apartment. In front of her, an open and packed suitcase lies on the floor.. We are watching a video filmed on a phone from the night of 29 March 2022. The man filming the video raises his voice to say: \"It's bullshit! Nothing's happened to her!\". The man is Simon Leviev, the convicted con artist and subject of the Netflix documentary, The Tinder Swindler. The woman is 23-year-old Israeli model Kate Konlin, who was then his girlfriend.. Leviev sent the video to the BBC with other videos and documents about their relationship. . \"She lies and she lies,\" he wrote.. \"Of course he'd call me a liar,\" Kate Konlin tells the BBC. . \"He's called every woman who has spoken out against him a liar. He doesn't want me to tell my story of emotional abuse.\". In the beginning, Ms Konlin's friends adored Leviev. . \"Kate, he's too perfect,\" she recalls them gushing, \"it's even a little scary.\". Shimon Heyada Hayut (who legally changed his name to Simon Leviev), slipped into her Instagram DMs in 2020, and within weeks they were together.. \"At first, our relationship was a love bomb,\" Ms Konlin tells the BBC. \"He was obsessed with me.\". Leviev accompanied her to modelling shoots and waited while she worked. He cleaned her home and sent her long and loving voicenotes. . It was intense but as a 23-year-old, it was what she thought love should be, she says. . But after a while, the fights started.. This video can not be played. Kate Konlin: 'This is not the classic Tinder Swindler story about losing money'. Ms Konlin says that when he criticised her appearance, clothes, her weight and her skin (she experiences bouts of acne), she began to lose confidence. She wasn't sure what he would say next. . \"I felt I was walking on eggshells,\" she says.. She saw her friends less and less during the 18 months they were together, and when she did they said she was no longer the lively, colourful and sociable person they had once known.. \"They said I was 'grey',\" she says, looking down at her hands.. After a few months, Leviev began to ask for money, borrowing thousands of dollars at a time, up to a total, Ms Konlin says, of $150,000. She was already an international model who had been on the cover of Vogue Japan, Grazia Italy and Wallpaper magazine in the UK. She was financially secure and she says he knew it. . Ms Konlin has sent the BBC more than a dozen of Leviev's voicenotes. He often shouts, and asks for loans saying that his own money is tied up in investments.. In one, he shouts as he explains why he cannot pay her back: \"Kate, I'm a millionaire! And that's a fact. At the moment, I'm stuck. Understand? I'm stuck! Do you understand that in your screwed-up brain? That bird brain of yours. I'm stuck, Kate. I didn't steal from you. You gave it to me of your own free will. You lent it to me. I'm stuck, that's all.\". The Tinder Swindler, which became Netflix's most-watched documentary in 90 countries when it was released in February 2022, alleged that Simon Leviev had conned women he met on the Tinder dating app out of about $10m. He denies the allegations.. Ms Konlin says she watched it while sitting next to him on the sofa.. \"I knew it was all true,\" she says.. But she says she felt obliged to accept his version of events. According to her, it was a controlling relationship, and it was easy for him to persuade her to defend him publicly, for example on US news show Inside Edition.. \"He told me, 'If you stick up for me, people will believe me, because you are a woman.'\" . At the same time, her Instagram inbox filled with abuse sent by people who had seen shots of her at the end of the Tinder Swindler. . \"People told me they wished that I would get cancer or be run over by a car, and that I deserved the worst of everything because I was in a relationship with him,\" Ms Konlin says.. The arguments between the couple intensified and on 29 March everything came to a head. . \"I said, 'That's it, I'm leaving. I can't take it any more.' I started packing my stuff,\" she says. . Ms Konlin says the argument turned physical. She says he pushed her and she cut her foot on a step with a rough edge.. \"I was bleeding. I felt dead. I wanted to kill myself,\" she says.. This brought the fight to a halt. It was then that Leviev filmed Ms Konlin as she called an ambulance, and shouted out that nothing had happened to her.. After going to hospital, she filed a complaint against Leviev with the police.. When we asked Leviev to respond, he sent us nine emails within 45 minutes, and two more direct messages on the video-sharing app, Cameo, in the days that followed. . There were many screenshots of WhatsApp messages and a video which shows Ms Konlin shouting and grabbing him.. Leviev says he has never physically harmed any woman.. Janey Starling, a campaigner against domestic abuse, says the picture Ms Konlin paints of her relationship with Leviev follows a familiar pattern.. \"Coercive control is something that happens on a daily basis and is very mundane. It's very small. It flies under the radar,\" she says.. \"A lot of abusive men have never been physically violent to their partnersâ¦ but they have been intensely controlling, intensely critical, belittling, and making threats.. \"It's a bit of a red herring to look for physical violence as the ultimate determination of whether an abusive relationship is abusive.\". We put to Leviev several allegations Ms Konlin made about his behaviour, including that he had coercively controlled her, and he said she was lying. . Despite being a convicted con artist, Leviev has thousands of followers on social media. He continues to post videos of himself driving expensive cars, and spending time with beautiful women. In some videos people ask for photographs with him, as if he were a celebrity. He charges Â£82 ($100) for a personalised video message and Â£165 for a call. . His popularity concerns the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).. \"We are seeing a glamorisation of a hyper-masculine anti-woman mindset and lifestyle, and it is being peddled to the most acceptable, most impressionable people, especially young men in their pre-teen years,\" says Jessica Reaves, editorial director of the ADL's Center on Extremism.. \"It's incredibly dangerous because what you're saying is, 'You can have this lifestyle too and also, by the way, part and parcel of this is dehumanising, or generally hating women'.\". We asked Leviev if he accepted this description of his posts on social media and he didn't respond.. Today, Ms Konlin laughs that she is perhaps one of the only models in the world who is happy to have gained weight - she says she was underweight from stress during her time with Leviev. . After almost a year without offers of work following the release of The Tinder Swindler, her modelling career has taken off again. She now wants to tell young women what an unhappy and controlling relationship can look like from the inside. . \"If a woman who is in the same situation sees what I experienced and how I got out, and that today I am stronger and more beautiful than when I was with him, she will hopefully see that she can also leave.\".
