The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, saying locals do not benefit.. It would be the first time a suicide attack by the BLA has been carried out by a female militant. The group has targeted Chinese nationals on a number of occasions, as has the Pakistani Taliban. . China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in resource-rich Balochistan province.. China's embassy in Pakistan confirmed that three of the country's citizens had been killed in Tuesday's blast. Pakistan's government condemned what it called a \"cowardly terrorist attack\".. The dead included the director of the Confucius Institute, a Chinese government-run body which offers language and cultural programmes overseas, and two other faculty members in Karachi.. CCTV footage showed a woman standing outside the gate of the institute as the van arrives, followed by a powerful explosion.. The BLA released a photo of a woman in fatigues raising two fingers in salute who it said had carried out the attack, and named her as Shariah Baloch alias Bramsh. . Local media reported that the bomber had been a student at the university.. Balochistan, rich in natural resources but Pakistan's poorest province, is home to a long-running insurgency.. It is being transformed by major Chinese infrastructure projects on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries which forms part of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road initiative..

        "content": "Gazprom has justified the suspension under new rules announced last month, . . . PGNiG has refused to do this. . PGNiG relies on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from the Russian company in the first quarter of this year.. It described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas. . Following the news, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. . Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. . PGNiG said its underground gas storage is almost 80% full and with summer approaching demand is lower.. Poland also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas terminal (LNG) in Swinoujscie. . And on 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal.. It can also buy gas on the European spot market and get it delivered through pipelines to Germany and the Czech Republic. . However, if Russian gas supplies remain suspended for several weeks, the country will probably have to start restricting supply to the country's largest consumers, such as chemical manufacturers, the BBC's Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton said. . Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. . And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the \"Baltic Pipe\", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries.. Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. . However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. . The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports.. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds..

        "content": "No one knows exactly what the billionaire entrepreneur has planned, with even Twitter boss Parag Agrawal acknowledging the future of the platform is uncertain. But the world's richest man has given some clues. . Mr Musk has long been vocal in his criticism of the platform's content policies, and there is speculation he could tweak Twitter's moderation rules and allow suspended accounts to return - such as that of former US President Donald Trump.. As his takeover was approved by Twitter's board, the billionaire said that free speech was the \"bedrock\" of a functioning democracy and hailed the platform as the \"digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated\".. Mr Musk has previously described himself as a \"free speech absolutist\", but his exact view of the concept is unclear. . He has also blocked people on the platform who have criticised him or his companies in the past.. If the billionaire does loosen Twitter's content moderation rules he could be in for a \"rude awakening\", says Jeffrey Howard, associate professor at University College London.. Twitter could be \"easily weaponised\" by criminals, bots and people using it for \"malicious purposes\" and to \"incite hate and violence\", Mr Howard warns.. \"I think Elon Musk is relatively na√Øve on the actual challenges involved in content moderation. He will learn as a result of this you cannot simply have a laissez-faire approach to content management.\". The UK government and European Commission have both reminded Mr Musk of his duty to protect the rights of Twitter users. And with tough new regulation to tackle online abuse on the horizon, such as the UK's government's Online Harms Bill, it is unclear what changes Mr Musk will be able to make. . Already news of the takeover has split political opinion in the US. . People on the right who feel unfairly targeted by social media platforms have welcomed the deal, while those on the left have been more critical, with Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren calling it \"dangerous for our democracy\".. Peter Vidlicka, media expert and co-founder of the public relations website Newspage, said that while Mr Musk could help Twitter \"get its mojo back\", \"in the current socio-cultural climate, we can expect fireworks in the months ahead\".. After becoming Twitter's largest shareholder earlier in April, Mr Musk posted in a series of now-deleted tweets that he'd like to get rid of adverts on Twitter's premium subscription service Twitter Blue.. \"The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive,\" Mr Musk wrote.. Although the entrepreneur might have cited concerns about advertisers' influence over Twitter policy, the platform currently relies on adverts for about 90% of its income. . In results for the three months to the end of December, Twitter said its revenue reached $1.57bn, with adverts making up $1.41bn - both up 22% year-on-year.. Mr Musk suggested improvements could be made to Twitter Blue, which could be relied on as an alternative source of income. He has also stated he wants to reduce its cost.. The service, which launched last year and is available in the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, gives users access to extra features like an \"undo tweet\" button. . But analyst Rachel Foster-Jones at GlobalData says that Elon Musk might need to \"balance his dreams of a free debate space unfettered by advertising with the harsh realities of Twitter's core business model\".. \"Musk will need to seriously revamp Twitter's subscription model, Twitter Blue, if he wants to pivot away from advertising,\" she adds. . Mr Musk has spoken of \"defeating the spam bots\", one pledge that is likely to be extremely popular with Twitter users.. Twitter has long had an issue with automated, fake accounts being used to relentlessly post unhelpful or misleading content.. Jamie Moles, senior sales engineer at cybersecurity firm ExtraHop, says that while removing the Twitter bots seems like a huge task, if Mr Musk is successful \"the methods used by Twitter to eliminate bots from the platform may generate new techniques that improve the detection and identification of spam emails, spam posts and other malicious intrusion attempts\" more widely.. However, Robin Mansell, professor of new media and the internet at the London School of Economics, says there will \"always be errors\" in the authentication of users by humans or algorithms. . \"Anyone who offers certainty in this space is full of hype or wishful thinking,\" Prof Mansell says. . \"When Musk gets immersed in the business he'll realise there are more constraints and governance arrangements to which these companies have to pay respect when they operate internationally.\". Before his bid for Twitter, Mr Musk asked his 83.6m followers if they wanted an edit button in a Twitter poll.. It led to Twitter confirming that it was already working on a such a feature, which would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted.. Users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns about how to execute it. On the plus side, it would allow users to fix typos or errors in a tweet without losing any replies, retweets or likes it has already gained.. But if it isn't handled well, it could affect the platform's transparency, warned Jay Sullivan, the company's vice president of consumer product, last month, . Mr Sullivan has said \"without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited\" such a feature \"could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation\"..

        "content": "The increase in prices \"is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects\", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC.. He said \"households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis\". . \"We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,\" the senior economist at the World Bank added. . Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. . The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year.. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen \"the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike\", when .  sent prices soaring.. Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. . Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said \"disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect\" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. . Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving to . . That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere.. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at their .  60 years ago.. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically.. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. . Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall.. \"Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,\" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season.. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, \"equate to about 10 days of world food supply\". . This video can not be played. The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. . As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: \"We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years\".. Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means \"there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline\". . For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: \"While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast.\". It added that \"the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine\" and the disruption it causes to supply chains..
