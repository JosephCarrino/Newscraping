        "content": "In it, a deadline of 7 July is set for him to issue his decision.. If it goes ahead, it would be the first deep coal mine to open in the UK for more than 30 years.. In autumn, .  into whether West Cumbria Mining .  at the former Marchon chemical works site in Whitehaven, for use in steel making.. The coal would not be used for power generation.. Supporters claim it will create jobs and reduce the need to import coal. . However, opponents say it will damage the UK's commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions.. The proposed mine would remove coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea for the production of steel in the UK and Europe.. Copeland mayor Mike Starkie, who has previously said local support for a new mine is strong, said the process had \"dragged on for over six years\".. He said: \"Now the planning inspector has completed his report which I hope - and expect - is a recommendation that the approval is granted immediately with no further unnecessary delay.. \"I would urge the secretary of state to approve the mine immediately - there is a clear demand for coking coal and approval will give a huge economic boost to west Cumbria.. \"It also supports both the government's levelling-up agenda and the need to become more self-reliant. There is no need to delay approval for this mine a minute longer.\". Governing is about difficult choices; confronting seemingly irreconcilable demands - and making a decision.  . So, should the government say yes to a new coal mine in Cumbria, providing a domestic source of coking coal for the steel industry?  . Around 40% of the UK's coking coal is currently imported from Russia.  . Or do promises to drive down carbon emissions make opening a new mine look ridiculous?  . There's been disagreement and dither. Plenty of both. But now, for the first time, the government faces a deadline, the 7th July. By then it has to decide what to do. . Planning inspector Stephen Normington previously said he would make his recommendation in late December or early January.. The mine was approved to operate until 2049 by Cumbria County Council in October 2020, but . .. West Cumbria Mining previously said exploratory works led it to estimate there were about 750m tonnes of \"excellent quality\" coking coal in the area.. However, the company would be limited by planning conditions to produce no more than 2.78m tonnes a year.. What did Putin do before he came to power?.

        "subtitle": "Drivers say deliveries of produce like meat are losing quality and value in long waits at the port.",
        "content": "The queues eased on Sunday, but the British Meat Processors Association said some of its members had waited for 24 hours or more to cross.. The government said traffic management measures were under regular review.. However, a Department for Transport spokesperson gave no indication that there would be a change made for those transporting perishable items. . As well as the other factors causing congestion, which have led to the traffic management system Operation Brock being put in place, there have also been problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit.. Lockerbie-based Eardley International takes fresh meat from the UK into continental Europe, operating 25 trucks at any one time.. \"Our products have a very short shelf life,\" company director Graham Eardley told the BBC.. \"If we load lamb in the UK on a Monday, we'd expect to deliver that product to Germany on a Tuesday. Now we are seeing delays of 20 to 25 hours to cross the Channel, and the quality and the sale value of that product falls by every hour it is delayed.\". Furthermore, haulier regulations mean drivers need to take an 11-hour break when they get to Calais, as they cannot rest while they are in the traffic jam in case they need to move their vehicle. This just adds to the problem. . P&O routes are still being suspended due to a shortage of ferry services following its . . . on the Dover-Calais route next week if it gets regulatory approval. . Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the delays meant that the UK was losing business, as customers were turning to other countries to source goods at a time when their members' products were in hot demand. . \"We are told to expect disruption well into next week. With Easter weekend approaching and a very busy time for exporting fresh meat, this is really bad timing.\". For Mr Eardley, the delays mean losing up to Â£800 per truck. . He says the abattoirs who use his services are also getting claims for late delivery and loss in value.. \"We are paying for the driver to be sitting in the truck not being productive and seeing the loss of the revenue that the vehicle could be making.\" . Many in the industry argue that hauliers carrying fresh produce should be prioritised for boarding, . The Kent Resilience Forum, which manages emergency planning for the county, said they were waiting for the government to advise them of who and what would be allowed to jump the queue.. This is causing huge frustration to Mr Eardley, who says that as hauliers register customs forms listing the contents of their lorries, it should be a straightforward process to put in place. . Toby Howe, the tactical lead for the forum, explained: \"It is not as simple as saying we will just fast-track meat or anything perishable. . \"In 2015 we were given very general guidance and drivers got clever by putting a small amount in the lorry. For EU exit planning, Defra came up with specifics which we were then able to prioritise.\". Others believe you cannot retrofit a priority system.  . In response, the Department for Transport (DfT) said the traffic management measures were regularly reviewed but did not say whether any changes would be made with regard to the transportation of perishable items. . It said: \"P&O's unacceptable actions have resulted in its vessels being detained, causing backlogs and traffic jams which would be substantially alleviated if its fleet was operating normally. We are receiving real-time updates as the Kent Resilience Forum, police and regional leaders work around-the-clock to ease disruption and support those affected.\". Trade body Logistics UK said it supported prioritising perishable goods, but said the practicalities of facilitating such a policy were currently unclear.. Mags Simpson, Logistics UK's head of policy engagement, said: \"The delays are frustrating for industry and Logistics UK is working with DfT and the ports to identify effective solutions that can be introduced as soon as possible.\". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - the trade association that represents businesses which store and move frozen and chilled food - said the poor conditions caused by Operation Brock were fanning the flames of driver shortages, in an already overstretched industry. . \"The UK is getting a growing reputation for being a hassle to serve, and that creates problems for my members who can't find the hauliers to take their business because they don't want to take the risk of sitting in traffic on the M20.\" . Part of the frustration is that hauliers feel like tourist traffic in Dover is being prioritised over freight traffic. Mr Eardley says this further undermines morale.. \"Are we saying that it's not fair to have Jimmy and Jonny delayed in their car going on holiday, but that it's acceptable to ask drivers to wait 20 hours or more in their cab? Until there is more understanding of drivers and their experience, we are on the road to ruin.\" . From July this year, the UK will start imposing Brexit controls on meat and dairy goods coming in from the EU. Industry leaders are concerned that this will be yet another crunch time for Dover..

Senior officials in Mr Zelensky's team praised the UK for support during its conflict with Russia. . Mr Johnson's visit to Kyiv was not announced in advance and the first indication he was in the city came when a photograph of his meeting with President Zelensky was . A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\".

He reiterated that the UK and other countries supporting Ukraine would continue to tighten .  including moving away from the use of Russian hydrocarbons.. The PM added: \"Over the last few hours I've been able to see quite a lot of your beautiful country and it's an amazing country.  I've also seen the tragic effects of the war, an inexcusable war, an absolutely inexcusable and unnecessary war.\". Mr Zelensky welcomed the UK's \"decisive and significant support\" for his country and urged other Western allies to intensify the pressure on Moscow.. \"We have to exert pressure in the form of sanctions. It is time to impose a complete embargo on Russian energy resources. They should increase the amount of weapons being supplied,\" he said.. In a Facebook post, Andriy Sybiha, deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, said: \"The UK is the leader in defence support for Ukraine. The leader in the anti-war coalition. The leader in sanctions against the Russian aggressor.\". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell both made visits to Ukraine for talks with President Zelensky on Friday, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met him in Kyiv on Saturday. . But Mr Johnson is the first member of a G7 country to travel to the Ukrainian capital for talks during the conflict.. Mr Zelensky has called on the international community to hold to account Russian forces who carried out the missile strike on Kramatorsk station, which was packed with women and children trying to flee the area.. The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack.. Mr Johnson's visit to Kyiv came the day after the UK announced Â£100m of weapons for the country.. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Friday, Mr Johnson said the UK will send additional military equipment including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles..

        "content": "The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. . The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020.. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP). which measures activity in services, construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January.. \"The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified,\" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. . \"But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon.\" . Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, a business lobby group, said: \"Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since, with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth,\" he said. \"Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict, which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption.\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he \"welcomed\" February's growth figures. He said: \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion.\". The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment \"driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars\".. It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. . Barret Kupelian, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: \"This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with, because of the semiconductor shortage. . \"Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases.\". The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was, in part, \"driven by Storm Eunice, Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed\".. The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued, with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators.    . Mr Kupelian said growth momentum \"shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic, including accommodation and food services, activities and arts, entertainment, and recreation\". .

        "content": "And Mr Sunak has referred himself to the prime minister's ethics adviser over opposition claims he has not been transparent about his tax arrangements.. He says he his confident he followed all the rules - but Labour says he still has questions to answer.. Here is what we know about the Sunak family finances.. Mr Sunak was born in Southampton in 1980 to Indian parents who had emigrated from East Africa. His father was a GP and his mother ran her own pharmacy.. After being educated at a private boarding school, Winchester College - and working as a waiter at a curry house in Southampton during his summer holidays - he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University, achieving a first-class degree. He later gained an Masters of Business Administration (MBA) at Stanford University in California, where he met Ms Murty.. From 2001 to 2004, Mr Sunak was an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs, and was later a partner in two hedge funds.. In 2015, Mr Sunak entered parliament as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire and served as a junior minister in former Prime Minister Theresa May's government. . He was then made chief secretary to the Treasury by her successor, Boris Johnson, before being promoted to chancellor in February 2020.. As an MP and chancellor, Mr Sunak's government salary is Â£151,649.. But before entering politics, he was a partner at two highly-profitable hedge funds and is now thought to be one of the richest MPs. . According . , he was a \"multimillionaire in his mid-twenties\", but he has never commented publicly on how much he is worth.. He recently attracted criticism from Labour for donating more than Â£100,000 to his former school, to fund bursaries for children who could not afford to attend it.. Labour has posed a number of questions, including: Has Mr Sunak ever benefited from the use of tax havens?. , with a report claiming he was listed as a beneficiary of tax haven trusts in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands in 2020. A spokesperson for Mr Sunak said they \"did not recognise\" the claims.. Politicians with share portfolios and investments routinely set up \"blind trusts\" when they get government jobs. This allows them to continue earning income from their investments without knowing where the money is invested.. The aim is to remove potential conflicts of interest, when they are taking economic policy decisions that might make them more money - but the practice is controversial.. Mr Sunak is one of six ministers, including Zac Goldsmith, son of billionaire financier James Goldsmith, to register blind trusts in the . .. Mr Sunak set up his trust in 2019, when he was promoted to second-in-command to then chancellor Sajid Javid, in 2019. . Labour says Mr Sunak is the first chancellor to have registered a holding in an investment fund since the ministerial interests list was set up, and have questioned whether such an arrangement should be allowed. . The opposition party is calling on Mr Sunak to publish details of what is contained in the trust, and to say whether he has had an update on how well the investments are doing since he became chancellor in February 2020.. The Treasury has said Mr Sunak \"followed the ministerial code to the letter\".. Sajid Javid had wealth in an offshore trust, but disposed of it when he became a minister in 2012, paying 50% tax on the money he brought into the UK. Mr Javid has also admitted to holding non-dom status for six years, when he was a banker. . , but in 2016 .  he thought it was \"simpler and more straightforward to just sell everything\" before taking office.. The Sunaks are understood to own four properties.. A Grade II-listed manor house in the village of Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton, in his Richmond constituency, was bought for Â£1.5m in 2015. A five-bedroom townhouse in South Kensington, London, which records show was last sold for Â£4.5m in 2010..

Not long after her birth in 1980, she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents as her mother, Sudha Murty, and father, Narayana Murthy, advanced their careers in Mumbai.. A year later, Mr Murthy would co-found Infosys, an IT services company that would propel him onto India's rich-list. His daughter would build on his legacy.. Ms Murty was educated in the US, where she studied economics and French at the private liberal Claremont McKenna College in California. She then earned a diploma at a fashion college before working at Deloitte and Unilever and studying for an MBA at Stanford University..

It currently operates in around 50 countries, including the UK, where it has public sector contracts.. Headquartered in Bangalore, the company reported revenues of more than $11.8bn (Â£9bn) in 2019, $12.8bn in 2020, and $13.5bn in 2021..

His wife, Sudha, is chairperson of the Infosys Foundation, a non-profit organisation that supports charity initiatives. She is best known for her philanthropy and literature including her novel Dollar Bahu (Dollar Daughter-in-Law in English), which was adapted into a TV series.. Ms Murty's stake in Infosys became a subject of controversy over its operations in Russia following President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The firm . .. But the money she makes from her shares came back into focus when she confirmed her non-dom status.. Infosys's latest annual report shows Ms Murty owns a 0.9% stake in Infosys. Her stake fluctuates in value but is estimated to be worth about Â£700m.. Ms Murty receives annual dividend payments on the shares, which last year added up to Â£11.6m.
