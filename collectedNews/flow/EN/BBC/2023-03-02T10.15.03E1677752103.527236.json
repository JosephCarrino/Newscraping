        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. Rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Protests were also held in Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa, near where the disaster happened on Tuesday night.. The government has said an independent investigation will deliver justice.. Three days of national mourning have been declared across the country following the incident, in which a passenger service crashed head on into a freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames. . The front carriages of the passenger train were mostly destroyed.. Many of the 350 passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said \"tragic human error\" was to blame for the disaster.. A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence. He has denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on a technical fault.. Rail union members believe safety systems were not working properly, with repeated warnings about this over many years.. In protest and mourning, rail workers are planning on striking on Thursday at what they say is official neglect of the railways.. \"Pain has turned into anger for the dozens of dead and wounded colleagues and fellow citizens,\" the workers' union said in a statement announcing the strike.. \"The disrespect shown over the years by governments to the Greek railways led to the tragic result,\" it added in comments cited by Reuters news agency.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. But outside a hospital where bodies of the train crash's victims were being brought, a banner was hung claiming that any systemic failings would be covered up in the official investigation now under way.. At a silent vigil in Larissa on Wednesday to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had only been a matter of time.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. \"This is an inadmissible accident. We've known this situation for 30 years,\" a doctor based in Larissa, Costas Bargiotas, told AFP.. A vigil was also held in Athens, outside the offices of Hellenic Train. Later in the day, things turned violent in the same area, with police using tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones and lit fires in the streets.. At the site of the country's worst ever train crash, rescuers yet again worked through the night. . Families have been arriving at a nearby hospital to give DNA samples so that their missing loved ones may be identified.. But this will become an increasingly difficult process as more remains are retrieved of those who were at the front of the passenger train and who bore the full force of the head-on collision and the fire that then ripped through their carriages.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage had reached 1,300C (2,370F), which made it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\"..

        "content": "The coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the ex-workers and compensate others who were affected.. In response, Starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies.. \"We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review,\" Starbucks told the BBC.. In a more than 200 page decision, Michael A Rosas, who is a federal administrative law judge, also ordered Starbucks to rehire another worker that he ruled had been illegally forced out of their job.. Mr Rosas said Starbucks had showed \"a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights\" in response to union campaigns.. The judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay.. It also repeatedly sent high-ranking staff to stores \"in order to more closely supervise, monitor, or create the impression that employees' union activities are under surveillance,\" he said.. The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to safeguard employees' rights to unionise at their workplaces.. Michael Sanabria, a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, said the ruling was \"such a massive win for us, and for the labour movement as a whole.\". \"The decision results from months of tireless organising by workers... demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,\" said Michelle Eisen, a barista at another Starbucks location in Buffalo.. Last year, workers at around 270 of Starbucks stores across the US voted to join unions, despite opposition from the firm. Starbucks has around 9,000 company-owned stores in the US.. Union campaigners have accused the company of dragging its feet at the bargaining table and violating labour laws as it tries to shut down the movement.. Starbucks - which has long prided itself on its reputation as a progressive, worker-friendly employer - has said it respects workers' right to protest.. In recent months the company has raised pay and made other changes in response to the discontent.. This video can not be played. Watch: How UK strike rules could be about to change. ",
