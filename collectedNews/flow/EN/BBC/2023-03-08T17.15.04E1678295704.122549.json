        "content": "Watch: Protesters face tear gas and water cannons - as MPs brawl in parliament - over a \"Russian-style\" bill. On Tuesday, demonstrators clashed with police who used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse them.. The government said 50 police officers were hurt and equipment was damaged.. Some 66 people were arrested, including an opposition leader who was reportedly beaten. . Some protesters in Tbilisi were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags.. There has been widespread international condemnation of the bill. It would require non-governmental and media organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as \"foreign agents\", or face hefty fines and possible imprisonment. . The opposition says the Russian-style law marks a shift towards authoritarianism and would damage Georgia's chances of joining the EU. . On Tuesday, police warned protesters to disperse with a repeated message blaring through loudspeakers. Eventually, officers in riot gear cleared the Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament.. US state department spokesman Ned Price said the draft legislation would be a tremendous setback and \"would strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\".. The EU is currently considering Georgia's application for candidate status and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\". Many of those protesting waved EU flags.. Russia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media. . \"The law is Russian as we all know... We don't want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency. . Speaking via video during a visit to New York on Tuesday, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". But inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law.. On Monday, scuffles broke out at a committee hearing into the proposed legislation, with one pro-government MP slapping the leader of the largest opposition party. . Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\". . It added that parliament's advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia's clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\". . The two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People's Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party. . The group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). . Georgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency. . At a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy's statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. ",

        "content": "Mr Roldugin reportedly placed $50m (£42m) in Swiss accounts between 2014 and 2016, with no credible explanation of where the money had come from.. At the time, he presented himself as a cellist on a modest income.. He had become famous as a musician but did not earn vast sums. He once told the New York Times he was no businessman, and certainly not a millionaire.. So where did he get millions of dollars to put into Swiss bank accounts? . This is the question Zurich prosecutors say the accused former bankers should have asked. It was well known the cellist was a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is even rumoured to be godfather to Mr Putin's daughter.. Under Swiss law, banks are required to reject or close accounts if they have doubts about the account holder, or the source of the money. . They are also supposed to handle \"politically exposed persons\" with extreme care. As a known friend to the Russian leader, investing millions in Switzerland after the illegal annexation of Crimea and subsequent sanctions against Russia in 2014, Sergei Roldugin should have rung alarm bells. Prosecutors will allege that did not happen.. The case is being seen as a test of how rigorously Switzerland enforces its money laundering laws, which, on paper at least, are quite strict. . Swiss authorities have worked hard in recent years to move away from the image of Switzerland as a country in which even the dirtiest money from the most brutalist dictator or most corrupt businessman can be washed whiter than white. . Mr Roldugin's questionable money was first revealed, not by Swiss investigators, but by journalists, including a team from BBC Panorama, involved in an international investigation of the Panama Papers data leak organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2016.. They discovered evidence of suspicious transactions involving Mr Roldugin's offshore companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as his Swiss bank accounts.. Only after that evidence appeared did Swiss prosecutors launch their own investigation. Their indictment, now before the court in Zurich, suggests the musician was acting as \"Putin's wallet\", channelling funds via bogus companies in Cyprus and Panama into Gazprombank in Zurich. . The four accused are charged with failing the \"due diligence\" test, in not checking - or turning a blind eye to - the real source of his money. They have all pleaded not guilty.. Gazprombank has since wound up its operations in Switzerland, and Sergei Roldugin himself is on the Swiss sanctions list. . But, if convicted, the four bankers face only mild, suspended jail terms of up to seven months. To secure a guilty verdict at all, prosecutors will have to convince the court that the Roldugin millions in fact belonged to Vladimir Putin.. Not an easy task now that the usual co-operation between states - in this case Switzerland and Russia - on money laundering investigations is not happening. . No-one really knows how much President Putin, and those close to him, actually have. His stated salary is only a little over $100,000 (£84,400), the Swiss indictment points out. . But there are rumours his fortune could be worth a staggering $125bn (£105bn), carefully stashed away in a complex web of shell companies and accounts of friends like Sergei Roldugin.. That's why, despite the modest sentences, a guilty verdict could be so significant. It would send a signal not only to Russia's president, his friends, and the rest of his political establishment, that their cash can no longer be so easily hidden, but also to the professionals who have administered their funds.. \"Roldugin is not alone in his alleged role as one of 'Putin's wallets',\" said Tom Keatinge, head of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute.  . \"Those banks and law firms providing services to other close connections of Vladimir Putin should be on notice that the authorities are clearly energised to make their case in court.\".

        "content": "The electronic voting firm accuses the network of promoting baseless claims of vote-rigging in the election.. Fox News denies defamation and says on-air comments were taken out of context. . The latest filings in the case suggest Mr Carlson expressed his dislike of the outgoing US president two days before Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to derail lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden's election win. . \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\" he wrote in a text sent on 4 January 2021. \"I truly can't wait.\". \"I hate him passionately,\" he added. . Mr Carlson, the top-rated host on the conservative network, also appeared to denigrate the Trump presidency in these private messages, despite lauding his achievements on air.. \"That's the last four years. We're all pretending we've got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it's been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn't really an upside to Trump.\". Dominion argues in its lawsuit that top executives and some hosts at the conservative cable network knew that the conspiracy claims pushed by Donald Trump and his allies on Fox News programmes were false but still put them on air. . Previous filings have revealed that even Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of Fox News, acknowledged some of the network's stars endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.. In a statement provided to the BBC's US partner CBS News on Tuesday night, Fox News said: \"Thanks to today's filings, Dominion has been caught red-handed again using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press.\" . A jury trial is expected to begin in Delaware in April.. The text message revelations come amid a fresh round of criticism that Mr Carlson misrepresented exclusive security-camera footage given to Fox to downplay the severity of the riot two years ago at Congress.. Mr Carlson showed the previously unseen clips on Monday night and argued it \"does not show an insurrection or a riot in progress\", but rather \"mostly peaceful chaos\". . Criticism of the segment came from Democrats . , the head of Capitol police, and the family of the police officer whose death was mentioned by Mr Carlson on the show. . ",
