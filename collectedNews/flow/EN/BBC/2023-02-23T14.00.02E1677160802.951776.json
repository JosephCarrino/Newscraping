        "content": "The two Spectrum News 13 journalists were covering the killing of a woman in the area that morning when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . Spectrum News 13 identified the reporter as 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, who was killed, and photojournalist Jesse Walden who was injured. . The other two killed in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have not yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",

        "content": "Beijing has maintained that the balloon was a weather ship blown off course.. But Washington says the balloon was part of a sprawling Chinese intelligence collection programme.. As the balloon flew over US territory, at least two planes gathered information on its features and trajectory.. A senior State Department official said earlier this month that fly-bys revealed it \"was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations\".. Officials first became aware of the balloon when it crossed into Alaskan airspace on 28 January.. Fighter jets belonging to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) - a joint operation between the US and Canada - identified the foreign object, but the military did not shoot it down at the time.. Officials explained they could not shoot the balloon down over land because its size and likely debris field posed a threat to civilians on the ground. . One defence official told US lawmakers earlier this month the balloon was as tall as the Statue of Liberty and had \"a jetliner-size payload\".. The image released on Wednesday was taken the day before the balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February. The photo has reportedly \"gained legendary status\" inside the Pentagon.. The balloon was said to be hovering at 60,000 feet (18,200m) in the air.. U-2 planes routinely fly at altitudes over 70,000 feet, according to the Air Force.. The single-seater reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, were previously flown by the CIA. Pilots are required to wear full pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts.. Recovery efforts for the balloon's scattered remnants in the Atlantic Ocean ended last Friday.. Pieces of the debris, including its payload, have been recovered and are being studied, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. ",

        "content": "Official figures published last month showed Japan's rate of inflation was at its highest level in over 40 years.. That has put pressure on businesses and authorities to help people as their spending power shrinks.. Each year Japanese firms typically hold pay talks with unions for weeks before announcing their decisions around the middle of March.. The car makers have not said why this year's announcements were made earlier than usual.. On Wednesday, Toyota said it will meet union demands for pay and bonuses, with wages increasing by the most in 20 years.. Toyota's incoming president Koji Sato said that he hoped the move would have a positive impact across Japan's motor industry and \"lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company.\". The company declined to provide further details when approached by the BBC.. Meanwhile, rival car maker Honda told the BBC that it had \"fully answered\" union requests for wage increases and bonuses.. The company said it will raise salaries by 5%, marking the biggest increase since 1990 and above Japan's rate of inflation.. A Honda spokesperson said the extra money will largely be distributed to younger employees as starting salaries are boosted.. \"Despite the severe business environment, management has a strong desire to create an environment in which all employees can... push forward with their work with a sense of urgency,\" the spokesperson added.. Earlier this year, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida called on firms to raise wages to help people struggling with rising prices.. In January, the owner of fashion chain Uniqlo, Fast Retailing, said . . . The company said the new pay policy would apply to full-time employees at its headquarters and company stores in Japan from the beginning of March..
