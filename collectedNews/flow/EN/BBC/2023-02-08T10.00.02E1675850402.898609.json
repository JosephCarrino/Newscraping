        "content": "Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said the project posed an unacceptable risk to the World Heritage area, which is already highly vulnerable.. The mine's owner, the controversial Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, has not yet responded to the rejection. . His firm, Central Queensland Coal, had proposed to build an open-cut mine about 700km north-west of Brisbane, that would produce both thermal and coking coal and operate for about 20 years.. Ms Plibersek had last year flagged that the federal government might block the mine. After opening it to public consideration, her department received more than 9,000 submissions in 10 days - the majority calling for the project to be stopped.. The Great Barrier Reef - the world's largest coral reef system - has suffered .  due to rising sea temperatures and its outlook is \"very poor\", authorities say.. The Queensland state government had last year also recommended their federal counterparts reject the proposal, saying the environmental risks were \"significant\".. Minister Plibersek's department agreed, finding sediment and run off from the open-cut mine was likely to damage the Reef and local water resources.. \"I've decided that the adverse environmental impacts are simply too great,\" the minister said in a video statement on Wednesday.. While state governments have rejected proposals before, it is the first time a federal Environment Minister has used their powers to do so.. Australia's Labor government - elected in May - has been under pressure from some quarters to block any future coal and gas mining projects.. The country cannot help to stop catastrophic climate change - or keep global warming below a 1.5C increase this century - if it allows new mines, environmental advocates like the Greens political party say.. Australia is a major global supplier of fossil fuels. When exports are factored in, the country accounts for producing 3.6% of the world's emissions, but with only 0.3% of the world's population.. While the new government has significantly increased Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target, it has also said it will approve any new fossil fuel projects that make commercial sense.. ",

        "content": "Now the Russians are attacking from three sides, with regular troops and fighters from the notorious Wagner mercenary group. The Russians have reached one of the main highways into the city, and are closing in on the outskirts.. There is house-to-house fighting in some areas on the outskirts, with \"hard battles for every home\" according to the Ukrainian military.. It feels like Bakhmut is on borrowed time. If so, Ilya and Oleksii intend to use every second of it.. The two Ukrainian National Guardsmen move swiftly and silently across open ground on the frontlines and then plunge into a trench. . Their camouflage backpacks contain weapons of war - a drone, a modified hand grenade, and a Velcro strap. . The German-made grenade had a tail fin attached, made with a 3D printer, to ensure it exploded on impact.. Ilya - an IT guy turned intelligence officer - makes short work of velcroing the grenade to the drone. Then he launches it towards enemy forces nestled in their trenches, a kilometre and a half away. . \"We know there are a lot of Russian soldiers there, walking, living, and sitting,\" said Oleksii, the drone pilot. \"And so, we just give them [a] gift.\" . \"The aim is not to kill a lot of soldiers but to make them afraid of our sky, to make them watch out every second. It's psychological pressure.\". He shows us a drone's eye view as he releases the grenade over a frozen expanse. We can see the impact on his screen but can't tell if they were casualties below. . Oleksii says the fighting in Bakhmut is tough, emotionally and physically: \"It's hard, but we are staying here, and we will protect Bakhmut and the area around it as much as we can.\". But Ukraine is counting the cost and there's speculation it could withdraw to avoid further heavy losses.  . In the Kremlin, a clock is ticking - counting down to the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of its neighbour, on 24 February 2022. President Putin wants a victory before then. Taking Bakhmut would give him one, and bring him closer to his aim of capturing all of the mineral rich Donbas region.. To reach Bakhmut you drive along winding back roads. The route we used for previous trips last September is now classed as \"suicidal\" because of constant Russian attacks.. The city is now a shell. The thud of incoming and outgoing fire echoes through empty streets. Missiles have punched holes through buildings. Power and water supplies are long gone, along with most of the pre-war population of about 70,000. . But some families have remained here, with their children, sheltering in the shadows.. Anna, who is seven, is a bright spark in an airless dark basement. Tiny gold earrings glint in her ears, her blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she's wearing a pink sweater. Her colourful drawings line the walls but it still feels like a prison cell.. Anna lives with her mother Yulia, grandfather Valery, two cats and Mushka the dog. She proudly shows us her favourite soft toys, but her blue eyes stand out against her pale complexion. . \"I sit in the cellar almost all day long,\" she tells me in a lilting voice. \"Outside I take Mushka for a walk, but she's afraid of these booms and constantly comes back. Only in the morning, when it is quiet at dawn, I can take her out.\". Yulia sits in the gloom nearby, as Anna lists her friends who have already fled. \"I miss them all,\" she says. \"Arina might be in Poland, Masha in Western Ukraine. Diana went somewhere else. Everyone left.\". But Yulia is staying put with her daughter. \"Of course, I am worried,\" she tells me. \"But I think it is more or less safe. At least we have everything here, everything is prepared. We think nowhere in Ukraine is safe and we have no means to go abroad.\". Their basement shelter is well stocked with food and water, and they get regular deliveries from the White Angels, a unit of Ukrainian police who provide aid and carry out evacuations. . The team leader, Pavlo Dyachenko, lights up when he sees Anna. In the depths of war, they have forged a bond.. He has brought Anna a new sleeping bag to keep her warm, but he would rather be getting her and her family out of the line of fire. . \"I don't understand why they are deciding to stay,\" he said. \"Bakhmut is under attack in the evening, in the morning, in the night. It's very dangerous with bombing and shelling all the time.\". More thuds above ground amplify his point. . The shelling usually intensifies as midday approaches - part of the rhythm of warfare in Bakhmut. After exhausting overnight battles, troops on both sides sleep late into the mornings, before getting back to their guns.  . We race out of the city and onwards through rolling hills that offer a commanding view of the area. . \"These heights are more important for the Russians than Bakhmut itself,\" said a Ukrainian colleague. \"If they can bring their artillery here, they can target bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. \". Bakhmut holds, for now, but for how much longer.. ",

        "content": "He also vowed to defend US sovereignty in the wake of an incursion by an alleged Chinese spy balloon.. The speech was seen as a roadmap for a widely expected 2024 re-election bid.. Mr Biden's 73-minute address came as his public approval rating hovers near the lowest level of his presidency.. The opposition party delivers a response to the president's State of the Union every year. On Tuesday night, the Republican rebuttal was given by Arkansas' governor, who accused Mr Biden's government of being more preoccupied by \"woke fantasies\" than \"the hard reality Americans face every day\".. Mr Biden delivered the address to a packed chamber and high-profile guests - including U2's Bono - as well as Supreme Court justices. . Over the president's shoulder at the rostrum in the House of Representatives was one of his most vocal critics, the Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy.. Mr Biden extended an olive branch to the opposition party, which took over the lower chamber of Congress last month with vows to investigate the president's family and Cabinet.. \"To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can't work together in this new Congress,\" said the president, who has previously been accused by his opponents of divisive rhetoric.. \"We've been sent here to finish the job!\" he added.. Mr Biden also said that two years after supporters of his predecessor Donald Trump rioted at the US Capitol, America's democracy was \"unbowed and unbroken\".. As sometimes happens in State of the Union speeches, the president was at points heckled by opposition lawmakers.. This video can not be played. Watch: Three testy moments during the State of the Union. Mr Biden made minimal reference in the 7,200-word speech to the foreign policy imbroglio that has gripped the nation in recent days: a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that crossed US territory before the American military shot it down off the coast of South Carolina last weekend.. The president said he was committed to working constructively with China, but cautioned: \"Make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\" . Republicans have been demanding to know why Mr Biden waited a week to act. The president's administration has said it wanted to avoid risk to civilians from falling debris.. Mr Biden's speech was light on foreign policy in general, with Ukraine - the main topic of his 2022 State of the Union in the wake of Russia's invasion - getting a mention towards the end of this year's remarks. Mr Biden reiterated that the US would stand with Kyiv \"as long as it takes\".. The president focused on domestic issues, hailing the resilience and strength of the US economy. Unemployment dropped to a half-century low in January, and there are signs that the worst inflation in four decades is cooling. But the president acknowledged American families need more \"breathing room\".. Mr Biden aired his political wish-list, calling for an assault weapons ban, a minimum tax for billionaires, and access to pre-school for three and four-year-olds - though many of the proposals are likely to go nowhere in Congress. . He also condemned \"outrageous\" profits by oil companies, but drew scorn from Republicans in the chamber when he said: \"We're going to need oil for at least another decade.\". Following the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis last month, Mr Biden also challenged lawmakers to pass long-stalled reforms to policing, saying: \"Do something.\" Mr Nichols' mother and stepfather were in the audience as guests of First Lady Jill Biden. . The president also emphasised that \"most cops are good, decent people\", drawing a rare standing ovation by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.. The 80-year-old president is facing questions over his ability to serve a second presidential term, which would end when he is 86. . Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders - who at 40 is the country's youngest governor, and best known for her tenure as press secretary to former President Trump - delivered the Republican response to his speech. . The rebuttal is often delivered by young rising stars in the opposition party and frequently from outside Washington.. Mrs Sanders said: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn't start and never wanted to fight.\" .
