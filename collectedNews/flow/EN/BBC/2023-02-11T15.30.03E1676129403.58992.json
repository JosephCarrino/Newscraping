        "content": "Poland has been one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters since Russia invaded.. Last month, it was .  to send more tanks, ammunition and equipment to the front line.. This video can not be played. Poland's President, Andrzej Duda: \"This (sending jets) requires a decision by the allies\". President Duda's comments come despite him and President Zelensky having spoken this week - at the end of the Ukrainian leader's surprise headline-grabbing European tour. In London, President Zelensky used his speech in Parliament to call for the means to help fight Russia in the air:. \"I appeal to you and the world with the simple, and yet most important words - combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.\" . Ukraine's leader repeated that call in Paris and Brussels, in a rare departure from his country, under the tightest of security. He made headlines right around the world.. In Warsaw, President Duda told me sending F-16 jets would pose a \"serious problem\" because, with fewer than 50 of the aircraft in the Polish air force, \"we have not enough… and we would need many more of them.\" . He also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16s, need \"very serious need for maintenance\" so it's \"not enough just to send a few planes\". . With Poland being a Nato member, said Mr Duda, any decision to provide fighter jets had to be a \"joint decision\" - rather than one for any single country to take.. There are also nerves about whether providing planes would pull Nato directly into the conflict - and even into war against Russia itself. At the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, Duda said sending jets would \"open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict\". But - in direct response to Ukraine's request for planes this week - the Polish leader's comments are significant. . As Ukraine's neighbour, President Duda has been one of the most ardent supporters of President Zelensky and has contributed vast amounts of military aid, becoming the main supplier of heavy weaponry - including infantry fighting vehicles and artillery, drones and ammunition. . Duda was also at the forefront of pushing other allies to promise to provide tanks in recent weeks. . After notable reluctance from Germany, and a fraught debate across Europe about the risks of escalating the conflict, Leopard tanks will arrive in Ukraine, along with Challengers from the UK and Abrams from the US. . Poland has also provided homes to millions of Ukrainian refugees.. President Duda is adamant that \"weaponry has to be delivered to Ukraine all the time… it needs armaments.\" But it is clear he doesn't think sending combat aircraft in large numbers is likely from Poland or any other ally, at least in the short term.. The UK also made it clear pretty rapidly that sending planes to Ukraine was not realistic in the immediate future. . Yes, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing was off the table\" while he savoured his photo opportunity with President Zelensky in front of a tank this week - jeans tucked into unlaced boots, tieless, alongside the Ukrainian leader in his familiar army sweatshirt and combat trousers. . But before too long, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was making plain that would mean training for pilots and other support first. No UK jets will take off for Ukraine any time soon.. All week, British politicians have been falling over themselves to associate with the biggest political celebrity in the world right now, President Zelenksy, sharing their blurry phone snaps of his historic Westminster Hall speech and giving interviews about how moving it was to be there.. In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron greeted him like a film star in front of the Elysee Palace. EU leaders then frantically tweeted pictures of their own \"grip and grin\" moments with the Ukrainian leader later.. There is staunch support for President Zelensky without doubt. It's not just shown in flowery language and promises of commitment but, as President Duda explains, with guns, tanks and drones, plus support for refugees, rather than selfies with MPs. Western allies emphasise how countries have come together in a way that will have disappointed and frustrated Vladimir Putin. . Leaders, like Poland's president, underline the threat they feel to their own countries. Talking to him in Warsaw about the conflict is a world away from conversations in Westminster, with the Russian border at Kaliningrad only about 200 miles away. . The dilemma over jets is another example of the fraught calculations our leaders face. What is practically possible in terms of supporting Ukraine? And what is politically and diplomatically viable, without provoking a wider war?  . Poland and other countries' firm backing does not mean the West, or even Ukraine's closest allies, will or can say \"yes\" to his every request. One senior diplomatic source suggests President Zelensky is, of course, well aware of this. . His headline-grabbing journey this week was not just about the jets, and it doesn't look like it will soon result in \"wings for freedom\". But - as we approach the anniversary of Russia's invasion - his European tour's careful choreography, and powerful imagery will have reminded not just Western politicians but also their publics, of what is at stake..

        "content": "Air Force plane over Alaska after US strikes 'object'. Spokesman John Kirby said the unmanned object was \"the size of a small car\" and posed a \"reasonable threat\" to civilian aviation.. The object's purpose and origin was unclear, Mr Kirby said.. It comes a week after the American military destroyed a Chinese balloon over US territorial waters.. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Kirby said the debris field of the object shot down on Friday was \"much, much smaller\" than the balloon shot down last Saturday off the coast of South Carolina.. He said that the object was flying at 40,000ft (12,000m) over the northern coast of Alaska.. It had already flown across Alaska at a speed of 20 to 40mph (64km/h) and was out over the sea travelling towards the North Pole, when it was shot down. . Commercial airlines can fly as high as 45,000ft.. Helicopters and transport aircraft have been deployed to collect debris from the frozen waters of the Beaufort Sea. . \"We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,\" Mr Kirby said.. The object was first spotted on Thursday night, though officials did not specify a time. . He said two fighter jets had approached the object and assessed there was nobody on board, and this information was available to Mr Biden when he made his decision.. \"We're going to remain vigilant about our airspace,\" Mr Kirby asserted. \"The president takes his obligations to protect our national security interests as paramount.\". According to ABC News, the object seemed to have no propulsion.. It seemed to be floating, \"cylindrical and silver-ish grey\", reports the network's chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz, citing an unnamed US official. . Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder said the object was \"not similar in size or shape\" to last week's Chinese balloon.. He confirmed that an F-22 jet had shot down the object with a sidewinder missile at 13:45 EST (18:45 GMT) on Friday.. The warplane was scrambled from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.. Gen Ryder said a significant amount of debris had been recovered so far. It was being loaded on to vessels and taken to \"labs for subsequent analysis\", he added.. Officials said they had not yet determined whether the object was involved in surveillance, and Mr Kirby corrected a reporter who referred to it as a balloon.. He did not specify where exactly the object was shot down, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it had closed about 10 sq miles of US airspace airspace above Deadhorse, northern Alaska, before the F-22 fired.. The site is about 130 miles from the border of Canada, whose Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter he had been briefed on the \"object that violated American airspace\" and \"supported the decision to take action\". . No other objects of a threatening nature have been identified above the US at this time, according to the White House.. Mr Kirby said the object did not appear to have the manoeuvrable capability of the Chinese balloon and seemed to be \"virtually at the whim of the wind\".. Hours after the US shot down the balloon last Saturday, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called his Chinese counterpart via their special crisis line.. But Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe declined to pick up, according to the Pentagon.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\". . In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the Chinese balloon, maintaining that it was not \"a major breach\".. Late on Friday, five Chinese companies and one research institute were added to the US government's trade blacklist. Organisations were placed on the list for their alleged support of Chinese military aerospace programmes - including airships and balloons - the US Commerce Department announced.. ",

        "content": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but he appeared to blame fate on a visit to one disaster zone: \"Such things have always happened. It's part of destiny's plan.\". Turkey lies on two fault lines and has earthquake building codes dating back more than 80 years. But last Monday's double earthquake was far more intense than anything seen since 1939. The first quake registered magnitude 7.8 at 04:17, followed by another of 7.5 dozens of miles away. . It required a massive rescue operation spread across 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces.. But it took time for the response to build and some villages could not be reached for days. More than 30,000 people from the professional and voluntary sector eventually arrived, along with teams from many other countries. . More than 6,000 buildings collapsed and workers from Turkey's Afad disaster authority were themselves caught up in the earthquakes.. Those initial hours were critical but roads were damaged and search and rescue teams struggled to get through until day two or day three.. Turkey has more experience of earthquakes than almost any other country but the founder of the main volunteer rescue group believes this time, politics got in the way.. After the last major earthquake in August 1999, it was the armed forces who led the operation but the Erdogan government has sought to curb their power in Turkish society.. \"All over the world, the most organised and logistically powerful organisations are the armed forces; they have enormous means in their hands,\" said the head of Akut foundation, Nasuh Mahruki. \"So you have to use this in a disaster.\". Instead, Turkey's civil disaster authority now has the role, with a staff of 10-15,000, helped by non-government groups such as Akut, which has 3,000 volunteers.. The potential rescue effort was now far bigger than in 1999, Mr Mahruki said, but with the military left out of the planning it had to wait for an order from the government: \"This created a delay in the start of rescue and search operations.\". President Erdogan has accepted that search efforts were not as fast as the government wanted, despite Turkey having the \"largest search and rescue team in the world right now\".. For years, Turks have been warned of the potential of a big earthquake but few expected it to be along the East Anatolian fault, which stretches across south-eastern Turkey, because most of the larger tremors have hit the fault in the north.. When a quake in January 2020 hit Elazig, north-east of Monday's disaster zone, geological engineer Prof Naci Gorur of Istanbul Technical University realised the risk. He even predicted a later quake north of Adiyaman and the city of Kahramanmaras.. \"I warned the local governments, governors, and the central government. I said: 'Please take action to make your cities ready for an earthquake.' As we cannot stop them, we have to diminish the damage created by them.\". One of Turkey's foremost earthquake engineering specialists, Prof Mustafa Erdik, believes the dramatic loss of life was down to building codes not being followed, and he blames ignorance and ineptitude in the building industry. . \"We allow for damage but not this type of damage - with floors being piled on top of each other like pancakes,\" he told the BBC. \"That should have been prevented and that creates the kind of casualties we have seen.\" . Under Turkish regulations updated in 2018, high-quality concrete has to be reinforced with ribbed, steel bars. Vertical columns and horizontal beams have to be able to absorb the impact of tremors.. \"There should be adhesion between the concrete and steel bars and there should also be adequate transfer reinforcement in the columns,\" explained Prof Erdik. . Had all the regulations been followed, the columns would have survived intact and the damage would have been confined to the beams, he believes. Instead the columns gave way and the floors collapsed on top of each other, causing heavy casualties.. The justice minister has said anyone found to have been negligent or at fault will be brought to justice.. Critics such as opposition CHP party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu argue after 20 years in power President Erdogan's government has not \"prepared the country for the earthquakes\".. One big question is what happened to the large sums collected through two \"earthquake solidarity taxes\" created after the 1999 quake. The funds were meant to make buildings resistant to earthquakes. . One of the taxes, paid to this day by mobile phone operators and radio and TV, has brought some 88bn lira (£3.8bn; $4.6bn) into state coffers. It was even hiked to 10% two years ago. But the government has never fully explained where the money has been spent.. Urban planners have complained that rules have not been observed in earthquake zones and highlight a 2018 government amnesty that meant violations of the building code could be swept away with a fine, and left some six million buildings unchanged. . The fines brought in billions of Turkish lira in taxes and fees. But when a residential building in Istanbul collapsed in 2019, killing 21 people, the head of the chamber of civil engineers said the amnesty would turn Turkish cities into graveyards.. More than 100,000 applications were made for an amnesty in the 10 cities currently affected, according to Pelin Pinar Giritlioglu of Istanbul University, who says there was a high intensity of illegal construction in the area.. \"The amnesty played an important role in the collapse of the buildings in the latest earthquake,\" she told the BBC. . \"We cannot go anywhere by blaming each other and we should seek solutions,\" says Prof Erdik, who believes the problem goes beyond politics and lies in a system that allows engineers to go straight into practice after university with little experience.. Prof Gorur calls for the creation of \"earthquake-resistant urban settlements\" but for that there will have to be a shift in thinking, nowhere more so than in Turkey's most populous city.. \"We have been warning about a possible Istanbul earthquake for 23 years. So the policymakers of Istanbul should come together and make policies to make people, the infrastructure, the buildings and the neighbourhoods resistant to an earthquake.\". President Erdogan has called for unity and solidarity, denouncing critics of the disaster response as dishonourable.. \"I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,\" he told reporters in Hatay, near the earthquake's epicentre. . Many of the towns and cities in the affected areas are run by his ruling party, the AKP.. But after 20 years in power, first as prime minister and then as an increasingly authoritarian, elected president, he leads a highly polarised country.. \"We have come to this point because of his politics,\" said Mr Kilicdaroglu.. Campaigning for elections expected in May has not yet begun but he leads one of six opposition parties poised to announce a unified candidate in a bid to bring down the president.. Mr Erdogan's hopes of unifying the country ahead of those elections are likely to fall on deaf ears.. He has become increasingly intolerant of criticism and many of his opponents are in jail or have fled abroad. When an attempted coup against the president ended in bloodshed in 2016, he reacted by arresting tens of thousands of Turks and sacking civil servants. . The economy has been in freefall with a 57% inflation rate leading to a sky-high cost of living.. Among the government's first actions in response to the earthquake was temporarily blocking Twitter, which was being used in Turkey to help rescuers locate survivors. The government said it was being used to spread disinformation and police detained a political scientist for posting criticism of the emergency response.. Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who spent a year in jail in pre-trial detention, wrote from exile in Germany that the aftermath of the 1999 Turkish earthquake helped propel Mr Erdogan to power. . This latest disaster would play a part in the next vote too, he said, but it was not yet clear how.. ",
