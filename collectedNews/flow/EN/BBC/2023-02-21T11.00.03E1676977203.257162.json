        "content": "WATCH: Dashcam footage shows moment of new Turkey earthquake. A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and 31 subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit.. Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP news agency he had been looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquakes when the latest tremors hit. . \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall,\" he said. . In the city of Adana, the latest earthquake drove people to a volleyball centre that had been converted into a rescue centre following the first earthquake.. The authorities have told the BBC they believe as many as 600 people may have arrived overnight - seeking a sturdy, ground-level building in which to take shelter.. When the quake struck, people were reported to have run out into the streets rather than staying put, reflecting the fact that there is still significant fear two weeks after the initial disaster. . In Syria, some 470 injured people are said to have visited hospitals after Monday's quakes, which were also reportedly felt in Egypt and Lebanon. . In a visit to Turkey on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid, saying that America would help with earthquake recovery \"for as long as it takes\".. It is one of several countries to have offered their help in the wake of the first earthquake. . Rescue operations had .  in all but two areas, with hopes of finding people alive fading fast. .

He was initially lauded as the first openly gay Republican to win a seat in the House of Representatives as a non-incumbent when he won in New York's third district.. But within weeks, .  that called into question large portions of his CV, including his education and work experience, triggering a wave of further reporting.. He is alleged to have faced fraud charges in Brazil, presided over prolific campaign spending, lied about working for Goldman Sachs and about owning property - and even claimed to have produced the ill-fated Spider-Man musical on Broadway.. Speaking to Piers Morgan on Monday, Mr Santos said one of his \"biggest regrets in life\" was lying about obtaining a college education.. Asked why he had chosen to do so, Mr Santos said: \"Expectation on society, the pressure, couldn't afford it. . \"Decided I wanted to run for office, although I had built a very credible business career, but I just didn't have that part of my biography.\". \"I just went with it, if you are going to make up a lie, are you thinking at all?\" he added.. Mr Santos pointed out that he had run for the same Congressional seat in 2020 \"and I got away with it then\".. He reiterated his claim that he had never said he was Jewish, and repeated what he described as a \"party-favourite joke\" by describing himself as \"Jew-ish\".. Challenged over a claim that his mother was in the South Tower of the World Trade Centre in New York City on 9/11, Mr Santos said: \"That's true.\". \"I won't debate my mother's life as she's passed in [2016] and it's quite insensitive to try to rehash my mother's legacy,\" he said.. He added: \"She wasn't one to mislead me... I stay convinced that's the truth.\". The 34-year-old, who has faced calls from within his party to resign, was asked about the experience of the scrutiny he has come under.. \"It's uncomfortable,\" he said. \"I can't stand it and a lot of people think I love it, I just can't stand it... you need to learn how to deal with it and that's what I'm doing.\". Asked about an apology, Mr Santos said: \"I have looked inside a camera and said sorry... If you can ask for forgiveness, I think that is the first step.\". On whether he would have wanted to run for office knowing the pressure that would follow, Mr Santos said simply: \"Absolutely not.\".

        "content": "While 2022 was a record year for guns found at US airport checkpoints, the TSA says, 2023 may well beat it.. Officers in Seattle, Washington DC and Indianapolis have all raised the alarm.. The TSA intercepted a record 6,542 guns at airport checkpoints across the US last year. Some 88% of them were loaded with ammunition. . Travellers are allowed to pack unloaded firearms inside checked luggage that typically goes into an aircraft's hold. They are also required tell the airline they intend to travel with weapons at check-in.. But guns are not allowed in carry-on bags or passenger cabins, even if a passenger has a concealed weapon permit.. The TSA intercepts guns at airport security checkpoints and reports some airports are seeing a surge in numbers in some places that are ahead of comparable figures last year.. The 14 February discovery in New Orleans was especially notable due to the volume of ammunition discovered - it was the second gun intercepted at the city's airport that day.. In January, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport saw three guns come through a TSA checkpoint in a single week. Indianapolis International Airport detected four separate loaded guns in one week.. \"It's disturbing that so many Indianapolis passengers have made the irresponsible decision to bring a firearm to the checkpoint in just the first month of the year,\" says Aaron Batt, TSA's Federal Security Director for Indiana. . In Seattle, TSA officials counted 11 firearms discovered before the end of January, up from seven discovered by the same point in 2022.. \"This is not a new problem,\" according to Brian Schihabel, TSA Federal Security Director for Nebraska. \"But it is one that must be addressed since we have reached an unacceptable level of firearms coming through our security checkpoints.\" He hopes the growing numbers serve as a wake-up call for those who choose to travel with firearms.. Last year, the TSA raised the maximum civil penalty for a firearms violation to $14,950 (£12,419). Violators may also be arrested, have their weapons confiscated, and have their TSA PreCheck, the ability to skip normal security lines, revoked for at least five years. . Yet numbers continue to go up. The TSA has intercepted more firearms every year since 2010 except for 2020, when the pandemic slowed travel worldwide. . Experts suspect part of the problem may be simple to explain.. \"What we see in our checkpoints really reflects what we're seeing in society,\" TSA administrator David Pekoske . . \"In society there are more people carrying firearms nowadays.\".

        "content": "The men had held a wedding ceremony in 2019, but same-sex marriage is not recognised in South Korea.. Activists say the ruling is a leap forward for LGBT rights in the country.. However, the case will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  . The plaintiff, So Seong-wook said he welcomed the ruling and \"recognition of a very obvious right that has not been given\".. In 2021, he sued the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) after being denied coverage on his partner Kim Yongmin's plan.. The couple had been granted coverage at first, but this was then revoked as the NHIS said they had made a mistake in granting it to the same-sex couple.. Celebrating the ruling, Mr So praised the court for seeing \"the principle of equality as an important issue\".. \"I think it has a great meaning for LGBTQ people who have been in a discriminatory situation, those who support them and all those who are discriminated against,\" he told the BBC.. The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's verdict. It found spousal coverage under the NHIS extended to not just families as defined by law. . It also found that denying same-sex couples such benefits amounted to discrimination.. \"Everyone can be a minority in some way. To be in the minority is to be different from the majority and cannot be wrong itself,\" the court judgement read.. \"In a society dominated by the principle of majority rule, awareness of the rights of minorities and efforts to protect them are necessary.\". A Human Rights Watch report last year found that discrimination against LGBT people in South Korean society remained \"pervasive\". . Same-sex couples  - without the legal status of marriage - are often excluded from government benefits for newlyweds.. After Tuesday's court ruling, Amnesty International released a statement saying: \"There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTI community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome.\".
