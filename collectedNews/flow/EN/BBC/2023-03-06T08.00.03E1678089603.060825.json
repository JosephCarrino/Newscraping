        "content": "Video shows fire engulfing part of the camp, destroying shelters made from bamboo and tarpaulin. No casualties have been reported. But the blaze razed 2,000 shelters after spreading quickly through gas cylinders in kitchens, officials said.. Police are investigating if the fire was an act of sabotage. One man has been detained, local media reported.. The camp in the south-east is believed to be the world's largest refugee camp.. Most of its residents, Rohingya refugees, had fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.. On Monday, hundreds had returned to the Cox's Bazar area to see what they could salvage from the ruins.. The blaze had started at about 14:45 local time Sunday (08:45 GMT) and quickly tore through the bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters, an official said.. \"Some 2,000 shelters have been burnt, leaving about 12,000 forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals shelterless,\" Mijanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee commissioner, told AFP news agency.. The blaze was brought under control within three hours but at least 35 mosques and 21 learning centres for the refugees were also destroyed, he added.. Photos are now emerging that show the extent of the devastation. . Many of those who lived there can be seen picking through the charred area, where only metal struts and singed corrugated roofing remains.. Hrusikesh Harichandan, from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the BBC there had been \"massive damage\" to the camp.. He said basic services such as water centres and testing facilities had also been affected.. \"My shelter was gutted. [My shop] was also burnt,\" Mamun Johar, a 30-year-old Rohingya man, told AFP.. \"The fire took everything from me, everything.\". Thick black clouds were seen rising above Camp 11, one of many in the border district where more than a million Rohingya refugees live. . It will be difficult to relocate the estimated 12,000 people affected by the fire- given the already overcrowded conditions in the \"mega camp\", said Hardin Lang from Refugees International.. Delivering basic services to those people in other parts of the camp would also be a challenge because many services - health clinics, schools - have been destroyed. . \"This is in essence an acute incident on what was already a chronically very vulnerable and precariously poised population,\" he told the BBC.. The camps, overcrowded and squalid, have long been vulnerable to fires.. Between January 2021 and December 2022, there were 222 fire incidents in the Rohingya camps including 60 cases of arson, according to a Bangladesh defence ministry report released last month.. In March 2021, .  after a huge fire tore through a camp in the settlement.. The refugee camp houses people who fled from Myanmar following a military crackdown against the Rohingya ethnic minority. . The Rohingya are Muslims in largely Buddhist Myanmar, where they have faced persecution for generations.. The latest exodus of Rohingya escaping to Bangladesh began in August 2017, after Myanmar's military brutally retaliated when a Rohingya insurgent group launched attacks on several police posts.. ",

        "content": "The agreement was reached on Saturday evening, after 38 hours of talks, at UN headquarters in New York.. The negotiations had been held up for years over disagreements on funding and fishing rights.. The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 - the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.. That agreement established an area called the high seas - international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research - but only 1.2% of these waters are protected. . Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.. In the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, . These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. . Environmental groups .  that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.. The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".. Rena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.. Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.. Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. . Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. . Dr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.. He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that's our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\". Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\".. \"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.. Countries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. . Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\". ",
