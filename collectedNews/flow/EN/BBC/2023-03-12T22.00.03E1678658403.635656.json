        "content": "It is the latest energy firm to report record profits, after energy prices spiked following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.. America's ExxonMobil made $55.7bn, and Britain's Shell reported $39.9bn.. Aramco also declared a dividend of $19.5bn for the October to December quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.. Most of that will go to the Saudi government, which owns nearly 95% of the shares in the company. . Brent crude oil, the benchmark oil price, now trades at around $82 a barrel - though prices .  after Russia's invasion, and June.. \"Aramco rode the wave of high energy prices in 2022,\" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"It would have been difficult for Aramco not to perform strongly in 2022.\". In a statement on Sunday, .  the company results were \"underpinned by stronger crude oil prices, higher volumes sold and improved margins for refined products\".. Aramco's president and CEO Amin Nasser said: \"Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real - including contributing to higher energy prices.\". To address those challenges, he said, the company would not only focus on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production - but also invest in new lower-carbon technologies.. Aramco - the world's second-most valuable company only behind America's Apple - is a major emitter of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.. Responding to Aramco's announcement, Amnesty International's secretary general . : \"It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161bn in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel - the single largest driver of the climate crisis.\". She added: \"It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\". Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).. The Gulf kingdom has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents, and for the widespread use of capital punishment.. In a separate development on Sunday, Iran said its oil exports had reached their highest level since the re-imposition of . Oil Minister Javad Owji said exports increased by 83 million barrels in 2022 compared with the previous 12 months. In Iran, a new year starts in March. . Analysts say the rise is due to greater shipments to Iranian allies China and Venezuela. . Tehran's export revenues took a significant hit after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal five years ago.. The US sanctions, coupled with economic mismanagement and corruption, have meant that the Iranian economy has not had any substantive .  And by some measures, it is still 4-8% smaller than it was back in 2010.. ",

Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser, Cate Blanchett and Michelle Yeoh are the frontrunners in the acting categories.. The 2023 awards season has been one of the most unpredictable of recent years, with three of the four acting categories too close to call. . Winners have varied at the other major ceremonies, such as the SAG Awards, Baftas and Golden Globes, and there is a lack of consensus over who will triumph at the Oscars as a result.. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.. It will be the chat show host's third time hosting the Academy Awards. He most recently presided over the 2018 event.. The US comic is probably trying to forget about the other occasion, in 2017, when .  after the wrong best picture winner was mistakenly announced.. As part of a media call at the Dolby Theatre on Wednesday, Kimmel joked about how the venue's red carpet has changed colour for the first time since 1960.. Referring to .  Kimmel said: \"People have been asking if there's going to be any trouble this year, is there going to be any violence this year? . \"I certainly hope not. But if there is, I think the decision to go with a champagne carpet rather than a red carpet shows how confident we are that no blood will be shed.\". The decision to change the carpet's colour was actually made for practical reasons, .  The new one means organisers \"can transition more seamlessly from daytime arrivals to an elegant evening setting\".. Viewers in the US can watch the Oscars live on ABC. The network is also streaming the ceremony on its website and app.. In the UK, Sky will air the ceremony across four of its channels simultaneously - Sky Arts, Sky News, Sky Showcase and Sky Cinema Oscars.. Unusually, that means British viewers can watch the Oscars on Freeview and Freesat. It will also be available on streaming service Now (formerly Now TV). . The ceremony starts at 17:00 PT / 20:00 ET on Sunday. In the UK, it starts at midnight as Sunday becomes Monday.. The prizes are scheduled to be handed out over three hours - but the ceremony runs late almost every year, often by at least 30 minutes.. Traditionally, the four acting winners from the previous year's Oscars come back to present the prizes to their successors.. This year, three of 2022's winners are returning - Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur - but the fourth, Will Smith, is absent as .  for 10 years.. Other stars presenting categories this year include Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Samuel L Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, John Travolta, Emily Blunt, Jennifer Connelly and Florence Pugh.. Interestingly, Halle Berry has also been invited to present. She remains the only woman of colour to win best leading actress at the Oscars, but we could see the second this year with Yeoh.. Other category presenters include Paul Dano, Andrew Garfield, Cara Delevingne, Kate Hudson, Michael B Jordan, Jonathan Majors, Mindy Kaling, Eva Longoria, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Andie MacDowell and Riz Ahmed.. They will be joined by Antonio Banderas, Elizabeth Banks, Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek Pinault, Melissa McCarthy, Halle Bailey, Janelle Monáe, Questlove, Elizabeth Olsen and Pedro Pascal.. Excitingly, this year's winners are the hardest to predict for some time, due to the variation at the many precursor ceremonies. . The only acting category awards pundits are confident about is Everything Everywhere All At Once star .  winning best supporting actor. . Otherwise, it's all to play for. .  (The Whale) and .  (Elvis) have both won a host of best actor prizes at other major events and either one could take the Oscar. . There is another dead heat in the actress category, with .  (Everything Everywhere All At Once) enjoying a late surge of momentum, challenging the early frontrunner .  (Tár).. Best supporting actress is arguably the most open of the acting categories - with a three-way race between .  (Wakanda Forever), .  (The Banshees of Inisherin) and . (Everything Everywhere All At Once).. At this point, .  is the clear frontrunner, having won nearly every major precursor it needed to - with the notable exception of Bafta..

Best picture is decided via a preferential ballot - Academy members are asked to rank the 10 nominated films from favourite to least favourite..

For example, a crowd pleaser such as .  could be a dark horse in the best picture race due to the large number of second and third place votes it is likely to have received.. Rihanna will take to the Academy Awards stage exactly one month since .  She will perform Lift Me Up (from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), which is nominated for best original song. . The most likely winner in that category, however, is Naatu Naatu (from RRR) - which will be performed at the ceremony by Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava.. David Byrne, Son Lux and Stephanie Hsu will perform This Is A Life (from Everything Everywhere All at Once), while Diane Warren and Sofia Carson will perform Applause (from Tell It Like a Woman)..

Officially, these are the Academy Awards, but they have been known affectionately as the Oscars for decades.. There are three possible sources. One is the late US columnist Sidney Skolsky, who claimed he gave the award its nickname.. Actress Bette Davis claimed that the name derived from her observation that the backside of the statuette looked like that of her husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson.. But the most popular theory is one attributed to former Academy librarian Margaret Herrick, who declared that the golden statuette looked like her uncle Oscar.. ",

        "content": "Opponents say they threaten democracy.. At one of Saturday's rallies, opposition leader Yair Lapid said this was Israel's \"greatest crisis\".. In a separate development, Israeli troops shot dead three armed Palestinians near the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday, the Israeli army said. It said the gunmen had fired at an Israeli army post. . Palestinian officials have not commented on the incident. There has been a marked surge in violence between Palestinians and Israel . On Saturday, protest organisers said as many as 500,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Israel for the 10th consecutive week, in what the Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".. About 200,000 people turned up in Tel Aviv - many carrying Israel's national flag - to rally against planned reforms by Mr Netanyahu's hardline government.. A BBC producer in the city described the protests as the busiest yet, with a non-stop flow of demonstrators packing the streets until late into the night. . In remarkable scenes, crowds applauded Tel Aviv police chief Amichai Eshed as he walked in uniform through the rally. . On Thursday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had said he was transferring Mr Eshed to head a training division, amid reports the ultra-nationalist politician accused the commander of being too soft on protesters, whom he calls \"anarchists\". . But Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara later overruled Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the decision was being frozen, while national police chief Kobi Shabtai on Saturday said he had \"made a mistake\" in dismissing Eshed. . The clash over the commander's position is significant. It comes amid predictions of a possible constitutional crisis, involving Israel's civil service and security forces being unable to take orders from the government, if no compromise is reached on the planned reforms, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.. Speaking at the demonstrations in Tel Aviv, former Israel police chief Moshe Karadi described Mr Ben-Gvir's control of the force as an unprecedented danger. . He said the minister was \"a convicted felon, enacting a hostile takeover of the police and trying to turn it into a private militia to serve his political purposes\".. Mr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting terrorism over his backing of a Jewish extremist group. He has said police would have \"zero tolerance\" of demonstrators who block roads, with forces using water cannon and stun grenades against protesters last week. . Speaking in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Mr Lapid warned that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis.. \"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday .  But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.. In the northern city of Haifa, a record crowd of 50,000 marched on Saturday. . The reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges, and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. Last Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.. The government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. This video can not be played.
