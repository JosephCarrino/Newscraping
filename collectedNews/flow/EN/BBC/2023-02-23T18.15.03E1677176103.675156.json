        "content": "TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced allegations that it harvests users' data and hands it to the Chinese government.. TikTok insists it operates no differently from other social media.. EU spokeswoman Sonya Gospodinova said the corporate management board of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, had made the decision for security reasons.. \"The measure aims to protect the Commission against cybersecurity threats and actions which may be exploited for cyberattacks against the corporate environment of the commission,\" she said.. The ban also means that European Commission staff cannot use TikTok on personal devices that have official apps installed.. The commission says it has around 32,000 permanent and contract employees.. They must remove the app as soon as possible and no later than 15 March.. For those who do not comply by the set deadline, the corporate apps - such as the commission email and Skype for Business - will no longer be available.. TikTok said the commission's decision was based on mistaken ideas about its platform.. \"We are disappointed with this decision, which we believe to be misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions,\" a spokesperson said.. Last year, TikTok admitted some staff in China can access the data of European users.. TikTok's parent company ByteDance has faced increasing Western scrutiny in recent months over fears about how much access Beijing has to user data.. The US government banned TikTok last year on federal government-issued devices due to national security concerns.. The US fears the Chinese government may leverage TikTok to access those devices and US user data.. Last month, the Dutch government reportedly advised public officials to steer clear of the app over similar concerns.. In the UK, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, MP Alicia Kearns, recently urged users to delete the app in an interview with Sky News.. TikTok has grown rapidly and was the first non Meta app to reach three billion downloads worldwide, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower Data.. The social media service's chief executive Shou Zi Chew was in Brussels in January for talks with EU officials during which they warned TikTok to ensure the safety of European users' data, adding that it had a long way to go to regain their trust.. He insisted the company was working on a \"robust\" system for processing Europeans' data in Europe, an EU spokesman said at the time.. TikTok has also promised to hold US users' data in the United States to allay Washington's concerns.. There was no immediate comment on whether other EU institutions such as the European Council, which represents member states, or the European Parliament would take similar measures.. ",

        "content": "The journalists were covering the killing of a woman when the teenage suspect returned, police say. . It is unclear if they were targeted.. The suspect was armed when he was arrested and was not co-operating with police, said investigators.  . The other two victims in Wednesday's two attacks in Pine Hills, a suburb west of Orlando, have not yet been identified. . In a news conference, Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the journalists were \"in or near their vehicle\", which he said did not look like a TV station's official vehicle, when they were attacked at around 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT). . He said the Spectrum News 13 journalists had been reporting on a shooting that took place earlier in the day at around 11:00 local time, which saw a woman in her 20s fatally shot inside a car, when the suspect returned to the crime scene and opened fire. . After attacking the journalists, the alleged gunman - Keith Moses, 19 - went into a nearby home and shot the girl and her mother, the sheriff said. . The mother was in hospital in a critical condition, he added. . Other journalists nearby helped provide first aid to the victims, according to local reporters.. Spectrum 13 continued live coverage after the death of their reporter was announced. . Greg Angel, a news presenter for the station, said the injured journalist had \"been able to speak with investigators and colleagues\".. The suspect, Mr Mina said, \"has a lengthy criminal history, to include gun charges, aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and grand theft charges\".. He described him as an \"acquaintance\" of the woman shot in the morning, \"but as far as we know, he had no connection to the reporters and no connection to the mother and the nine-year-old\".. Asked about the possibility that the gunman purposefully targeted the reporters, Mr Mina said \"it's something we'll be taking a look at\".. He added that it was also possible the suspect mistook the journalists for police. . A reporter for Orlando TV station WESH 2 reported that she and her camera operator had left the crime scene only moments before the shooting. . \"We got a gut feeling\" and decided to leave for their own safety, said Senait Gebregiorgis. . Charter Communications, the company that owns the TV station, released a statement calling the attack \"a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community\".. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today,\" the company said. . White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted condolences, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the family of the journalist killed today and the crew member injured in Orange County, Florida, as well as the whole Spectrum News team.\". There were 40 journalists killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Only one of those killed was in the United States. . ",
