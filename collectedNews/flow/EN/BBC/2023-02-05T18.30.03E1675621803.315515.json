        "content": "The pardons come on the eve of the anniversary of the Islamic revolution in 1979.. Demonstrations erupted last September following the death in custody of a woman held by Iran's morality police.. Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab, or headscarf, \"improperly\" - in violation of Iran's strict dress code for women.. Authorities have portrayed the protests - which are still continuing - as foreign-backed \"riots\" and at times have responded with lethal force.. Human rights groups say more than 500 demonstrators have been killed, including 70 minors, and around 20,000 have been arrested.. Protests around the country have slowed considerably since the first of the hangings began.. Iran's state media says Ayatollah Khamenei's latest pardons came after a letter from the head of the judiciary framed many of those detained as young people who'd been led astray by foreign influence and propaganda. . The letter claims that a number of protesters had expressed regret and asked for forgiveness.. But those charged with more serious offences - such as spying for foreign agents, murder or destruction of state property - will not be pardoned.  . The measure will also not extend to any dual nationals currently being detained.. Under Article 110 of the Iranian constitution, the country's supreme leader has the authority to issue pardons at the recommendation of the judiciary.. This video can not be played.

Before leaving, he told the crowd: \"Dear brothers and sisters, I return to Rome with you even closer to my heart.\". Excited Catholics, some who camped overnight for the Mass, told Reuters it was a joyful moment.. \"To this moment I do not sleep, I was very excited,\" Jovana Buyom said.. \"We are really very happy with the coming of Pope because he will give us the message of peace, we can unite as South Sudanese people,\" Juaj Bol Ayuel said.. The Mass, which took place at the John Garang Mausoleum in front of an audience of 70,000 according to estimates, was filled with cheerful worshippers waiving flags and deep in prayer. . The religious ceremony fell on the last day of the Pope's visit to South Sudan, which was his first to the country.. Since it got independence in 2011, the country has been wracked by civil war after the president fell out with his then vice president in 2013.. Despite a peace deal in 2018, violence driven by ethnic tensions has continued - more than 400,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict.. At least 20 people were killed in a cattle raid on the eve of the religious leaders' visit.. The Pope, who visited the country alongside other Christian leaders - the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rev Iain Greenshields - has been on a peace mission and pleaded with South Sudanese clergy to raise their voices against injustice on Saturday.. He also told them that they cannot remain neutral against injustice: \"If we want to be pastors who intercede, we cannot remain neutral before the pain caused by acts of injustice and violence. To violate the fundamental rights of any woman or man is an offence against Christ.\". The Pope had a similar message of peace and reconciliation when he visited the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this week.. This video can not be played. Why is Pope Francis in South Sudan?. ",
