        "content": "Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. A local official says . .. But Deputy Mayor Oleksandr Marchenko said at the weekend that Russia had not yet gained control of the city.. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner private army involved in the Russian campaign, .  amid apparent friction between his fighters and regular Russian forces. . He also says his representative had been barred from a Russian military headquarters.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin. . Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine it annexed last September after referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Mr Zelensky said in his evening address that he had discussed Bakhmut with senior generals..  \"[They] responded not to withdraw, but to strengthen [our defences],\" he said..  \"The command unanimously supported this position. There were no other positions. I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut.\". The comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that armed forces commander Valery Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.. Most defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.. And at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were .  while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.. Ground forces commander Olexandr Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".. \"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\".

        "content": "The limestone sphinx with its \"smiley face and two dimples\" is thought to represent Roman Emperor Claudius.. It is much smaller than the famous Sphinx in the Pyramids of Giza, which is 20m (66ft) high.. The artefacts were found inside a two-level tomb in the temple of Dendera in Qena Province, 450km (280 miles) south of the capital of Cairo.. Emperor Claudius, whom archaeologists believe the statue's smiling features may belong to, extended Roman rule into North Africa between 41 and 54 AD.. Archaeologists will study the markings on the stone slab, which could reveal more information on the statue's identity, the ministry said.. Beside the \"beautifully and accurately carved\" sphinx, archaeologists also found a Roman-era stone slab with demotic and hieroglyphic inscriptions.. The limestone shrine includes a two-layer platform and a mud-brick basin from the Byzantine era.. Some experts see these discoveries by the Egyptian government as a way of attracting more tourists, to revive its tourism industry amid a severe economic crisis in Egypt.. ",

        "content": "Rival political party leaders have called for a public inquiry. . China has denied any election interference, calling the claims \"purely baseless and defamatory\".. Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday, Mr Trudeau said the reports challenging Canada's \"sovereignty\" are shocking, and \"strike us to our very core as Canadians\". . \"I will be appointing an independent special rapporteur, who will have a wide mandate and make expert recommendations on combating interference and strengthening our democracy,\" Mr Trudeau said.. The rapporteur has not yet been chosen, he said, adding that the appointment will be made in the coming days.. Mr Trudeau also said he would ask members of parliament and senators in the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (Nsicop) to begin a new probe of election security. . He added that Canada has long been aware of meddling attempts by China, as well as Iran and Russia. . The countries, as well as several other non-state actors, \"have attempted to interfere not only in our democracy, but our country in general\". . \"This is not a new problem,\" he said.. A series of reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper and broadcaster Global News in recent weeks, based on leaks from Canadian intelligence sources, detailed alleged attempts by China's Communist Party to interfere in the last two federal elections.. Chinese officials have dismissed the reports as \"purely baseless and defamatory\" and as \"hype\".. Conservative politicians have said publicly they were aware of interference in 2021 race, and believe it had cost them several seats - though not enough to change the election result, which Mr Trudeau's Liberals won with a 41-seat lead.. A federal public report last week found that efforts to meddle in the 2021 federal election did not affect the results. . Federal opposition parties - the New Democrats and the Conservatives - have been pushing for an \"independent and public\" inquiry into the accounts.. In response to Mr Trudeau's announcement, the New Democrats criticised the Nsicop committee probe, arguing it was not an \"acceptable substitute for a public inquiry\". . \"The way to stop foreign actors from acting in secret is to refuse to keep their secrets,\" said New Democrat MP Peter Julian.. The rapporteur will have the authority to recommend a public inquiry, Mr Trudeau said in response to critics.. \"We will abide by their recommendation,\" he said, calling the decision one of the official's first tasks after being appointed. . \"I know there are people out there who don't believe this is enough,\" Mr Trudeau continued. \"I get that. This is why we're entrusting further work to someone impartial.\". Also on Monday, the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they had opened an investigation into how information about the alleged meddling was leaked to Canadian news outlets.. A poll released last week by the Angus Reid Institute found that around 65% of Canadians say they believe that Beijing attempted to meddle in both recent federal actions. . Two-thirds of Canadians also said that the federal government should do more to combat election meddling.. ",

A flight attendant was asked to investigate and discovered the door's lock handle had been moved from the fully locked position and its emergency slide disarmed.. Cabin crew quickly suspected Mr Torres had moved the handle as he had been seen loitering by the door earlier.. When an attendant confronted him, Mr Torres allegedly asked if there were cameras in the area around the door..

Passengers on-board tackled Mr Torres after he attacked the flight attendant, it added.. Mr Torres had apparently been acting oddly, even asking a fellow passenger where the emergency exit was located during take-off..

Economic crisis and .  may make him more vulnerable than in previous elections.. A huge crowd of supporters cheered Mr Kilicdaroglu, a former civil servant, as he was chosen by a six-party opposition alliance.. Known as \"Gandhi Kemal\" or \"Turkey's Gandhi\" for his resemblance to Indian civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi, the quiet-spoken 74 year old offers a radically different vision in both substance and style to the fiery, charismatic Mr Erdogan's.. However, some of Mr Kilicdaroglu's allies fear he lacks drawing power.. He promised his supporters that he would govern Turkey through consensus and consultation.. \"Our table is the table of peace,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. \"Our only goal is to take the country to days of prosperity, peace and joy.\". He also said he would return the country to a parliamentary system - Mr Erdogan oversaw a transition to a presidential system in 2018, gaining sweeping powers.. The CHP was created by modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and is the country's oldest political party, though it has been out of power centrally since the 1990s.. However, Mr Kilicdaroglu has broadened its appeal by embracing minority groups and has formed alliances with right-wing parties.. He has also shown himself willing to challenge Mr Erdogan, a leader who has become increasingly intolerant of criticism.. In February's earthquake, in which more than 45,000 people were killed in south-eastern Turkey, Mr Kilicdaroglu led attacks on the government, which he said had allowed corruption and poor building standards..
