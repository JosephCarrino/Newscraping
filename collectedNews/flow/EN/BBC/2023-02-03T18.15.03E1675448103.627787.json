        "content": "Watch: \"At first I thought it was a star\". A senior State Department official said conditions were not right at this time for what would have been the first high level US-China meeting there in years.. A Chinese apology was noted, the official said, but described the balloon as a clear violation of sovereignty and international law.. The visit was to come amid fraying tensions between the US and China. America's top US diplomat was set to visit Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.. But there was consternation on Thursday when US defence officials announced they were tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United States.. While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, \"traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic\" and did \"not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground\", its presence sparked outrage.. Former US President Donald Trump was among those calling for the US military to shoot it down.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. A statement from China's Foreign Ministry said that it regretted the incident and would work with the US to resolve the issue.. However, the state department official said that while the US acknowledged China's claim about the balloon's purpose, it stood the assessment that it was being used for surveillance. . Another trip by Mr Blinken to China would be planned \"at the earliest opportunity\" the official said, adding that Washington planned to maintain \"open lines of communication\" about the incident.. Mr Blinken had been expected to visit China on 5 and 6 February. . A US official quoted by the Associated Press said that the decision to abruptly halt the trip was made by Mr Blinken and President Joe Biden. . Mr Biden did not take questions about the balloon following remarks about the US economy on Friday morning. . According to US officials, the balloon flew over Alaska and Canada before appearing in the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive military missile sites. . Although fighter planes were alerted, the US decided not to shoot the object down due to the dangers of falling debris, officials said. . Several Republican lawmakers - as well as former President Donald Trump - have criticised the decision and urged the US to down the balloon. . \"Shoot down the balloon,\" Mr Trump said in a short message on his Truth Social social media platform. . On Twitter, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the balloon incident was \"a destabilizing action that must be addressed\". . While US officials have not commented on the size and details of the suspected spy balloon, Chinese officials have previously publicly expressed interest in the potential military and intelligence-gathering potential of balloons. . \"Technological advances have opened a new door for the use of balloons,\" an article in the military-run Liberation Army Daily said last year. . In 2022, Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected Chinese balloons over its territory. . ",

        "content": "That was far more than expected, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.4% - the lowest rate since 1969. . Analysts are struggling to figure out what is happening in the world's largest economy, which is being buffeted by a mix of higher borrowing costs and rising prices.. Many forecasters have warned that the odds of a recession this year are unusually high, pointing to data which has indicated a recent pullback in consumer spending, declines in manufacturing and a sharp slowdown in home sales.. A recent survey by research company Morning Consult suggested nearly half of the public thinks the economy has already fallen into recession, or a period of decline.. Despite this, the labour market has remained strong - though the gains in January shocked even those economists who have argued against the gloomy predictions. . \"This is a breathtaking number,\" economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote on Twitter following the report. . Dante DeAntonio, director at Moody's Analytics, cautioned against reading too much into a single month of data.  . His firm still expects employment growth to slow \"dramatically\" in the months ahead, and warned that the probability of a recession remained \"uncomfortably high\".. But US President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings dropped last year as prices surged - with Republicans blaming his spending plans - said the report showed his critics were wrong in their grim interpretations of the economy. . \"For the past two years we've heard a chorus of critics write off my economic plan,\" he said. \"Today's data makes crystal clear what I've always known in my gut - these critics and cynics are wrong.\". The hiring in January was widespread, led by bars and restaurants, which are continuing to recover from job losses sparked by the pandemic. . The car manufacturing and tech industries were among the few parts of the economy to report job losses.. Those sectors are sensitive to borrowing costs, which shot up last year, as the US central bank took steps to stabilise consumer prices.. By raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve is aiming to cool demand, easing the pressures pushing up prices. . However, the increase in rates, coming at a time when price increases have started to ease, has raised fears that officials will tip the economy into a painful contraction, bringing economic activity to an abrupt slowdown that leads to firms to cutting jobs.. The head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said this week he was hopeful the US central bank can avoid that scenario.. But he warned that the Fed was focused on curbing inflation and remained worried that the job market was too strong to allow price growth to stabilise around the bank's 2% target.. Friday's report showed wages rose 4.4% over the 12 months to January.. Pay increases did not keep pace with price inflation last year and have shown signs of cooling in recent months. . \"It's difficult to see how wage pressures can possibly soften sufficiently when jobs growth is as strong as this and it's even more difficult to see the Fed stop raising rates and entertain ideas of rate cuts when there is such explosive economic news coming in,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. . \"The market is going to go through a rollercoaster ride as it tries to decide if this is good or bad news. For now, though, looks like the US economy is doing absolutely fine.\". ",

At least 11 people have died in the bad weather in the US south since Monday. . There were eight fatalities in Texas, two in Oklahoma and one in Arkansas.. About a dozen records are expected to be broken by Friday afternoon in several states, where a total of 82 million people will face temperatures of -17 Celsius (0 F) or lower. . In Maine, for example, parts of the state are expecting the lowest temperatures recorded since 1971. In the city of Portland, wind chill is expected to reach -41 F (-43 C). . In nearby Burlington, Vermont, Friday's highest temperature is expected to reach just -20 C (-5 F). . Boston, which is anticipating sub-zero wind chills, is currently under a cold emergency. Public schools have been closed in the city, as well as in nearby Worcester. . Temperatures in New York City and other major cities are also expected to bottom out in the single digits (Fahrenheit, around -13C to -17C) by Saturday, although forecasters predict they will rebound by the end of the weekend.. Temperatures in parts of Texas have climbed above freezing, and ice was expected to melt by Friday as temperatures keep rising.. More than 320,000 people were still without power as of Friday morning in Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi, according to poweroutage.us.. Emergency crews in Texas have responded to hundreds of collision calls since Monday, some of which have been fatal. Three men were killed in a crash near Brownfield, south-west of the Texas city of Lubbock, according to the state's Department of Public Safety. . One person in Austin was killed in a car pileup on Tuesday, local authorities said. A 45-year-old man died on Monday in Arlington after his SUV slid into a highway guardrail, while a student died in a rollover crash in Wolfforth, according to local outlet KCBD. . A 49-year-old woman was killed while driving on an icy road north of Eldorado, Texas officials told CNN. . In the neighbouring state of Oklahoma, in Custer County, a 35-year-old driver was killed on Thursday morning in a six-car pileup on icy roads, Oklahoma Highway Patrol said, according to local media outlets. . Dallas Police Department asked people to make sure their tyres are inflated, to slow down on icy roads and to avoid using cruise control. . ",

        "content": "Watch: \"At first I thought it was a star\". US defence officials said they believed the balloon, seen above sensitive areas in recent days, was in fact a \"high-altitude surveillance\" device. . But in a statement, China's foreign ministry said it was used for \"mainly meteorological\" purposes. . China \"regrets the unintended entry\" of the balloon into US airspace, it added.. The object flew over Alaska's Aleutian Islands and through Canada before appearing over the city of Billings in Montana on Wednesday, according to officials.. Montana is home to some of the US's nuclear missile silos. . The US decided not to shoot down the balloon because of the danger posed by falling debris, and the limited use of any intelligence the device could gather, a US defence official said. . However, the government prepared fighter jets in case the object had to be shot down. . The Chinese statement said the balloon had been blown off-course by unexpected winds. . \"Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course.. \"The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure.\". The statement referred to the incident as an \"unexpected situation\" and said Beijing would continue to communicate with the US side. . On Friday, Canada said it had summoned China's ambassador over the incident and will continue to \"vigorously express\" its position to Chinese officials. . The balloon has been reported in US media as being about the size of three buses. . During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, US defence officials declined to disclose the aircraft's current location and did not give information on where it was launched from.. They added that the balloon was \"appearing to hang out for a longer period of time\" than others tracked by the US over the past several years. . The unfamiliar sight caused confusion as the balloon hovered above Montana, with some people posting images of the pale round object high above the Earth's surface. . Billings office worker Chase Doak told the Associated Press news agency that he noticed the \"big white circle in the sky\" and went home to get a better camera.. \"I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,\" he said. \"So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.\". China initially warned against \"conjectures and hyping up the issue\" while it worked to \"verify\" the reports of the balloon, with state media outlet the Global Times accusing the US of aggravating tensions between the two countries. . Despite China's explanation, the incident is likely to increase tensions ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China next week. It will be the first visit to the country by a Biden administration cabinet secretary.. The top US diplomat will be in Beijing to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19.. ",

        "content": "It was spotted floating over the state of Montana, days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China.. The top US diplomat is expected to meet China's President Xi Jinping, making him the first in his role to do so.. \"Beijing is probably trying to signal to Washington: 'While we want to improve ties, we are also ever ready for sustained competition, using any means necessary', without severely inflaming tensions.. \"And what better tool for this than a seemingly innocuous balloon,\" independent air-power analyst He Yuan Ming told the BBC. . Balloons are one of the oldest forms of surveillance technology. The Japanese military used them to launch incendiary bombs in the US during World War Two. They were also widely used by the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.. More recently, the US has reportedly been considering adding high-altitude inflatables into the Pentagon's surveillance network. Modern balloons typically hover between 24km-37km above the earth's surface (80,000ft-120,000ft).. The US Department of Defence on Thursday said . . It also said it had \"very high confidence\" that the balloon belongs to China.. But China expert Benjamin Ho said Beijing had more sophisticated surveillance technology at its disposal. . \"They have other means to spy out American infrastructure, or whatever information they wanted to obtain. The balloon was to send a signal to the Americans, and also to see how the Americans would react,\" explained Dr Ho - coordinator of the China programme at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.. It may even be the case that China wanted the US to detect the balloon. . \"It's possible that being spotted was the whole point. China might be using the balloon to demonstrate that it has a sophisticated technological capability to penetrate US airspace without risking a serious escalation. In this regard, a balloon is a pretty ideal choice,\" said Arthur Holland Michel from the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.. Nevertheless, the experts point out that balloons can be fitted with modern technology like spy cameras and radar sensors, and there are some advantages to using balloons for surveillance - chief of which is that it is less expensive and easier to deploy than drones or satellites. . The balloon's slower speed also allows it to loiter over and monitor the target area for longer periods. A satellite's movement, on the other hand, is restricted to its orbital pass.. Although China has not admitted it launched the balloon, Mr Michel says it is unlikely anyone else could be responsible.. \"The [US Department of Defence] would likely not say that it is a Chinese balloon unless they have a fairly high degree of certainty that that is what it is.\". The balloon's anticipated flight path near certain missile bases suggests it is unlikely it has drifted off course, He Yuan Ming said.. ",
