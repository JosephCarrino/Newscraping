        "content": "\"It's unbelievable but true,\" he said. \"We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.\". Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.. Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.. Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.. \"Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,\" the 70-year-old leader said. \"We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.\" . Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments, but did tell reporters that \"as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond\". . Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, the World War Two conflict which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops and turn the tide of the war.. Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of World War Two. . Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he claims are leading the Kyiv government. . And he returned to the theme throughout his speech. . \"Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,\" he said. . \"Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West.\". But he vowed that while it was \"unbelievable but true\" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it. . Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the occasion, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled. . Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33. . The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated 5 million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria. . Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle.. Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade. . As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion. . Local media reported that local Governor Andrey Bocharov - who accompanied Mr Putin to the memorial complex - was not at the parade. He had not been seen since 24 January, leading to speculation that he was isolating before meeting the president. . Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take \"revenge\" against the West for aiding Ukraine. . \"Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,\" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv. . Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was \"increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions\" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy. .

        "content": "The Qatargate affair unfolded when a Greek lawmaker and three other suspects were arrested on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering.. One of the suspects then agreed to \"tell all\" as part of a plea deal.. Pier Antonio Panzeri is alleged to have led a network that took bribes from Qatar and Morocco in return for influencing the European Parliament. Some €1.5m (£1.3m) was recovered in cash in a series of raids in Brussels and Italy.. Qatar has denied allegations that it sought to gain influence over MEPs while Morocco has hit back at \"judicial harassment\" and \"media attacks\". . However, prosecutors have said Mr Panzeri has admitted \"criminal responsibility\".. Mr Tarabella's home was raided last month when Belgian police detained the four suspects. Prosecutors then asked the parliament to lift his immunity from prosecution as well as Mr Cozzolino's. Both men were members of the parliament's centre-left Socialists and Democrats grouping.. The votes happened with little ceremony in a matter of seconds when lawmakers began a session of the European Parliament on Thursday morning. MEPs simply raised their hands as the details were read out.. Marc Tarabella attended the vote himself, making his way through a scrum of reporters as he headed into the chamber. Afterwards he told me he had voted to waive his immunity in order to \"be able to respond to the investigators' questions and help authorities shed light on this affair\".. According to the parliament report on Mr Tarabella, he is suspected by investigators of backing \"certain positions within the European Parliament in favour of a third country in return for cash payments\" for two years. Testimony against him suggests several payments totalling €120,00-€140,000, the report adds.. \"Of course I deny any wrong,\" he told the BBC. Asked if had ever taken money to influence proceedings in the European Parliament he said: \"Never in my life!\". The parliament's report on his Italian colleague cites investigators alleging participation in a criminal organisation and money laundering. Mr Cozzolino's lawyers said last month that he was innocent and that he had carried out political activity in a \"free and transparent way, having nothing to do with the crimes being investigated\".. He resigned last month as head of the parliament's delegation that works with the Maghreb nations, including Morocco.. Last month prosecutors said Mr Panzeri, who is an Italian ex-MEP, had agreed to provide details about how the scandal worked and who was involved in return for a shorter sentence of a year in jail. He ran an NGO called Fight Impunity in Brussels. . His wife and daughter were freed from house arrest last week as part of the plea deal.. Three other suspects remain in jail on suspicion of corruption and money laundering:. Parliamentary immunity means MEPs cannot be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings because of opinions expressed or votes cast in their capacity as an MEP. But it can be waived, if requested by a national authority.. ",

Since his imprisonment, his health has deteriorated significantly and he has alleged he was poisoned by authorities.. Mr Saakashvili was arrested in 2021 after making a surprise return to Georgia by smuggling himself into the country on a ferry from Ukraine. He called for mass anti-government demonstrations, but was quickly arrested by Georgian authorities. . He was convicted in absentia of abuses of power while in office.. The Georgian Justice Minister Rati Bregadze said he was self-harming and his condition was a result of his refusal to eat. . Mr Saakashvili's medical team said his weight had dropped from 115kg (254 pounds) to 68kg (150 pounds) since his imprisonment.. Among the world leaders calling for his release were Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said authorities were \"torturing and killing\" him. . During a press conference, Mr Zelensky said he believed the current Georgian government was trying \"to kill\" Mr Saakashvili. . Mr Saakashvili was granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2015, and spoke only in Ukrainian at his court appearance, wearing a t-shirt with \"I am Ukrainian\" printed on it. He also served as the governor of the western province of Odesa between 2015 and 2016.. The Moldovan President Maia Sandu also called for Mr Saakashvili's immediate release;. \"Torturing an opposition leader to death is unacceptable for a country that wants to join the European Union,\" she wrote in a tweet.. Empathy, an organisation supporting victims of torture in Georgia, alleged on 1 December that Mr Saakashvili had been diagnosed with illnesses \"incompatible with imprisonment\" and that Georgian and foreign medical experts had found evidence of heavy-metal poisoning.. On Thursday, the European Parliament debated Mr Saakashvili's health, where the European Commissioner for Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn, said the Georgian government was obliged to provide him appropriate healthcare.. Late last year, Mr Saakashvili gave French President Emmanuel Macron a hand-written note reading: \"SOS. I am dying, I have very little time left.\". Georgian authorities have said Mr Saakasvhili is feigning his condition to secure a release from prison, and have accused him of self-harming.. ",

The 'Ndrangheta are now the most powerful mafia in Italy and their tentacles stretch across Europe and South America.. Greco, 63, was wanted for the murder of two brothers during a \"mafia war\" between two gangs in the early 1990s.. Stefano and Giuseppe Bartolomeo were beaten to death at a fishmonger's in the small town of Cosenza in January 1991. Their bodies were never found and are believed to have been dissolved in acid. . Greco was part of a rival gang and he was also accused of the attempted murder of another man later that year in the same town.. When a trial judge issued an arrest warrant for him in 2006, Greco went on the run. . Eight years later, he settled in the French city of Saint-Étienne, south-west of Lyon, eventually taking up the job of pizzaiolo in an Italian restaurant.. Greco took on a new identity, calling himself Paolo Dimitrio. By now he had been given a life sentence back in Italy and was the subject of a European arrest warrant.. But in July 2021 he was sufficiently confident of his new alias that he appeared in a local newspaper feature, boasting of his restaurant's \"regional and home-made recipes\" such as ravioli, risotto and tagliatelle. . Greco, using the name of a criminal from Puglia in the south-east of Italy, now had a grey beard and glasses. The feature called him an Italian by birth but at heart a local to Saint-Étienne.. He was, however, still being pursued by Italy's foremost anti-mafia prosecutor, Nicola Gratteri, who has spent decades tackling the rise of the 'Ndrangheta.. In a statement, Italy's Carabinieri military police said that since 2019, investigators had traced Greco's support network, which ultimately led them across the Alps to Saint-Étienne.. Interpol said . , with French authorities carrying out surveillance of Greco's location. Italian police then confirmed his identity and moved in to arrest him.. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi praised the police for bringing to justice one of Italy's worst criminals, while the head of the Calabria region, Roberto Occhiuto, said the arrest underlined Italy's commitment to the fight against all forms of organised crime..

It comes days after workers said their final goodbye to the iconic plane, dubbed the Queen of the Skies. . The 747 is one of the world's most recognisable planes, having been in production for more than 50 years, and is credited with starting the era of the jumbo jet, being the first aircraft to earn the nickname.. On Tuesday, thousands of employees from Boeing gathered at the company's factory in Everett, Washington - the home of the 747 since 1967 -  to say farewell. . Among those in attendance was actor John Travolta, an aviation enthusiast and private pilot. . As an ambassador for Qantas airlines, he remembered learning to fly the 747-400.. \"[It was] the toughest programme that any commercial pilot will ever have to endure,\"  he said.. Elsewhere in the crowd were also some of those who helped develop the jet in the 1960s - the so-called \"incredibles\".. The last 747 rolled off the assembly line 7 December, completing inspections, flight tests and getting a paint job before finally being handed over to Atlas, which operates the aircraft as freighters.. Designed in just 28 months, the 747 was the first ever twin-aisle jetliner and was first introduced by the now-defunct airline Pan Am in 1970.. Traditionally one of Boeing's best selling products, the 747 has suffered declining demand in recent years, as both the company and its European rival Airbus developed more fuel-efficient and profitable planes.  . In 2020, Boeing announced that it would end production. Its largest new jet, the delayed 777X, is not expected to hit the market until 2025.. ",

        "content": "The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints - Taiwan and the South China Sea.. The deal, which in part reverses the US' departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. . \"There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,\" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. . \"The US is not looking for permanent bases. It's about places, not bases.\" . The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will \"allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges\", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. . The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. . The US hasn't said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don't count China.. , saying \"US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability\". . \"The United States, out of its self interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,\" its embassy said in a statement.. These days the US is seeking access to places where \"light and flexible\" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. . In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. . Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. . The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. . Roll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the Malacañang Palace. . More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it's knocking on the Philippines' front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines' own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. . Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. . \"We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.\". \"We have very limited capability against the threat from China,\" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. . He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. . \"The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.\". But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. . The history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. . \"We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,\" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. \"The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There's a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.\". The US' return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country's left-wing groups. . While there won't be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. . The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.. The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. . \"The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,\" he says. \"It's buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels.\" . With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a \"rear access area\" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. . \"People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,\" Mr Poling says. . But Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China's rise, Professor Kraft cautions. . \"The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage.\" . Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. . In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China's state-run Global Times accused the US of \"setting a trap for the Philippines\" and \"trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China\".  . \"We are once again being caught in the middle,\" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. . \"The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.\" .
