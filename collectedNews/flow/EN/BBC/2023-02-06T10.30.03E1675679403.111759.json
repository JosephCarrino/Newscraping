        "content": "He added people with \"homosexual tendencies\" are children of God and should be welcomed by their churches.. His comments were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland.. Archbishop Justin Welby and Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, travelled with the Pope to South Sudan where they jointly called for peace in the war-torn country.. It is the first time the leaders of the three traditions have come together for such a journey in 500 years.. Archbishop Welby and Dr Greenshields praised the Pope's comments during a news conference with reporters on board the papal plane as they travelled from Juba to Rome.. \"I entirely agree with every word he said there,\" said Archbishop Welby, noting that the Anglican church had its own internal divisions over gay rights. . Last month the Church of England said it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to be married in its churches.. Expressing his own support, Dr Greenshields referred to the Bible, saying: \"There is nowhere in the four Gospels that I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whoever he meets, and as Christians that is the only expression that we can give to any human being in any circumstance\".. During the news conference Pope Francis repeated his view that the Catholic Church cannot permit sacramental marriage of same-sex couples.. But he said he supported so-called civil union legislation, and stressed that laws banning homosexuality were \"a problem that cannot be ignored\".. He suggested that 50 countries criminalise LGBT people \"in one way or another\", and about 10 have laws carrying the death penalty.. Currently 66 UN member states criminalise consensual same-sex relations, according to ILGA World - the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.. \"This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God,\" said the Pope.. \"God loves them. God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\". Under current Catholic doctrine, gay relationships are referred to as \"deviant behaviour\" and Pope Francis has previously . .. But some conservative Catholics have criticised him for making comments they say are ambiguous about sexual morality.. In 2013, soon after becoming Pope, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but added that homosexual orientation was not.. Five years later, during a visit to Ireland, Pope Francis stressed that parents could not disown their LGBT children and had to keep them in a loving family.. ",

Despite the warnings, ski resorts in western Austria have been filling up due to school holidays in Vienna.. Austrian police announced five deaths on Sunday, including that of a 59-year-old man who was using a snow plough in the western region of Tyrol. . They also recovered the bodies of a ski guide in Sankt Anton am Arlberg and a 62-year-old man who was cross-country skiing around the summit of Hohe Aifner.. On Saturday, a 17-year-old New Zealander, a 32-year-old Chinese national and a German man in his 50s - who were all said to be skiing off designated ski trails when avalanches hit - were also found dead.. In Switzerland, a 56-year-old woman and 52-year-old man were also killed by unstable snow in the south-east canton of Graubuenden on Saturday morning. Swiss police said a third member of their group managed to escape unharmed. . Avalanches are common in both countries. According to Austria's APA news agency, 30 avalanches were reported in the Tyrol region on Saturday alone - 11 of these involving people.. Austria's level four alert level means \"very large avalanches are likely\" - it advises inexperienced skiers to remain on open ski runs and trails and for experienced skiers to stay away from very steep terrain..

        "content": "President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops were fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman.. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister.. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party.. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry. . Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army.. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that \"war dictates personnel policies\". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries.. President Zelensky .  as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government. . At an earlier news conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February.. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine.. Mr Reznikov made similar comments to French TV . The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday.. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine.. \"I am sure that we will win this war,\" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, \"it will cost us more lives\". . Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat.. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area.. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were \"fighting to the last\".. Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago.. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region.. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months.. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: \"Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles.\" But, he added, \"we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning\".. The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town.. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire.. This video can not be played. Watch: Mum turns TV up to hide shelling from daughter. ",

        "content": "Watch: Beyoncé gets emotional on stage accepting record-breaking award. Beyoncé made history as she won best dance/electronic album for her euphoric dance opus, Renaissance.. In doing so, she overtook Hungarian-British conductor George Solti, whose record of 31 Grammys had stood for more than 20 years.. \"I'm trying not to be too emotional,\" said the star, accepting her prize.  . \"I'm trying to just receive this night.\". She went on to thank her family, including her late uncle Jonny, who helped make her stage outfits before she became famous.. Beyoncé has previously said his battle with HIV influenced her interest in dance music, and its historical ties to the LGBTQ community, on Renaissance.. Overall, Beyoncé won four prizes at the ceremony - but missed some of the early presentations after getting stuck in gridlocked downtown Los Angeles.. \"I'm surprised traffic could stop you,\" joked host Trevor Noah. \"I thought you travelled through space and time.\". Despite her success, Beyoncé was once again locked out of the coveted album of the year award.. She has now lost the prize four times, most notably in 2017 when her confessional masterpiece Lemonade was beaten by Adele's 25. . At the time, Adele used her acceptance speech to say Beyoncé was the more deserving winner (although she held on to the trophy).. This year, Harry Styles took the crown, with Grammy voters recognising the slick, radio-friendly pop of his third record Harry's House. . In his speech, the British star downplayed the importance of the prize. . \"On nights like tonight, it's obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music,\" said the singer.. \"I don't think any of us sit in the studio, making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these.\". However, he was visibly moved by the honour, adding: \"This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so, so nice.\". Earlier in the night, the star also won best pop album - receiving his award with a kiss from Jennifer Lopez. . \"This album from start to finish has been the greatest experience of my life,\" he said. \"From making it with two of my best friends to playing for people has been the greatest joy I could have asked for.\". Billed as \"music's biggest night\", the Grammys are the industry's most prestigious awards.. Sunday's show was attended by Adele, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, Shania Twain and Stevie Wonder, with performances from Lizzo, Steve Lacy and Brandi Carlile.. British artists had a good night, with indie duo Wet Leg winning two prizes, including best alternative album; and Sam Smith receiving best pop duo/group performance for Unholy, a duet with Kim Petras.. Smith's prize was their first Grammy since 2015, when they won four trophies, including best new artist.. However, the singer let Petras take the microphone to mark another historical achievement.. \"Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,\" said the German-born singer.. She went on to thank the late, transgender pop artist Sophie for \"kicking these doors open\", and Madonna \"for fighting for LGBTQ rights\", before dedicating the award to her mother.. \"I grew up next to nowhere in Germany and my mother believed me, that I was a girl,\" she said, as Smith looked on with pride. \"I wouldn't be here without her and her support.\". The duo later gave a sultry, BDSM-inspired performance of their ode to infidelity, introduced by Madonna.. \"If they call you shocking, scandalous, troublesome, problematic, provocative, or dangerous you're definitely onto something,\" said the star.. Adele also won best pop vocal performance for Easy On Me, dedicating the prize to her son Angelo.. The singer told the audience she had written the first verse \"in the shower when I was choosing to change my son's life\", by divorcing her then-husband, Simon Konecki.. She added: \"I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it's very old school and very brave.\". Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt was the surprise winner of song of the year - beating favourites Taylor Swift and Beyoncé with her sorrowful ballad Just Like That.. Voters were undoubtedly moved by Raitt's tender lyrics, in which a woman mourning the death of her son finds comfort from the man who received his heart in a transplant.. \"I'm so proud that you appreciate this one,\" said the 72-year-old, accepting her trophy.. Bad Bunny opened the show in an explosion of colour, replicating a Puerto Rican fiesta in the aisles of Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena.. His medley of El Apagón and Después De La Playa was enhanced with pyrotechnics, dozens of dancers and a troop of . the \"bighead\" puppets that march down the streets of San Juan every January.. He later won the prize for best Música Urbana album, in recognition of Un Verano Sin Ti, which spent 13 weeks at number one in the US last year.. \"I made this album with love and passion, and when you do things with love and passion, everything is easier,\" said the singer.. Other performances came from Americana star Brandi Carlile and Lizzo, who gave a gospel-infused take on her current single, Special.. She later won record of the year for About Damn Time, and used her speech to honour Prince, who gave her an early break on his song Boytrouble. . \"When we lost Prince, I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music.\" She also paid tribute to Beyoncé, calling her \"the artist of our lives\".. The in memoriam section gave an emotional send-off to stars like Olivia Newton-John, Irene Cara, David Crosby and Jeff Beck.. Kacey Musgraves played a heartfelt version of Coal Miner's Daughter in tribute to the \"Queen of Country\" Loretta Lynn; while Fleetwood Mac star Christine McVie was honoured with a performance of her signature hit, Songbird, by Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Fleetwood.. And Migos rapper Quavo played Without You - a song he wrote after the tragic death of his nephew and bandmate Takeoff last November. . In a more celebratory moment, the stage was taken over by more than two dozen rap icons, celebrating 50 years of hip-hop.. Turntable pioneer Grandmaster Flash kicked off the set with Flash Was On The Beat, cueing up an almost 12-minute trawl through the genre's greatest hits.. Run-DMC played Rock The Bells, Public Enemy delivered a verse of Yo, Bum Rush The Show, Missy Elliot swept in for Lose Control and Busta Rhymes gave a show-stopping performance of his high-velocity rap from Chris Brown's Look At Me Now..
