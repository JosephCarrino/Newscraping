        "content": "It comes after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and Canadian airspace before it was shot down by the US military. . China has also been recently accused of interfering with Canadian elections. . Monitoring buoys were discovered and retrieved last fall as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the country's security by surveilling air, land and sea domains.. A spokesperson for Canada's Department of National Defence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, said in a statement that the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches\". . Mr Le Bouthillier added that China does this using \"dual-purpose technologies\", meaning devices that conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes. . He said the military has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory since 2022, but did not elaborate on their nature.. China has long displayed interest in the Arctic. It has sent high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and participates in most major Arctic institutions. . It has also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north, often for research expeditions.. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate change, and gain access to emerging resources.. But experts say that China's research interests in the region have also doubled as attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.. Their efforts are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US, Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped potential in the region.. \"This is a part of the world that has not been mapped and understood to the same degree of detail as other latitudes,\" said Roberto Mazzolin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a former high-ranking official in the Canadian Armed Forces. . Mr Mazzolin said Canada has historically looked at the Arctic as a safe area with little potential for threat. But interest in the region by Russia, and more recently China, has changed that.. \"[Canada is forced to] look at how we would posture our own security, our military defence, or our economic development activities to secure Canadian and American interests,\" he said. . On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that she views China as an increasingly disruptive power. . Ms Joly added that Canada is working closely with the US to protect North American airspace, as well as Canada's Arctic sovereignty.. The Canadian military's discovery of the Chinese buoys comes at the heels of revelations by Canadian intelligence that China had tried to interfere in Canada's last federal election in 2021. . In documents first reported on by the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service outlined China's efforts to re-elect Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority of government, and to ensure the defeat of Conservative politicians who are seen as unfriendly to China.. It did so through cash donations to preferred candidates, the spread of disinformation and using consulates and paid students to help certain Liberal candidates, according to reporting by the Globe. . Canadian parliamentarians are in the midst of probing allegations that China interfered in Canada's 2019 federal election. On Tuesday, they expanded their scope to include the 2021 election as well. . On Wednesday, Prime Minister Trudeau called the suspected Chinese election interference \"an extraordinarily serious issue\", and said he supported a further probe into these reports. . He added the meddling efforts so far appear to have been unsuccessful, but still raise concern that foreign countries are trying to interfere with Canada's democratic processes. . \"Foreign actors are trying to undermine people's confidence in democracy itself,\" Mr Trudeau said.. Chinese officials in Canada have denied these reports, saying they do not interfere in Canadian election or internal affairs. Earlier this month, China's suspected surveillance efforts in North America dominated headlines after a Chinese balloon was discovered flying over North America.. Both the US and Canada said that the balloon was spying on sensitive military assets. China, however, has denied it was used for surveillance, instead saying it was a civilian weather balloon that had blown off course.. ",

        "content": "Beijing has maintained that the balloon was a weather ship blown off course.. But Washington says the balloon was part of a sprawling Chinese intelligence collection programme.. As the balloon flew over US territory, at least two planes gathered information on its features and trajectory.. A senior State Department official said earlier this month that fly-bys revealed it \"was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations\".. Officials first became aware of the balloon when it crossed into Alaskan airspace on 28 January.. Fighter jets belonging to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) - a joint operation between the US and Canada - identified the foreign object, but the military did not shoot it down at the time.. Officials explained they could not shoot the balloon down over land because its size and likely debris field posed a threat to civilians on the ground. . One defence official told US lawmakers earlier this month the balloon was as tall as the Statue of Liberty and had \"a jetliner-size payload\".. The image released on Wednesday was taken the day before the balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February. The photo has reportedly \"gained legendary status\" inside the Pentagon.. The balloon was said to be hovering at 60,000 feet (18,200m) in the air.. U-2 planes routinely fly at altitudes over 70,000 feet, according to the Air Force.. The single-seater reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, nicknamed the Dragon Lady, were previously flown by the CIA. Pilots are required to wear full pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts.. Recovery efforts for the balloon's scattered remnants in the Atlantic Ocean ended last Friday.. Pieces of the debris, including its payload, have been recovered and are being studied, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. ",

        "content": "Official figures published last month showed Japan's rate of inflation was at its highest level in over 40 years.. That has put pressure on businesses and authorities to help people as their spending power shrinks.. Each year Japanese firms typically hold pay talks with unions for weeks before announcing their decisions around the middle of March.. The car makers have not said why this year's announcements were made earlier than usual.. On Wednesday, Toyota said it will meet union demands for pay and bonuses, with wages increasing by the most in 20 years.. Toyota's incoming president Koji Sato said that he hoped the move would have a positive impact across the Japan's motor industry and \"lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company.\". The company declined to provide further details when approached by the BBC.. Meanwhile, rival car maker Honda told the BBC that it had \"fully answered\" union requests for wage increases and bonuses.. The company said it will raise salaries by 5%, marking the biggest increase since 1990 and above Japan's rate of inflation.. A Honda spokesperson said the extra money will largely be distributed to younger employees as starting salaries are boosted.. \"Despite the severe business environment, management has a strong desire to create an environment in which all employees can... push forward with their work with a sense of urgency,\" the spokesperson added.. Earlier this year, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida called on firms to raise wages to help people struggling with rising prices.. In January, the owner of fashion chain Uniqlo, Fast Retailing, said . . . The company said the new pay policy would apply to full-time employees at its headquarters and company stores in Japan from the beginning of March..
