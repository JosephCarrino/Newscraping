        "content": "\"Some want to go to Canada, some want to go to warmer states, and we are there for them as they continue to move on with their pursuit of this dream,\" Mr Adams said.. The New York Post has reported that migrants in New York City are being given free bus tickets to Plattsburgh, New York state, about 20 miles (32km) south of the Canadian border. From there, they pay taxis and shuttles to take them to Quebec. . Quebec immigration minister Christine Fréchette told reporters in Montreal that the development was \"surprising\".. She said it highlighted the need to \"solve the problem of Roxham Road\", referring to an unofficial border crossing south of Montreal used by thousands of asylum seekers every year.. \"I think it makes the urgency of the situation even more apparent,\" Ms Fréchette said, adding that Canada and the US were negotiating to update the Safe Third Country Agreement.. The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada. . But it only applies at official border crossings, which Roxham Road is not. This loophole allows the migrants arriving from New York to have their asylum cases heard by Canadian immigration authorities.. New York City has an ongoing migrant crisis, as states on the southern US border bus newly arrived migrants to America's most populous city.. In a January visit to Texas, Mayor Adams told reporters there was \"no room in New York\" for the migrants. . Days before, he had released a statement saying his city had welcomed 40,000 asylum seekers since last spring, providing them with food, shelter and other resources. . \"We are at our breaking point,\" the statement read. \"Based off our projections, we anticipate being unable to continue sheltering arriving asylum seekers on our own and have submitted an emergency mutual aid request to the State of New York.\". Mr Adams confirmed to Fox 5 on Monday that the city was providing free bus tickets for migrants.. \"If they are seeking to go somewhere else, we are helping in the reticketing process,\" he said..

Meta argued that the court had no jurisdiction because the company is not based in Kenya, Reuters reported.. But the court disagreed and found that Meta and Sama were \"proper parties\" to the case.. Meta declined to comment, but legal campaign group Foxglove expected it to appeal.. In 2020, Meta paid $52m to settle a case brought by US content moderators over mental health issues which they said they developed on the job.. The Kenyan case is supported by Foxglove, whose director Cori Crider said that a key point had been established: \"Daniel's win today should send a message to Facebook, and by proxy, all of big tech in Africa. . \"Kenyan justice is equal to any tech giant, and the giants would do well to wake up and respect Kenyan people - and their law.\". Facebook employs thousands of moderators to review content flagged by users or artificial intelligence systems to see if it violates the platform's community standards, and to remove it if necessary.. Mr Motaung said the first graphic video he saw was \"a live video of someone being beheaded\".. He told .  that he suffers flashbacks where he imagines he is the victim.. Mr Motaung, who says he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, believes that his co-workers also struggled with the content they had to view.. \"I would see people walking off the production floor to cry, you know, that type of thing,\" he said.. Mr Motaung was recruited from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi, where much of the moderation for East and South Africa was handled. . He claims the support given to moderators was inadequate.. Sama has called his accusations \"both disappointing and inaccurate\", arguing that it provided all members of its workforce with a competitive wage, benefits, upward mobility, and a robust mental health and wellness programme..  work for Meta. . Meta has previously declined to comment directly on the legal action, but has said it requires partners \"to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support\".. Campaigners say Monday's court ruling could have significance for other cases they are attempting to bring.. In December, a case, also backed by Foxglove, was launched in Kenya, alleging Facebook's algorithm helped fuel the viral spread of hate and violence during Ethiopia's civil war.. The case asks the court to require the creation of a $2bn fund for victims of hate on Facebook and changes to the platform's algorithm.. Meta said that hate speech and incitement to violence were against the platform's rules, and says it invests heavily in moderation and tech to remove such content.. It told the BBC: \"We employ staff with local knowledge and expertise and continue to develop our capabilities to catch violating content in the most widely spoken languages in the country, including Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya.\" .

        "content": "Turkey and Syria earthquake: Drone footage shows Turkey earthquake aftermath. More than 4,300 people were killed in Turkey and over the border in Syria when the quake struck in the early hours of Monday.. The World Health Organisation has warned the toll may rise dramatically as rescuers find more victims. . Many people in the disaster zone are too scared to return to buildings.. The 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 (01:17 GMT) on Monday at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep, according to the US Geological Survey. . Seismologists say it was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey, where at least 2,921 people are now known to have died. Survivors say it took two minutes for the shaking to stop.. A later tremor had a magnitude of 7.5, and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. . As the aftershocks continued, some rescuers dug through rubble with their bare hands looking for survivors. . In the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, pouring rain hampered rescuers as they searched through the rubble looking for any survivors.. The city was without power as the cold and rain set in.. One family camped on the street - despite the freezing temperatures - as they were scared of the aftershocks triggering another building to collapse.. Every time they felt an aftershock, the family moved closer into the middle of the street.. A hotel owner in the city told the BBC that of 14 guests staying that night only seven had been found.. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment.. But the earthquake has caused significant damage to three airports across Turkey, also creating challenges for aid deliveries.. At least 1,400 people are now known to have been killed in Syria where millions of refugees live in camps on the Turkish border. . British-born doctor Shajul Islam has worked in al-Shifa's hospital in Idlib, in northern Syria, for the past seven years. He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight programme that the carnage in the hospital was the worst had ever seen. . \"Our hospital is full. We have about 300-400 patients in the hospital right now... we literally have two to three patients per bed,\" he said. . He said he was caring for 40-45 critically ill patients in the ICU: \"I'm taking patients off ventilators to give them to other patients that might have more of a chance of surviving. We're literally at the entrance of the hospital deciding which patients we are going to try to save.\". Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support.. UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an international response, saying that many of the families hit by the disaster were \"already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge\". . The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. The UK has said it will send 76 specialists, equipment and rescue dogs.. France, Germany, Israel, and the US have also pledged to help.

        "content": "Emergency rescue teams said many buildings were damaged or destroyed and that people were trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,400 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . Some Aleppo residents told Reuters they have nowhere to go, either because their homes have been destroyed or because they are afraid of further quakes. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said families remained trapped under the rubble. . One man in the town of Jandairis told AFP news agency he had lost 12 members of his family in the earthquake. Another said some of his relatives were trapped under the rubble.. \"We hear their voices, they're still alive, but there's no way to get them out,\" he said. \" There's no one to rescue them. There's no machinery.\". In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region were beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . It may also take some time for international aid to arrive. North-western Syria has become one of the hardest places to reach, with only one small crossing on the Turkish border available to transport resources to opposition-held areas.. Shajul Islam has worked in the intensive care unit of al-Shifa Hospital in Idlib for the past seven years and told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 the current situation in the hospital was the worst he had ever seen.. There were two to three patients per bed, he said, and people were being taken off ventilators to give to others who have a better chance of surviving. . Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said that Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, may be forced to accept help from Western countries and neighbours he has often condemned for backing his enemies. . Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",
