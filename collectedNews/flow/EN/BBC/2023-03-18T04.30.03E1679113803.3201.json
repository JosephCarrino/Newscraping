        "content": "It says the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. . Moscow has denied the allegations and labelled the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move - the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and can only exercise jurisdiction within its member countries - and Russia is not one of them.. However it could affect the president in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally.. , the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. When asked about the ICC's move, US President Joe Biden said \"well, I think it's justified\". He noted that the US is not signed up to the ICC, \"but I think it makes a very strong point\". Mr Putin \"clearly committed war crimes\", he said.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. In the past, she has spoken openly of efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian children taken to Russia. . Last September, Ms Lvova-Belova complained that some children removed from the city of Mariupol \"spoke badly about the [Russian President], said awful things and sang the Ukrainian anthem.\". She has also claimed to have adopted a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol.. The ICC said it initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public in the event that it stopped further crimes from being committed.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told the BBC: \"children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported\".. \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be human being to know how egregious it is,\" he said.. Reactions to the warrants came within minutes of the announcement, with Kremlin officials instantly dismissing them.. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. \"No need to explain WHERE this paper should be used,\" he wrote on Twitter, with a toilet paper emoji.. However Russian opposition leaders welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Khan and the criminal court for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the decision was \"historic for Ukraine\", while the country's presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, lauded the decision as \"only the beginning\".. This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. But because Russia is not a signed member of the ICC, there is very little chance that Vladimir Putin or Maria Lvova-Belova will appear in the dock at The Hague. . The ICC relies on the cooperation of governments to arrest people, and Russia is \"obviously not going to cooperate in this respect\", Jonathan Leader Maynard, a lecturer in international politics at King's College London, told the BBC.. However Mr Khan pointed out that no-one thought . , the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, would end up in The Hague.. \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" he said.. Legally, however, this does present Mr Putin with a problem. . While he is the head of a G20 state, and about to . , Mr Putin is now also a wanted man, and this will inevitably place restrictions on which countries he can visit.. There is also a level of embarrassment for the Kremlin, which has always denied allegations of Russian war crimes, that such an influential, pan-national body as the ICC simply does not believe its denials..

        "content": "State officials said there was no immediate public health risk.. The leak was first discovered in late November, but state officials did not notify the public until Thursday.. The water contains tritium, a common by-product of nuclear plant operations.. A naturally occurring radioactive isotope of hydrogen, tritium emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far in air and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).. Tritium spills occur at nuclear plants on occasion, but are typically contained on-site and rarely affect public health or safety, the NRC says.. Xcel first discovered the leak on 21 November, from a pipe between two buildings at its Monticello plant. The plant is about 35 miles (56km) from the state's most populous city, Minneapolis, upstream along the Mississippi River.. The Minnesota Department of Health has said the leak did not reach the Mississippi River.. The company said it had notified the state and the NRC the next day.. \"If at any point there had been concern for the public safety, we would of course, immediately have provided more information. But we also wanted to make sure we fully understood what was going on before we started raising any concerns with the public around us,\" Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. . \"Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,\" the Minnesota-based utility said in a statement on Thursday.. State officials said they had waited to get more information before going public with the leak, but confirmed that the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.. On Friday, the mayor of Monticello defended the city's response, saying that city officials did not learn of the leak until \"the end of February\" and that the city does not have any authority over the power plant.. \"Though the Xcel plant is within our community, the City of Monticello does not have the authority to govern the nuclear plant,\" Mayor Lloyd Hilgart said in a statement saying that oversight is done by state and federal officials. . \"If state or federal oversight agencies determine that there is any potential or actual impact to the City's drinking water supply or infrastructure, the City will immediately notify the public with assistance from these agencies,\" he said.. Xcel Energy said crews inspected the plant at all points where leaks could occur and will be examining the leaked pipe in a lab. . Roughly one-quarter of the spilled tritium has been recovered so far, and Xcel has said it may build above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water.. It is also weighing how to treat, re-use or dispose of the collected tritium and water.. The company previously had a small leak at its Monticello plant in 2009.. ",

        "content": "For Maria Silvia and Francesca - and their four children Margherita, twins Giorgio and Raffaele, and Antonio - being finally recognised as a household after years of legal challenges and discrimination was \"truly incredible\".. This week, however, what was then seen as a major victory for equality and acceptance by the LGBT community was reversed.. Italy's right-wing government instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents, reigniting a debate around Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative agenda.. Families, activists and political opponents are to protest against the ban in Milan on Saturday.. Ms Meloni, who leads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, made anti-LGBT rhetoric a cornerstone of her electoral campaign, promising to protect traditional values. . \"We were always a family, but being officially recognised as such by our own mayor made us feel welcome,\" said Maria Silvia Fiengo. \"Today, looking at what the government is doing, and knowing that other families won't be able to have the same opportunity, we feel discouraged.\" . Italy legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 under a centre-left government.. However, stiff resistance from Catholic and conservative groups meant that the law stopped short of granting adoption rights to same-sex couples as well. Opponents said it would encourage surrogate pregnancies, which are still illegal in Italy. . That left a regulatory vacuum surrounding several aspects of LGBT family life, including adoption. Solutions aimed at getting around bureaucratic hurdles were reached on a case-by-case basis, as cases went to court.. Some local administrators, including the centre-left mayor of Milan, decided that children of same-sex couples would be registered independently.  . Mr Sala has now announced he has been forced to halt the practice after he was sent a letter by the interior ministry. It cited a ruling by Italy's highest court requiring court approval for legal recognition of parental status. . \"It is a clear step backwards, politically and socially, and I put myself in the shoes of those parents who thought they could count on this possibility in Milan,\" said the mayor in his daily podcast Buongiorno Milano, adding that he was left with no other choice.. Children who are denied the right to have both parents recognised on their birth certificate are left in a legal limbo.. Their families face a range of challenges, from adoption and parenting to inheritance. In the most extreme scenario, if the legally recognised parent were to pass away, the children could become wards of the state and face the prospect of being orphaned. . In Italy's LGBT community, this has led to a growing sense of frustration and anxiety, while the Meloni government's hostile approach to LGBT rights has further exacerbated the issue.. \"Children end up having limited access to key services and benefits, such as healthcare, inheritance and child support,\" said Angelo Schillaci, law professor at Sapienza University in Rome. . \"At present, only one parent is recognised by law, the other one is a ghost. In real life, parents and children play together, cook together, play sports and go on holiday together. But on paper, they are apart, the state does not see them. It's a paradoxical situation.\" . The prime minister, elected last September, has been a vocal supporter of traditional family and Christian values, campaigning against what she calls \"gender ideology\" and the \"LGBT lobby\". Months before she came to power, she proposed a law that would make surrogacy by an Italian citizen a universal crime, and it is still on her party's agenda. . \"Boys and girls with two mothers and two fathers already exist in Italy, Prime Minister Meloni should get over it,\" said Alessia Crocini, president of the Rainbow Families association. \"We must guarantee our children the same rights as their peers.\" . \"We feel under attack,\" said Angela Diomede, who will take part in the Milan rally with her wife and their six-year-old girl. \"I don't understand this obsession of the government with targeting children, it doesn't lead anywhere.\" . Italy's Senate this week also rejected a proposal for a standardised European parenthood certificate that would be recognised across all 27 member states of the EU.. For children, it would mean proof of parenthood and for parents it would be a guaranteed right to be recognised across the EU, protecting rights such as inheritance and citizenship. . But for Italy's far-right infrastructure minister, Matteo Salvini, it was a step too far. \"A person can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual: love is free, beautiful and sacred for all,\" he tweeted.. Riccardo Magi, an opposition MP in favour of the Europe-wide certificate, complained: \"The world goes one way, the [Italian] government goes the other.\" . The debate is being followed closely from the north-eastern city of Udine by Stefano Zucchini and his husband Alberto.. They have two six-year-old twins, who were born in California through surrogacy, and hope to be legally recognised as a family one day. In the US, they are both recognised as parents. But in Italy, Stefano is listed as a single father, and that legal status makes life complicated.. \"Even things that are normal for most people, such as driving the kids to the kindergarten or to a doctor appointment, can become a challenge,\" he told the BBC.. \"They don't see us, but our love is as strong as ever. That, for sure, exists.\". ",

Police were called to the actor's house around 09:30 local time (16:30 GMT), the publicist told US media. . \"Lance will be greatly missed,\" his publicist, Mia Hansen, said in a statement. \"Please respect his family's privacy at this time.\".

The actor is survived by his wife, Stephanie, as well as a daughter, Yvonne Nicole Reddick, and a son, Christopher Reddick.. Reddick told the Los Angeles Times in 2009 that he felt like an \"artist at heart\". . \"When I went to drama school, I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a black man and I wasn't pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be,\" he said at the time. . His death comes two years after Reddick's co-star Michael K Williams, who played Omar in The Wire, died of an overdose. Last year, four people were charged for allegedly selling the drugs that Williams took before his death. . ",
