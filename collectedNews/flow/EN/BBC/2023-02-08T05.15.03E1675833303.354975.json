        "content": "The post said the sailors retrieving the debris on Sunday were part of the Navy's specialist explosives team.. The device will now be examined to see whether it was indeed spy equipment.. US officials have described the balloon as being about 200 ft (60m) tall, with the payload portion comparable in size to regional airliners and weighing hundreds - or potentially thousands - of pounds. . China has repeatedly insisted that the \"airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident\".. On Tuesday, US officials said the Pentagon sought to arrange a phone call between Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart after the balloon was shot down, but was rebuffed by China. . \"Lines between our militaries are particularly important in moments like this,\" defence press secretary Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the PRC has declined our request.\". The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off a weekend trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years - over the \"irresponsible act\". . The balloon was retrieved off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a day after being shot down by a fighter jet.. The navy said the debris was spread over seven miles (11km) of the Atlantic Ocean, and two naval ships - including one with a heavy crane for recovery - were sent to the area. However, the photos reveal the piles of balloon material were able to be pulled aboard by hand.. The US military has also deployed unmanned underwater vehicles as part of the search effort. . Experts say that the wreckage of the balloon could provide the US with valuable insight into Chinese aerial surveillance technology and techniques, allowing them to better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information. . Efforts to recover the balloon's equipment, however, have been complicated by the need to ensure that US personnel are kept safe from potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components. . US defence officials first announced they were tracking the strange object on Thursday, and waited until it was safely over water before shooting it down.. Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon . .. On Friday, the Pentagon said a .  - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. Colombia's Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. ",

        "content": "Dramatic footage showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris in Jindayris.. A doctor at a hospital in nearby Afrin said she was now in a stable condition. . The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border.. The baby's uncle, Khalil al-Suwadi, said relatives had rushed to the scene when they learned of the collapse.. \"We heard a voice while we were digging,\" he told AFP news agency on Tuesday. \"We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord [intact], so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.\". Paediatrician Hani Maarouf said the baby had arrived at his hospital in a bad condition, with \"several bruises and lacerations over all her body\".. \"She also arrived with hypothermia because of the harsh cold. We had to warm her up and administer calcium,\" he added. . She was photographed lying in an incubator and connected to a drip, as a joint funeral was held for her mother Afraa, father Abdullah and her four siblings.. They are among 1,800 people known to have been killed by the earthquake in Syria, according to the Damascus-based government and the White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders operate in opposition-held areas. . Another 4,500 people have been killed in Turkey, where the epicentre was.  . The White Helmets have so far reported 1,020 deaths, but they have warned that figure is expected to \"rise dramatically\".. \"Time is running out. Hundreds still trapped under the rubble. Every second could mean saving a life,\" they tweeted on Tuesday. . \"We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and international bodies to provide material support and assistance to organisations responding to this disaster.\". The UN has vowed to use \"any and all means\" possible to get aid to people in the north-west, but it has said that deliveries have been halted temporarily due to damaged roads and other logistical issues.. It has also urged governments not to politicise aid delivery when so many are in desperate need. . A UN Security Council agreement authorises the use of just one border crossing for deliveries from Turkey into the north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of \"cross-line\" aid.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people in the north-west - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian aid to survive.. ",
