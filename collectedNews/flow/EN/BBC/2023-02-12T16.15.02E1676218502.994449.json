        "content": "While he didn't say specifically that the latest objects were Chinese, Mr Schumer told ABC on Sunday that Beijing was likely using a \"crew of balloons\" that had \"probably been all over the world\".. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that the latest object was shot down on Saturday over the Yukon in north-west Canada.. Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track down the object, which Mr Trudeau said \"violated Canadian airspace\" and was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.. Mr Trudeau confirmed on Saturday he gave the order and had spoken with US President Joe Biden.. \"Canadian forces will now recover and analyse the wreckage of the object,\" he wrote on Twitter.. Three objects have been shot down over North America in total in the last week. . The American military destroyed a Chinese balloon last weekend, and on Friday an object the size of a small car was shot down off Alaska. . China has denied the balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. The latest object was flying over central Yukon at about 40,000 ft (12,000m) and intercepted at about 15:41 local time on Saturday, defence minister Anita Anand told reporters.. She described it as \"small\" and \"cylindrical\", but that recovery efforts are still being carried out to discover more details.. Ms Anand said it was taken out \"about 100 miles\" from the US border, adding it posed a \"reasonable threat to civil aviation\".. She said it \"appears to be smaller than the one shot down off the coast of South Carolina\" .  - meaning the giant Chinese suspected spy balloon that measured 200ft (60m) tall.. Posting earlier on Twitter, Prime Minister Trudeau thanked the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) which carries out air defence for the US and Canada and led the mission.. The White House said the object had been tracked and monitored \"over the last 24 hours\".. \"Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,\" it said. . \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\". Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.. Pentagon Press Secretary Brig Gen Pat Ryder added that the FBI will be \"working closely\" with Canadian police.. Separately on Saturday, the US military also scrambled fighter jets over Montana as some airspace was closed - but it turned out to be a \"radar anomaly\" and nothing unusual was found.. In a short statement, the military said US troops, including from the Alaska National Guard, were still conducting search and recovery activities on sea ice for Friday's object.. It said at the time that it had no further details about the object's capabilities, purpose or origin but confirmed the FBI is helping with the recovery near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse.. \"Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,\" it added - and that the rescue operation will continue as weather permits.. Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. China has denied the balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. The US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\".. In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the Chinese balloon, maintaining that it was not \"a major breach\".. ",

The increase comes as Ukrainian officials say that Russia has launched a \"big offensive\".. However, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC), Oleksiy Danilov, also said Russia is experiencing \"big problems\" with the campaign. . \"Our troops are repulsing [the offensive] very strongly,\" Mr Danilov said. \"The offensive they planned is already taking place, gradually, but it's not the offensive they imagined.\". Last week, Ukraine's outgoing defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said they were anticipating a new Russian offensive .  - the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. . Some of the fiercest fighting has been around Bakhmut in the east of the country.. On Sunday, the head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said the group had seized a settlement near the devastated city.. Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Telegram: \"Today, the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by assault detachments of the Wagner PMC.\" . Mr Prigozhin also gave his group credit for the offensive on Bakhmut, downplaying the Russian army's role: \"Within a radius of 50 km, plus or minus, there are only Wagner PMC fighters,\" he wrote. . The statement hints at longstanding tensions between the Russian military and Wagner. . When the town of Soledar was taken in January, Mr Prigozhin claimed his fighters were in full control there boasted that only his troops took part - . .. Bakhmut's strategic importance has been questioned, but the prolonged fighting has turned it into a symbolic prize.. According to the Ukrainian data, highlighted by the UK, 824 Russian losses a day is more than four times the rate reported in June and July, when around 172 Russian soldiers died each day. . The Ukrainian military claims .  since the full-scale invasion began.. The UK's MoD pointed out the recent increase could be due to \"a range of factors, including lack of trained personnel, coordination, and resources across the front\". . Ukraine \"also continues to suffer a high attrition rate\", the UK said.. Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the .

Northland declared a state of emergency then too over fears of unprecedented rain, but those concerns proved to be unfounded.. This time, however, gale force winds and heavy rain has been reported, leaving thousands of people without power. They have been warned that it may take days for power to be restored. . \"This is a serious event for New Zealand,\" meteorologist Georgina Griffiths told Radio New Zealand. . People who knew their homes were flood-prone were advised to evacuate ahead of the storm's arrival. . Declaring a state of emergency gives local authorities greater power to respond to dangerous situations and allows them to restrict travel and provide aid.. Further south in the country's largest city, Auckland, authorities issued a red weather alert - meaning severe gales, flooding and land slips are possible. . Schools have once again been advised to move learning online and emergency shelters have been set up in preparation for the storm. Trains have been cancelled and the Harbour Bridge, an important transport link, has been temporarily closed.. Air New Zealand, the country's national carrier, has announced it would cancel multiple long-haul international fights, Tasman and Pacific Island flights, and domestic services in and out of Auckland planned for Monday, when the worst of the bad weather is expected. . Thousands of homes suffered damage in January's record-breaking rainfall, which caused severe flooding and landslides, and four people died.. Residents are on high alert as they have been warned that the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure from the recent deluge could mean parts of the city will flood again more easily.. They have been using sandbags to try and people protect their houses and long queues have been forming at supermarkets after the authorities advised people to have enough supplies to last at least three days in case the situation deteriorated. . \"The water was knee-deep,\" one man who was filling up sandbags and a public facility told Television New Zealand. \"You never know what`s going to happen in the next two days.\". \"We had the creak behind us burst its banks, and it was pretty much against our back fence,\" said another. . New Zealand's prime minister, Chris Hipkins, has asked people to take the severe weather warnings seriously and to make sure they are prepared. . \"Central and local government have been working very closely to prepare for this event and also to make sure the early lessons that can be captured from our response a week or two back can be incorporated into this one.\". Thousands of people are already reported to be without power on the Coromandel Peninsula - where major roads connecting the mainly rural communities have been closed or are under warnings. . Residents in vulnerable areas there and in Tairāwhiti have also been urged to seriously consider evacuating.. The latter region, which lies New Zealand's east coast, is especially prone to flooding. . Instances where residents in small towns and settlements have had to band together to protect each other and their properties have become more common in recent years. . This video can not be played. Storm Gabrielle hits New Zealand. The tiny Australian territory of Norfolk Island, which lies north of New Zealand, had a lucky escape after the storm's most destructive winds bypassed it. . Norfolk Island's emergency controller, George Plant, told ABC News there were some emergency calls but that an initial assessment suggests the damage was \"manageable\". . \"We're feeling very fortunate as a community that we didn't cop the full brunt of what Gabrielle had to offer,\" resident Hannah Taylor said. . \"If she had moved a few a little bit south, we would have seen a lot more damage.\".

More arrests are expected - but the action will be seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. .

On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province.

The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. . Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. .
