        "content": "He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels.. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move.. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives.. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing.. The chief of Mr Zelensky's presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, said cryptically that the question of long-range weaponry and fighter jets had been resolved. Mr Zelensky said only that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public.. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had. . Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act \"within the entire formation of Nato\", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly.. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years.. \"Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,\" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the \"biggest anti-European force of the modern world\". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine.. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table.. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be \"game-changers\" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, \"the quicker this Russian aggression will end\", he explained.. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not.. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France \"determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights\". Chancellor Scholz added: \"The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war.\". Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results.. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was \"very little time\" to provide much-needed weaponry.. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. \"The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,\" Mr Rutte told the BBC.. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls \"provocations\".  . Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict.. \"We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,\" said Mr Peskov.. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a \"public bidding war\" of weapons systems for Ukraine.. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: \"Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.\" . Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was \"a long-term solution\" and that training pilots could take years..

        "content": "But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions - breaking policies set out by SpaceX.. A Ukrainian official said companies had to choose which \"side\" they were on.. They could join Ukraine and \"the right to freedom\", or pick Russia and \"its 'right' to kill and seize territories\", tweeted presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.. At an event in Washington DC on Wednesday, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell explained that Starlink technology was \"never meant to be weaponised\".. She made reference to Ukraine's alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use.. Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow's own drone attacks.. Russia has been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.. Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology \"for comms\", but said her intent was \"never to have them use it for offensive purposes\".. She said the company had taken steps to \"limit\" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details. . The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year. . After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media.. The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected.. They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit.. As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments.. In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position.. In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work. . \"SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,\" he wrote. . \"However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don't part.\" . ",

        "content": "Thousands of illegal gold miners have invaded the indigenous reserve on Brazil's border with Venezuela.. The raid is part of a larger policy to halt the advance of illegal mining.. It is a joint operation by Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, the indigenous affairs department, Funai, and special forces tasked with protecting the environment.  . With an estimated 20,000 illegal miners dispersed throughout the dense jungle region, officials said the aim of the raids was to interrupt the flow of supplies rather than to target individual settlements. . The miners and their illegal activities are a grave threat to the Yanomami indigenous group, which is estimated to have 28,000 members.. Diseases, violence and environmental damages caused by the influx have triggered a humanitarian crisis among the Yanomami, resulting in the deaths from preventable diseases and hunger of scores of Yanomami children. . Two weeks ago. the government airlifted 16 members of the group out of the jungle to treat them for malnutrition. . Federal police last month launched an investigation to determine if the previous government of President Jair Bolsonaro could face charges of \"genocide\" after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office on 1 January, said that its treatment of the Yanomami was \"a premeditated crime\".. Ex-President Bolsonaro actively encouraged economic development in the Amazon region. Violence there increased during his four years in power, with illegal miners opening fire on indigenous communities.. Since the new government started taking action, some illegal miners have been seen leaving the Yanomami lands. . Marcio Astrini of the Climate Observatory, a network of 72 climate NGOs, said it was key to find alternative employment opportunities for the miners, many of whom are very poor. . He told the G1 news site: \"If nothing is done, if these people don't have alternative incomes. they will end up coming back to the areas from which they have been expelled, or they will invade mew ones.\". Justice Minister Flávio Dino said the federal government was working on a plan to support them. . ",

        "content": "Along with lyricist Hal David, he also wrote numerous movie themes including What's New, Pussycat, Alfie, and The Look Of Love, a major hit for Dusty Springfield.. Bacharach died on Wednesday at home in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Tina Brausam said.. Known for his airborne melodies and sumptuous orchestral arrangements, Bacharach was one of the most important songwriters of the 20th Century.. Over his career, he scored 73 Top 40 hits in the US and 52 in the UK, working with artists including Dionne Warwick, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Barbara Streisand, Tom Jones, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello.. Bacharach's music touched multiple genres, from cool jazz and rhythm and blues, to bossa nova and traditional pop - but they shared one thing in common: you could recognise them within a couple of notes.. It was a style inspired by his tutor, French jazz musician Darius Milhaud. . \"His observation was: Never be ashamed of something that's melodic, one could whistle,\" Bacharach recalled, having met the composer while studying at California's Music Academy of the West in the 1940s.. \"So that was a valuable lesson I learned from him. Never forgot that one. Never be afraid of something that you can whistle.\". Born in Missouri, Bacharach grew up in New York City, where he first studied cello, drums and piano as a child. . Enraptured by jazz and be-bop, he would often sneak out to watch sets by his heroes Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and began playing in jazz bands of his own in the 1940s.. After graduating from school, he studied music theory and composition. Even when his education was interrupted by a spell in the military, he toured army bases as a uniformed concert pianist.. After returning home, he toured with Marlene Dietrich, becoming her personal conductor - but said his early success was all down to luck.. \"I wasn't chasing it. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was caught in the drift of things,\" he later reflected. \"I'm not a person who will walk over people, kill people, step on people to get to the next place where they want to be. Things just happened for me. I was very fortunate.\". In the 1950s, he was hired to work in New York's Brill Building, an epicentre of the music industry, and started writing country-rock smashes like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Only Love Can Break A Heart for Gene Pitney.. He scored his first UK number one in 1957 with Michael Holliday's sweet-but-charming The Story of My Life - a song that was originally recorded by Marty Robbins in the US.. That song also happened to be his first collaboration with Hal David, with whom he forged one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the '60s.. Their sophisticated, debonair pop was often at odds with the more raucous sounds of rock 'n' roll, but the hits kept coming - especially when they teamed up with Dionne Warwick. . Over a period of 10 years, the trio enjoyed 39 consecutive US hits, including such memorable songs as Walk On By, Don't Make Me Over, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and Promises, Promises.. Warwick later sued Bacharach after he and David stopped working together, leaving her without new material to record. . It was a \"very costly and unfortunate\" dispute, Bacharach told the Guardian in 2019, adding: \"I stupidly handled it wrong.\". He and Warwick reconciled for the 1985 charity single That's What Friends Are For, which raised $1.5m for the American Foundation for Aids Research (AmFar) - and also featured vocals from Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight.. Outside of that partnership, Bacharach and David won a Grammy and an Oscar in 1969 for Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, performed by BJ Thomas and featured in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.. Bacharach's music for the film also won the Oscar for best original score.. Although his hits tailed off in later years, Bacharach remained a popular figure, collaborating with Adele, Sheryl Crow and Dr Dre, among others.. He also made a memorable appearance in the first Austin Powers film, performing I'll Never Fall in Love Again with Elvis Costello.. In 2016, he wrote the score for John Asher's indie drama Po, saying he identified with the story, which explores the impact of autism on children. . Bacharach's daughter Nikki had died of suicide in 2007, at the age of 40, after a lifelong struggle with Asperger's syndrome.   . The musician was married four times, to Paula Stewart in 1953, actress Angie Dickinson in 1958, his frequent musical collaborator Carole Bayer Sager in 1982, and finally Jane Hansen in 1993.. He is survived by Hansen and their children Oliver and Raleigh, as well as son Cristopher from his marriage to Bayer Sager.. ",
