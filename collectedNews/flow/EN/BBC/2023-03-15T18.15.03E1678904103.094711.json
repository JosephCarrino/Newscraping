        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large MQ-9 Reaper drone . The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller - but Moscow has denied these claims.. Speaking on state television, Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev confirmed Moscow was attempting to find the aircraft.. \"I don't know whether we'll be able to retrieve it or not but it has to be done. And we will certainly work on it,\" Mr Patrushev said.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US also wanted to locate the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. Speaking to ABC America's morning news program, Good Morning America, he added that there were logistical challenges as it crashed in \"very deep water\".. US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", the US said in a statement on Tuesday. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . Ukraine's foreign minister told the BBC incidents such as the downing of a US drone over the Black Sea are inevitable until Russia leaves Crimea.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Dmytro Kuleba said: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place. . \"So the only way to prevent such incidents is actually to kick Russia out of Crimea.\". Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the vast majority of countries still recognise it as part of Ukraine. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. He told the Ukraine contact group: \"It is incumbent upon Russia to operate its aircraft in a safe and professional manner.\". After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",

        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Later on Wednesday, the Lahore High Court ordered police to postpone the arrest of Mr Khan until Thursday, pending the result of a hearing on the legitimacy of the arrest warrant.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. On Wednesday, the streets outside Mr Khan's home were littered with debris and smouldering barricades.. His supporters gathered at one of the roads - a major highway in Lahore - and chanted his name.. Hours earlier, officers in riot gear had fired tear gas and water cannon in an effort to disperse hundreds of supporters at the compound. Some in the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. \"I have never witnessed such brutality, that's what shocks me,\" Waqar Khan, a PTI supporter told the BBC.. Recalling Tuesday's clashes, one woman, Tazeen, said: \"Are we not humans? What kind of a country is this? People around me could not breathe,\" one woman, Tazeen, said.. Mr Khan has said he did not appear in court because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . He earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. ",

        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis. Mr DeSantis is widely expected to run for president in 2024 and made his remarks in response to questions sent to possible Republican contenders. . The former congressman said continued US support of Ukraine was not among the country's \"vital national interests\".. The comment signalled he would probably scale back aid if he became president.. It also aligned Mr DeSantis with former President Donald Trump, the leading contender for the Republican nomination, who has opposed US support for Kyiv and criticised the Biden administration's handling of the war.. Their comments show the divide in the Republican Party between isolationists who are sceptical of providing military aid and the establishment party policy of supporting Kyiv.. In his response to a questionnaire by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, Mr DeSantis said: \"While the US has many vital national interests... becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\". The 44-year-old has not officially announced his intention to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican nomination, but has been taking all the necessary steps suggesting he will do so.. When asked the same question on whether US backing for Kyiv was vital for Washington, Mr Trump said: \"No, it is for Europe. But not for the United States.\". Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko criticised Mr DeSantis's comments and tweeted his invitation to the Republican governor on Tuesday.. \"We are sure that as a former military officer deployed to a combat zone, Governor Ron DeSantis knows the difference between a 'dispute' and war,\" Mr Nikolenko said.. \"We invite him to visit Ukraine to get a deeper understanding of Russia's full-scale invasion and the threats it poses to US interests.\". While studying law at Harvard University, Mr DeSantis was commissioned as an officer in the US Navy and was assigned to its legal arm, the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps. . His service as a JAG officer included working with detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, as well as an assignment as a legal adviser for elite US Navy Seals deployed to Iraq.. Many Republicans, including the party's senior leadership in the Senate, have long said defending Ukraine is in the best interests of the US. . South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr DeSantis' comments displayed \"a misunderstanding of the situation\" on the part of the governor. . \"This is not a territorial conflict, it's a war of aggression. To say it doesn't matter is to say war crimes don't matter,\" Mr Graham said.. Former Vice-President Mike Pence has also called for the US to increase its support.. But there is a vocal wing of the party - mostly in the House of Representatives - that is hesitant about the continuing aid.. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has supported Ukraine, but recently warned that there \"can't be a blank cheque\" for the country given the scale of US debt.. Politicians from both parties in Congress have voted in favour of Western support for Ukraine, approving more than $112bn (£92.47bn) in 2022 alone.. The US is the largest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent. It pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems, as well as training, logistics and intelligence support. . Humanitarian aid has included food assistance, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other necessities for Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. Financial aid keeps Ukraine's government operating by paying civil servants, healthcare workers and teachers.. ",

        "content": "Argentina has been in economic difficulty for years, and many people now live in poverty.. Its government has been trying to stem price rises by capping the prices of food and other products. . But the food and drink sectors saw the most dramatic increase recent, with prices growing by 9.8% in February compared to January.. Argentinian media said that this increase could partly be due to a sharp hike in the price of meat, which rose by almost 20% in the space of a month. Adverse weather conditions, a prolonged heatwave and a drought seriously impacted livestock and crops, said local news outlet Ambito.. Although the symbolism of the inflation rate shooting up past 100% is striking, the effects of soaring inflation have long been felt in Argentina. . Last September, protesters took to the streets to demand action to counter rising costs of living, and, in February, Argentina's central bank said that.  in response to the jump in consumer prices.. The Argentinian government has long tried to contain inflation, but divisions have marred the country's economic policy. . Last summer, three economy ministers succeeded one another in the space of four weeks as the country's economic crisis deepened, and President Alberto Fernández is said to be at odds with his deputy, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, over how to tackle Argentina's economic problems. . In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. ",

The UAE denied that conditions were poor and said it was working with the US to finish the resettlement process.. More than 10,000 other Afghans who were flown to the UAE have reportedly been resettled in the US, Canada and elsewhere, while a further 70,000 were evacuated directly to the US before American troops left Kabul.. The Afghans flown to Abu Dhabi following the Taliban takeover were housed in two converted apartment complexes known as Emirates Humanitarian City and Tasameem Workers City.. , including eight who had previously worked at some point for US government-affiliated entities or programmes in Afghanistan. . They reported constraints on their freedom of movement, lack of access to fair and effective refugee status determination, lack of adequate access to legal counsel, inadequate education for children, and no psychosocial support.. The detainees also described overcrowding, decaying infrastructure and insect infestations, according to the US-based campaign group.. One unnamed Afghan was quoted as saying that Emirates Humanitarian City was \"exactly like a prison\", while another described a \"widespread mental health crisis among residents\".. Under international law and UN Refugee Agency guidance, asylum seekers and migrants should not be detained for administrative purposes unless it is necessary and proportional to achieve a legitimate aim, and only in the absence of viable alternatives.. HRW called on the UAE to release the detainees and provide access to fair and efficient processes for determining their status and protection needs.. \"Governments should not ignore the shocking plight of these Afghans stranded in limbo in the UAE,\" said Joey Shea, the group's UAE researcher. . \"The US government in particular, which co-ordinated the 2021 evacuations and with whom many evacuees worked before the Taliban takeover, should immediately step up and intervene to provide support and protection for these asylum seekers.\". An Emirati official told AFP news agency that the UAE was providing \"high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counselling, education and food services\" for the Afghans at Emirates Humanitarian City.. They also said the UAE was continuing to work with US authorities to \"resettle the remaining evacuees in a timely manner\".. \"We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete,\" they added.. The US state department said there was an \"enduring\" US commitment to resettle all eligible Afghans, including those at Emirates Humanitarian City.. ",
