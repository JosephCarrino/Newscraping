        "content": "But Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has complained of a lack of ammunition, saying it could be \"ordinary bureaucracy or a betrayal\".. Relations between Wagner and Moscow seem increasingly tense.. The Wagner group has tens of thousands of troops in Ukraine - .  - and has become a key part of Moscow's invasion.. In a post on Sunday, Mr Prigozhin said documents had been signed on 22 February, with ammunition expected to be sent to Bakhmut the next day.. But most had not been shipped, he said, before suggesting it could be deliberate.. And in a further sign of the rift, on Monday Mr Prigozhin said his representative was unable to access the headquarters of Russia's military command. It is unclear where the headquarters is located. . Mr Prigozhin said it came after he wrote to the chief of Russia's \"special military operation\", Army General Valery Gerasimov, about the \"urgent necessity to give us ammunition\".. Separately, in a video uploaded on Saturday - but seemingly filmed in February - Mr Prigozhin said his men feared that they were being \"set up\" as scapegoats in case Russia lost its war in Ukraine. . \"If we step back, we will go down in history as the people who took the main step to lose the war,\" he said.. \"And this is precisely the problem with the shell hunger [ammunition shortage]. This is not my opinion, but that of ordinary fighters... . \"What if they [the Russian authorities] want to set us up, saying that we are scoundrels - and that's why they are not giving us ammunition, not giving us weapons, and not letting us replenish our personnel, including [recruiting] prisoners?\". In Saturday's video, Mr Prigozhin said Russia's front line would collapse without his troops.. \"If Wagner PMC [private military company] were to now retreat from Bakhmut, then the entire front - which PMC Wagner today is cementing - would crumble.\". He suggested Wagner fighters were taking on the \"entire Ukrainian army ... destroying it\" and depriving it of the chance to concentrate on other parts of the front.. While the private army was \"moving forward\", the Russian military was being forced to \"catch up in order to save face\", he implied.. Last month, Mr Prigozhin complained that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov were withholding supplies of munitions to his troops. . Ukraine's troops were probably conducting a \"limited fighting withdrawal\" in eastern Bakhmut, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday. . But it added Ukraine was .  on Russian forces.. The ISW said the Russian military relied on Wagner in the months-long effort to seize Bakhmut and had since \"reinforced Wagner forces in Bakhmut with Russian airborne elements and mobilized personnel\". . On Saturday, the deputy mayor of Bakhmut told the BBC that there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.. However Oleksandr Marchenko said Russian troops had not yet gained control.. \"They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,\" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.. Meanwhile, Ukrainian military officials said leaders of Russia's 155th Brigade fighting near the town of Vuhledar, south of Bakhmut, had resisted orders to attack after sustaining severe losses.. The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had hit a command centre of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment in southeastern Zaporizhzhia region. . Separately, Moscow's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has visited the occupied city of Mariupol during a trip to eastern Ukraine - a year after his troops besieged the city. . The defence ministry said he was inspecting work carried out to \"restore infrastructure in the Donbas\" - words that are likely to grate in Ukraine, given Russia's responsibility for the destruction..

        "content": "Officials on both sides hailed the proposal as a breakthrough on Monday.. But Korean victims have criticised the plan, saying it does not hold Japan accountable.. About 150,000 Koreans were forced to work in factories and mines in Japan in the war, due to Japan's colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945.. On Monday, protesters in Seoul held demonstrations outside South Korea's foreign ministry to condemn the plan by their government, which will see South Korean companies pay into a public fund for victims.. Meanwhile, Japan's government welcomed South Korea's move away from demanding two Japanese firms pay compensation.. Previous South Korean governments had attempted to make Tokyo pay reparations..  But the companies - among them Mitsubishi and Nippon Steel - refused, sparking further animosity.. However South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol, elected last year, has aimed to mend relations with Japan - another US ally in the region. The US has pressed both nations to improve their relations. . US President Joe Biden called the deal \"ground breaking\" on Monday. South Korea's foreign minister Park Jin told reporters: \"If we compare it to a glass of water, I think that the glass is more than half full.\". Japan's foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi also welcomed the plan, saying the Japanese government would allow domestic firms to join the public fund. He also expressed hope that political and cultural exchanges between the neighbouring countries would expand.. The deal should allow both nations to overcome a huge obstacle in their relationship - and thereby co-operate more closely on security, at a time when mutual threats posed by North Korea and China are increasing. . Seoul's plan proposes that South Korean companies who benefitted from a 1965 post-war treaty will pay donations. The fund of $3m (£2.5m) will be distributed among 15 families.. Since 1945, there have been a series of long-standing bilateral disputes. Tokyo maintains that the 1965 treaty, which included a reparations package of about $800 million in grants and cheap loans, settled all claims relating to the colonial period. However Seoul has long disputed this.. There was also the issue of compensation for . .. In 2015, a deal was penned to resolve the comfort women issue with a Japanese apology and the formation of a billion-yen fund for survivors.. However a bitter diplomatic row ensued three years later when Seoul dissolved the fund on the grounds that it did not to do enough to consider victims' concerns.. ",

        "content": "The group, which has five seats in Iraq's parliament, filed a lawsuit saying it was undemocratic.. Public alcohol consumption is frowned upon in Iraq, a predominantly Muslim country, but it can be bought at liquor stores or licensed bars.. The law, . , imposes a fine of up to 25m Iraqi dinars (£14,256). . It prohibits the sale, import or production of alcohol - and only became official last month, seven years since it was passed, after appearing in the official gazette.. It remains unclear how strictly the law could be enforced, and whether the country's Federal Supreme Court will knock it back.. In their appeal to the court, members of the Babylon Movement insisted the legislation was unconstitutional because it ignores the rights of minorities and restricts freedom.. It also contradicts a government decree, adopted less than a week before the gazette was published on 20 February, setting duty at 200% on all imported alcoholic drinks for the next four years, they say.. Sarmad Abbas, an estate agent based in Iraq's capital Baghdad, told the AFP news agency that the ban would merely push alcohol sales onto the black market.. He acknowledged that Muslim teachings forbid the consumption of alcohol. \"But these are personal freedoms that you cannot forbid citizens from practising,\" he said.. According to reports at the time, the bill was originally proposed by Mahmoud al-Hassan, then a judge and lawmaker for Iraq's State of Law Coalition.. He said it was in keeping with Article 2 of . , which prohibits any legislation that goes against Islam, the AP news agency wrote.. ",

        "content": "It mentioned a shovel known as MPL-50.. The tool was designed in 1869 and had changed little, the ministry said.. It has been part of the Russian reservist army kit for decades.. \"The lethality of the standard-issue MPL-50 entrenching tool is particularly mythologised in Russia,\" the ministry said.. The continued use of the shovel \"as a weapon highlights the brutal and low-tech fighting which has come to characterise much of the war\", it said.. One of the reservists described being \"neither physically nor psychologically\" prepared for the action, the update added.. \"Recent evidence suggests an increase in close combat in Ukraine,\" it said. . \"This is probably a result of the Russian command continuing to insist on offensive action largely consisting of dismounted infantry, with less support from artillery fire because Russia is short of munitions.\". The BBC has been unable to independently verify these reports. The ministry did not give information on where such battles were taking place.. Analysts say that although there is indeed an ammunition shortage, the situation is more complex than the intelligence update suggests, with Russian forces still using twice as much ammunition as the Ukrainian side.. Meanwhile Russian forces appear to have secured a sufficient positional advantage in the besieged city of Bakhmut, . Bakhmut has seen months of fighting, as Russia tries to take control of the small city, where around 4,000 civilians remain. . Taking the city would be a rare battlefield success in recent months for Russia, but the city's strategic value has been questioned.. The ISW said Russia's positional advantage could allow a \"turning movement\" in the city. . The purpose of a turning movement is to force the enemy to abandon prepared defensive positions, and is different from the aim of an encirclement, which is to trap and destroy enemy forces, the ISW says. . \"The Russians may have intended to encircle Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut, but the Ukrainian command has signalled that it will likely withdraw rather than risk an encirclement,\" the ISW said.. However, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday that it had no intention of withdrawing from Bakhmut.. A statement by the Armed Forces General Staff acknowledged that Russian forces were still trying to surround the city, but said more than 100 attacks had been repelled in the eastern Donbas region in the past 24 hours. . Thousands of Russian troops have died trying to take Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of around 75,000.. ",
