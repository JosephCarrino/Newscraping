        "content": "Norfolk Southern is now facing multiple lawsuits filed on behalf of residents, many of whom were forced to evacuate their homes. . It has apologised for the incident. . The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has the power to fine or sanction firms over environmental concerns, said Norfolk Southern would \"pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they've inflicted on this community\".. Speaking at a news conference in East Palestine, the head of the EPA Michael Regan said the company would have to find and clean contaminated soil and water supplies and pay back the EPA for its own cleaning efforts, provide information online for residents and take part in public meetings at the EPA's request. . The EPA will also \"review and approve\" Norfolk Southern's work plan with the input of state and local authorities. . \"Full transparency is the only option,\" Mr Regan said, adding that in \"no way, shape or form will Norfolk Southern get off the hook\". . If Norfolk Southern failed to comply, the EPA would \"immediately\" carry out the work itself, charge them triple the cost of the clean-up operations and fine the firm up to an additional $70,000 (£58,000) a day. . Authorities in both Ohio and Pennsylvania have also suggested that further legal actions may follow. . In the aftermath of the derailment, residents of East Palestine have reported ailments including headaches and nausea, and expressed fears that local water supplies are potentially harmful despite the repeated assurances of state, local and federal officials that the water is safe. Earlier on Tuesday, the Ohio Health Department opened a health clinic for concerned residents.. At the news conference, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also said that Norfolk Southern \"needs to be made to pay\" for any medical costs stemming from the derailment. . Mr DeWine also called for longer-term changes to how railroads operate, calling it \"absurd\" and \"fundamentally wrong\" that a train carrying potentially hazardous chemicals was not required to alert local authorities when it was in transit through their areas. . \"That has to be changed,\" he said. \"We're going to do everything we can.\" . Last week, Norfolk Southern came under intense criticism from East Palestine residents after company representatives failed to appear at a town hall meeting aimed at easing fears.. The company said it was concerned about a \"growing physical threat\" to its employees from \"outside parties\" who may have been in attendance. . CEO Alan Shaw has since apologised for the derailment and vowed that the company will \"not walk away\" from East Palestine. . Former US President Donald Trump plans to visit the town on Wednesday and is expected to criticise the federal government's response to the derailment and chemical spill. . More than two weeks after the derailment, the incident has become a politically contentious issue. Senior Republicans have cited the response to the derailment as evidence that the federal government is neglecting domestic issues. . Earlier this week, East Palestine Mayor Trend Conaway told Fox News that US President Joe Biden had given a \"slap in the face\" to the town by travelling to Ukraine rather than Ohio. . \"That tells you right now, he doesn't care about us,\" he said. .

        "content": "The men had held a wedding ceremony in 2019, but same-sex marriage is not recognised in South Korea.. Activists say the ruling is a leap forward for LGBT rights in the country.. However, the case will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  . The plaintiff, So Seong-wook said he welcomed the ruling and \"recognition of a very obvious right that has not been given\".. In 2021, he sued the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) after being denied coverage on his partner Kim Yongmin's plan.. The couple had been granted coverage at first, but this was then revoked as the NHIS said they had made a mistake in granting it to the same-sex couple.. Celebrating the ruling, Mr So praised the court for seeing \"the principle of equality as an important issue\".. \"I think it has a great meaning for LGBTQ people who have been in a discriminatory situation, those who support them and all those who are discriminated against,\" he told the BBC.. The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's verdict. It found spousal coverage under the NHIS extended to not just families as defined by law. . It also found that denying same-sex couples such benefits amounted to discrimination.. \"Everyone can be a minority in some way. To be in the minority is to be different from the majority and cannot be wrong itself,\" the court judgement read.. \"In a society dominated by the principle of majority rule, awareness of the rights of minorities and efforts to protect them are necessary.\". A Human Rights Watch report last year found that discrimination against LGBT people in South Korean society remained \"pervasive\". . Same-sex couples  - without the legal status of marriage - are often excluded from government benefits for newlyweds.. After Tuesday's court ruling, Amnesty International released a statement saying: \"There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTI community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome.\".

        "content": "The BBC goes undercover on Kenya’s tea plantations. Lawmaker Beatrice Kemei said she watched the report with \"utter shock\".. The BBC found more than 70 women had been abused by their managers at plantations operated by two British companies - Unilever and James Finlay. . The companies say they have suspended the three managers in question and are shocked by the allegations.. The Fairtrade Foundation described the allegations as \"appalling\", and said the investigation - by BBC Africa Eye and BBC Panaroma - were \"nothing less than a #MeToo moment for tea\".. Ms Kemei, who serves as woman representative for a tea-growing area in Kericho county, said the report highlighted the \"entrenched\" sexual harassment at \"tea multinationals operating in our country\".. MP Beatrice Elachi said it was unfortunate that such incidents were still taking place.. \"Today is a very difficult day for me as a woman, leader and citizen of Kenya. Today I've been reminded that slavery still exists in this nation; I cannot explain how a man has violated women in tea plantations for 30 years and nothing has been done,\" she was quoted by local media as saying.. Deputy Speaker Gladys Shollei ordered a committee of MPs to complete an investigation into the allegations within two weeks. . In the BBC investigation, one woman said she had been infected with HIV by her supervisor, after being pressured into having sex with him.. Another woman said a divisional manager stopped her job until she agreed to have sex with him.. \"It is just torture; he wants to sleep with you, then you get a job,\" she said.. A BBC undercover reporter, who posed as a jobseeker, was invited to a job interview by a recruiter for James Finlay & Co. . It turned out to be in a hotel room, where she was pinned against a window and asked to undress by the recruiter, who has worked on Finlay's plantations for more than 30 years, and had already been flagged as a \"predator\" by a number of women who spoke to the BBC.. \"I'll give you some money, then I'll give you a job. I have helped you, help me,\" he said.. \"We'll lie down, finish and go. Then you come and work.\". Unilever faced similar allegations more than 10 years ago and launched a \"zero tolerance\" approach to sexual harassment as well as a reporting system and other measures, but the BBC found evidence that allegations of sexual harassment were not being acted on.. The BBC's Tom Odula spoke to women who worked on tea farms run by both companies. A number told him that because work is so scarce, they are left with no choice but to give in to the sexual demands of their bosses or face having no income.. British supermarket chain Tesco said it takes the allegations \"extremely seriously\" and is in \"constant dialogue\" with Finlay's to ensure \"robust measures\" are taken.. In response to the BBC investigation, Sainsbury's, another supermarket chain, said: \"These horrific allegations have no place in our supply chain.\" . On Monday, it issued a revised, updated statement saying it will \"take robust action to safeguard workers\" in its \"tea supply chain.\". Starbucks also issued a statement on Monday, saying it was \"deeply concerned\" and has taken \"immediate action\" to suspend purchasing from James Finlay & Co in Kenya. . James Finlay & Co said it had suspended the manager, and had reported him to the police. It was investigating whether its Kenyan operation has \"an endemic issue with sexual violence\", the company added.. Unilever said it was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the allegations. The company sold its operation in Kenya while the BBC was secretly filming.. The new owner, Lipton Teas and Infusions, said it had suspended two managers, and had ordered a \"full and independent investigation\".. ",
