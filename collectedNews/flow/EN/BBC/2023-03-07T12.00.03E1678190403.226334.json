        "content": "In the video, the Ukrainian soldier is seen smoking a cigarette in a trench. He says \"glory to Ukraine\" before being shot with automatic weapons.. The soldier has not been officially named, but the BBC has spoken to a family who say they recognised him.. A woman, who said she was the soldier's sister, said: \"My brother would certainly be capable of standing up to the Russians like that. . \"He never hid the truth in his life and certainly wouldn't do so in front of the enemy.\". The soldier served in the 30th Brigade of Ukraine's armed forces, the BBC has confirmed.. In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the prisoner of war (POW) is shot dead. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made. It first emerged on social media on Monday. Russia has not commented.. Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes since President Vladimir Putin launched a full scale-invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Russia denies the allegations.. In his video address, President Zelensky said \"the occupiers\" killed \"a warrior who bravely said to their faces: 'Glory to Ukraine!'\". \"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\". Mr Zelensky was referring to a battle cry in Ukraine's military that has become popular among millions of Ukrainians.. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the footage was \"another proof this was is genocidal\", calling for an \"immediate investigation\" by the International Criminal Court.. Ukraine's human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets accused Russian troops of committing war crimes by violating the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of POWs.. And Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said a criminal investigation had already been opened.. Ukraine has previously accused Russian troops of torturing, raping and killing Ukrainian prisoners of war.. Last July, a video emerged that showed a captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. The Russian soldier filmed carrying out the attack in the town of Severodonetsk was identified as a member of a unit belonging to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.. In November, Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of executing a group of Russian prisoners.. It followed a video from the front line in eastern Ukraine showing the apparent surrender of a number of soldiers, in an incident that ended in their deaths.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Japan forces H3 rocket to self-destruct after engine failure. Its space agency had to send a self-destruct command to the H3 rocket when its second-stage engine failed minutes after lift-off.. Observers say it is a significant setback for Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).. The government called the test failure \"extremely regrettable\".. The H3 rocket is the first medium-lift rocket designed by Japan in three decades. . It has been presented as a cheaper alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 for launching commercial and government satellites into Earth's orbit.. On Tuesday, engineers had aimed to send the 57m (187ft) rocket into space with a monitoring satellite on board. The ALOS-3 system is capable of detecting North Korean missile launches.. But Jaxa said soon after launch, engineers were forced to send a self-destruct prompt to the H3 after it experienced \"reduced velocity\" in the second stage of its launch. . Tuesday's launch came after an aborted launch in February, when the rocket failed to get off the launch pad due to faulty rocket boosters. . \"Unlike the previous cancellation and postponement, this time it was a complete failure,\" Hirotaka Watanabe, a space policy professor at Osaka University told Reuters.. \"This will have a serious impact on Japan's future space policy, space business and technological competitiveness,\" he added.. Japan's science minister Keiko Nagaoka said authorities would investigate the cause of the engine failure. . She apologised for \"failing to meet the expectations of the public and related parties\" and described the development as \"extremely regrettable\". . Japan had presented the H3 as a viable commercial alternative to the Falcon 9 rocket because the H3 ran on a lower-cost engine with 3D-printed parts. . Had the mission succeeded, JAXA said it had planned to launch the H3 around six times a year for the next two decades.. Japan is deepening cooperation with the US in space and has committed to carrying cargo to the planned .  - which NASA plans to deploy to the moon's orbit.. Tokyo's broader space programme also involves sending people to the moon again, including Japanese astronauts.. ",
