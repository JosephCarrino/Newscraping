        "content": "They asked for an appraisal with another firm - this time with a white friend posing as the California home's owner. It was valued at nearly $1.5m.. , 92.4% of home appraisers are white.. In 2021, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation released a study of 12 million appraisals over five years, showing that homes in black and Hispanic neighbourhoods were routinely undervalued.. Ms Tate-Austin and Mr Austin bought the house in 2016 in the San Francisco suburb of Marin City for about $550,000. . The city has a large African-American population (38%), compared with the predominantly white Marin County, where it is situated, in which only 2.8% of the population is black.. In 2020, when interest rates were historically low, the couple decided to refinance their mortgage.. The year before, a company had appraised their four-bedroom property for $1,450,000, after they made major improvements, including adding square-footage. . But when they decided to refinance again in 2020 to take advantage of low rates, they were appraised for just $995,000.. So they came up with an experiment. What if their friend, a white woman, posed as the homeowner instead? . They removed all trace of themselves from their home, including their African-themed artwork and their photographs. . The process is known as \"white-washing\", and black homeowners across the country have reported doing it in order to sell their properties.. Several weeks after their first estimate, a different appraiser toured the house for the decoy white homeowner. . This time, it was appraised at $1,482,500 - almost half a million dollars more than the initial estimate, . .. \"You feel a sense of relief like, 'I told you.' Then you just feel a sense of sadness,\" Ms Tate-Austin told the BBC's broadcast partner CBS News in 2021. . \"We had to do what we had to do in order to have our house appraised for what it should have appraised for from the start.. \"I mean, it's the financial impact, but it's the emotional impact. It's the feeling every day like, the tax of being African-American in this country, like you don't know, it's a coin toss.\" . The couple sued the first appraisal company for violating the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits housing discrimination.. The lawsuit was settled on Wednesday for an undisclosed amount. . As part of the agreement, the defendants do not have to admit any liability in the case, but will have to watch a documentary about discriminatory real estate and attend a training session on the history of racial discrimination in real estate..

        "content": "Buildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.. Ukraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.. The military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones fired.. In western Ukraine, at least five people were killed in Lviv after a rocket hit their home, the region's governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.. One person has died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is Europe's largest, meant the \"last link\" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off.. Russia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was \"a provocation\".. In Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.. Mr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.. A mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.. \"About 15\" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with \"critical infrastructure facilities\" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.. Other regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.. The attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when . .. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.. The US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.. She said the war in Ukraine had become a \"grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage\".. \"We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,\" she said.. Ms Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional \"mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources\" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.. Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\".  in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently. . ",
