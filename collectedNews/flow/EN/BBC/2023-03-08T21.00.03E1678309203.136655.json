        "content": "Police also intervened in protests in the city of Thessaloniki.. The government has been accused of mismanagement after the head on collision between a passenger train and a freight train on 28 February. . \"I am here to pay tribute to the dead but also to express my anger and my frustration,\" one protester in Athens told AFP on Wednesday. \"This government must go.\". \"You feel angry because the government did nothing for all of those kids,\" another told Reuters, referring to the fact that many of the 350 people onboard the train were students.. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who is facing re-election this year, has come under mounting pressure to resign over the country's deadliest rail crash on record. . He and his government have been criticised for trying to shift the blame for the crash onto the station master who has been charged with manslaughter. . Doctors, teachers, bus drivers and ferry crew members were among those to strike on Wednesday.. They joined rail workers, who have been staging rolling protests since the crash.. Train drivers have said they told the government about the long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn of danger ahead.. \"We drivers have filed complaints about these things, we have gone on strike about it... but unfortunately no one listened to us,\" the head of the Greek train drivers union, Kostas Genidounias, has said. . \"They told us we were lying, we were slanderous, we had other interests, in the end it showed that the workers were right and unfortunately we experienced this tragedy.\". Greece's new transport minister, George Gerapetritis, who was appointed after his predecessor quit following the crash, has promised the government will fix what he described as the country's \"chronically ill train transport system\". He promised no train would set off again without \"safety at the maximum possible level\". . He also said that \"accidents will happen\" and that human error, which the government has largely blamed for the crash, will occur even with an electronic system. . In Thessaloniki, where the train had been travelling to when it crashed, police fired tear gas at some people throwing stones outside the local railway station.. \"It could have been any of us,\" said one student. \"In this country, it seems that we live by luck these days.. Things have to change without a doubt and I feel just outraged with what has happened.\". ",

        "content": "Some US officials have concluded that Covid \"most likely\" came from an unintended lab leak in Wuhan, China.. But many scientists point out there is no evidence that it leaked from a lab.. And the White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the virus's origins.. The committee of nine Republicans and seven Democrats has said it would aim to conduct its work above partisanship.. But at Wednesday's hearing, the committee's top Democrat Raul Ruiz argued against the inclusion of witness Nicholas Wade over a controversial book he authored.. Mr Ruiz said the former New York Times journalist's inclusion was dangerous and that he could not be relied on.. The congressman said the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, Dr David Duke, had endorsed a 2014 book by Mr Wade, which argued races evolved differently.. Mr Wade denied it was a racist book and another key witness, Dr Robert Redfield, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, defended Mr Wade as \"an outstanding science writer\".. Dr Redfield was an early proponent of the lab leak theory, and used his appearance on Wednesday to restate his opposition to so-called gain of function research, in which viruses are manipulated to become more infectious in lab environments.. He told the committee it was \"not scientifically plausible\" to him that the virus had natural origins.. \"It was told to me that they wanted a single narrative, and that I obviously had a different point of view,\" he said.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. Dr Redfield told the committee he believed the US taxpayer had funded gain of function research at the Wuhan institute.. Last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray .  as the \"most likely\" origin of Covid.. A few days before that, the US Department of Energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan, but could only reach that conclusion with \"low confidence\".. In response to that, many scientists who have studied the virus said that there was no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.. ",
