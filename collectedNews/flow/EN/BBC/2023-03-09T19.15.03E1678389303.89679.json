        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. The attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west, with power blackouts reported in several areas. . Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "It is the first convoy to be sent under the plan, approved by the Latvian parliament last month.. MPs agreed to allow the transfer of state-owned cars to the Ukrainian military and hospitals.. Late last year, Latvia changed the law so that drivers found with 1.5mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - three times the legal limit - could have their vehicles seized and sold by the government.. Latvia has among the worst rates of drinking and driving in Europe, according to public broadcaster LSM, with an estimated 3,500 cases a year.. The change in the law led to a surge in confiscations that filled state pounds in Latvia in a matter of weeks.. As a result, authorities pledged to hand over two dozen cars a week to Twitter Convoy, a Latvian charity that sends donated vehicles to Ukraine.. \"No-one expected that people are drunk-driving so many vehicles,\" the NGO's founder, Reinis Poznaks, told Reuters news agency. \"They can't sell them as fast as people are drinking. So that's why I came with the idea - send them to Ukraine.\". The first eight cars had a combined value of about €18,500 (£16,500), according to Latvian website Delfi. One owner had left a Russian flag pinned on his seized vehicle, Reuters reported.. About a quarter of Latvia's population are ethnic Russians and Latvia moved fast after the Russian invasion of Ukraine to ban dozens of websites assessed as disseminating Kremlin propaganda.. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly sought to justify the war in Ukraine as providing protection for Russian-speakers with the Kremlin's protection. . ",

        "content": "Under the bill, non-government groups and media would be targeted if they take over 20% of funding from abroad.. The main ruling party said it was pulling the bill \"unconditionally\".. Describing itself as a party of government responsible to all members of society, Georgian Dream referred to the need to reduce \"confrontation\" in society.. Georgia has applied for candidate status of the European Union and sought to join Nato. EU officials had condemned the draft legislation as incompatible with EU values. . In a statement, the EU delegation in Georgia said .  and encouraged political leaders to resume \"pro-EU reforms\".. The government's U-turn followed a second night of clashes between riot police and protesters outside parliament. Tear gas and water cannon were used to disperse the demonstrators as they chanted \"no to the Russian law\".. Protesters arrested during the demonstrations have been released, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. . Officials said some were brought before the court but the rest \"were released based on the expiration of the term of stay in the pre-trial detention centre\". . Meanwhile, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili praised protesters for coming out against the proposal. Ms Zourabichvili had backed the demonstrations and had vowed to veto the bill, although ultimately the government would have had the power to override her move.. \"I want to congratulate society on its first victory. I am proud of the people who made their voices heard,\" Ms Zurabishvili said in a televised address from New York. \"There is distrust towards the government as we pursue our European path.\". In its statement, Georgian Dream complained that the proposal had been unfairly labelled and said that as the \"emotional background subsides\" it would explain the importance of the bill and transparency in foreign funding to the public.. Despite the decision to drop the bill, opposition parties said they had no plans to halt the protests. They called for clarity on how the proposals were to be withdrawn and demanded the release of protesters detained this week.. Armaz Akhvlediani, an independent opposition member of parliament and former secretary-general of Georgian Dream, welcomed the party's promise to withdraw the legislation but said it had \"Russian interests\" that worked against \"democracy and rule of law\". . Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili had earlier condemned the \"stir\" over the bill. His party maintained that the legislation mimicked American laws from the 1930s, an argument also used by the Kremlin when it passed a similar law in 2012.. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russia had \"absolutely nothing\" to do with the bill, as he sought to distance his country from the protests. . He said the Kremlin did not inspire the proposal and that the US \"pioneered the practice of introducing these laws\".. Mr Peskov also advised Russians living in Georgia to be \"extremely careful\" and stay away from the street riots. . That Russian law has gradually intensified and now suppresses Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers, who are required to label their content with the sinister phrase \"foreign agent\".. \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old protester Luka Kimeridze.. Eka Gigauri of Transparency International in Georgia told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information..

        "content": "Ukraine's SBU security service said the claims were a provocation by Moscow.. Transnistria is a small sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine which is dependent on Russia.. Since 1992 it has hosted a contingent of around 1,700 Russian peacekeepers. Moscow has warned that any threat to the entity's security would be an attack on Russia itself.. Moldova itself has a pro-Western government but fears Russia is plotting a coup, and last month Ukrainian officials accused Russia of \"psy-ops\" after Moscow accused it of plotting an invasion of Transnistria. . Authorities in the Transnistrian capital Tiraspol quoted by the Reuters news agency said that the suspects were operating \"under the direct control and instructions of representatives of the security service of Ukraine (SBU) to carry out the murder of officials\".. They said the pair most likely intended to detonate a Land Rover full of explosives in central Tiraspol to cause maximum casualties, and that they were targeting officials and their families.. The SBU denied that there was any planned attack.. \"Any statements by representatives... of the fake 'People's Republic of Transnistria' regarding the participation of the SBU in the preparation of a terrorist attack should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin,\" the agency said in a statement.. Moldovan officials said they were investigating any claims and were ready to respond to any security threats.. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. Last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine, bringing it one step closer to joining the bloc. . But it has faced a major energy crisis because of its outdated power infrastructure and problems with gas supplies from Russia.. Rampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by pro-Russian groups. . The country's pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova's leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. . The Kremlin has accused Moldova's leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.. Dominated by Russian speakers, Transnistria proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by the Russian troops stationed there.. As long as Transnistria's future remains unclear, tensions will remain. Moldova's new prime minister has made demilitarising the area as a priority and the foreign ministry has said it will continue to seek a peaceful solution.. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointedly revoked a 2012 decree committing Russia to finding a solution for Transnistria based on respect for Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity..
