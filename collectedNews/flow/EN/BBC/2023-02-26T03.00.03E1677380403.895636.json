        "content": "Turnout appeared to be high, with many young, first-time voters arriving before dawn to cast their ballots.. The elections are the biggest democratic exercise in Africa, with 87 million people eligible to vote.. Politics has been dominated by two parties - the ruling APC and the PDP - since the restoration of multi-party democracy 24 years ago.. But this time, there is also a strong challenge from a third-party candidate in the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari - the Labour Party's Peter Obi, who is backed by many young people.. Tens of thousands of polling stations are counting the results, which will be collated and sent to the electoral headquarters in the capital Abuja.. The final result is not expected until at least Tuesday.. At a press briefing, the electoral chief, Mahmood Yakubu, apologised for the delays in voting, but he said that everyone who was in a queue by 13:30 GMT (14:30 local time) would be allowed to cast their ballots, even though polling stations were officially supposed to close by then.. Voters in the biggest city, Lagos, cheered as electoral officers arrived at a polling station in the suburb of Lekki nearly four hours after polls had officially closed.. There have also been reports of violence and ballot boxes being snatched in Lagos.. Although some voters were angry at the delays, others waited patiently to vote. . \"As a Nigerian you expect any eventuality, so I came out with my power bank and a bottle of water. I will wait till they arrive so I can vote,\" first-time voter Edith told the BBC.. Mr Yakubu said that armed men had attacked some polling units in the southern state of Delta and the northern state of Katsina, where voter card verification machines were carted away.. They were subsequently replaced and security boosted to allow voting to take place, he added.. But voting was postponed to Sunday at 141 polling stations in the oil-rich southern state of Bayelsa because of disruptions.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. The lead-up to the polls was overshadowed by a cash shortage caused by a botched attempt to redesign the currency, leading to widespread chaos at banks and cash machines as desperate people sought access to their money.. The new notes were introduced in order to tackle inflation, and also vote-buying. On the eve of the election a member of the House of Representatives was arrested with almost $500,000 (Â£419,000) in cash, and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say.. Whoever wins will have to deal with the currency redesign, a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives, with another vote for state governors in March.. The election has seen a huge interest from young people - a third of eligible voters are below 35.. Mr Obi, 61, is hoping to break up Nigeria's two-party system after joining the Labour Party last May.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the south.. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted as he is unlikely to win.. Instead, the PDP, which ruled until 2015, wants Nigerians to vote for Atiku Abubakar, 76 - the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north.. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Bola Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. ",

The Cameroonian conservationist was so captivated he set up a project to fight for the future of the endangered species.. \"When I found this species was unique - the biggest one in the world - I said this is something that we cannot easily find elsewhere and I was proud of it,\" he says.. \"People in the area say they are blessed to have something like that; they attach to it a cultural value.\". For decades, the goliath frog has been over-hunted for food and the pet trade in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. . Its habitat beside rivers and streams is fast being destroyed and the frog is now classified as endangered on the official extinction Red List.. The frog is little-known to science and even in Cameroon many local people are unaware of its value to the ecosystem, such as preying on the insects that damage crops.. The conservation team works to persuade hunters to become citizen scientists, recording sightings of the frog rather than using it for food.. They are also working with local groups to help set up snail farming to provide an alternative food source.. The conservation work is starting to pay off, with the goliath frog returning to new rivers in the Mount Nlonako Reserve.. A call from a former poacher to report a frog had been captured by a neighbour was a turning point. Cedric was able to rescue the frog and return it to the wild.. \"I believe we can have it forever and we can continue to be proud of it,\" he says.. The project to save the goliath frog is supported by the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) run by Fauna & Flora International, BirdLife International and the Wildlife Conservation Society..

Penny Wong, the first openly gay female in Australia's parliament, also took part in the celebrations. . The presence of the prime minister, who has marched in the parade in the past as an MP, was greeted with cheers but his critics have accused him of pandering to a minority that's hijacking Australia's social agenda.. Opposition MP, Barnaby Joyce, criticised Mr Albanese for attending a party instead of dealing with a crime crisis in Alice Springs - a remote town in Australia's Northern Territory. . Mr Albanese wasn't the only politician to attend Mardi Gras - members of other parties, including the Greens and Liberals, also came to show their support. . It's not the first time an Australian prime minister has attended the event - Malcolm Turnbull was present in 2016 but did not march. . The Mardi Gras parade has been running since 1978 and grew out of a protest marking the anniversary of .  - an uprising by members of the LGBT community in New York more than 50 years ago. . For the past two years the parade has been held as a seated event at the Sydney Cricket Ground due to the pandemic. . This year's event coincides in Sydney with WorldPride, which promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally. . Other world leaders who have taken part in pride parades in the past include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern. . ",

The prisoners are left sitting on the floor with their hands behind their shaven heads, stacked closely together, before being taken to their cells. . This video can not be played. Watch: Suspected gang members taken to mega-prison. President Bukele tweeted that the first 2,000 people were transferred \"at dawn, in a single operation\" to the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, which he says is the largest jail in the Americas.. \"This will be their new house, where they will live for decades, all mixed, unable to do any further harm to the population.\". The mega-prison - in Tecoluca, 74 kilometers (46 miles) southeast of the capital San Salvador - comprises eight buildings. Each has 32 cells of about 100 square meters (1,075 square feet) to hold \"more than 100\" prisoners, the government says. . The cells only have two sinks and two toilets each.. President Bukele declared a \"war on gangs\" last March, passing emergency measures which have been extended several times.. The emergency powers have been controversial as they limit some constitutional rights, such as allowing the security forces to arrest suspects without a warrant.. More than 64,000 suspects have been arrested in the anti-crime drive. . Authorities have said criminal gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio-18 number tens of thousands and are responsible for homicides, extortion and drug-trafficking. The aim of the mass arrests is to make the gangs \"disappear altogether\", the government says.. Human rights organisations have argued that innocent people have been caught up in the policy, and some of those held have reported being subjected to \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\".. But Bukele's anti-gang push remains popular with Salvadorans.. ",
