        "content": "\"It's unbelievable but true,\" he said. \"We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.\". Germany is one of many countries helping Ukraine defend its territory.. Russia launched its bloody, full-scale invasion almost one year ago, prompting Western countries to send weapons and aid to the government in Kyiv.. Speaking in Volgograd - the modern name for Stalingrad - Mr Putin hinted that he could seek to move beyond conventional weapons.. \"Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield do not understand, it seems, that a modern war with Russia will be very different for them,\" the 70-year-old leader said. . \"We are not sending our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond. It won't be limited to the use of armoured hardware. Everyone must understand this.\" . Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on Mr Putin's comments, but did tell reporters that \"as new weapons are delivered by the collective West, Russia will make greater use of its potential to respond\". . Mr Putin was in Volgograd to mark the anniversary of the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, the World War Two conflict which saw the Soviet army capture nearly 91,000 German troops and turn the tide of the war.. Over a million people perished in the battle - the bloodiest of World War Two. . Throughout the war in Ukraine, Mr Putin has falsely sought to present Russia's invasion as a battle against nationalists and Nazis - who he claims are leading the Kyiv government. . And he returned to the theme throughout his speech. . \"Now, unfortunately, we see that the ideology of Nazism, already in its modern guise, in its modern manifestation, again creates direct threats to the security of our country,\" he said. . \"We are once again forced to repulse the aggression of the collective West.\" . But he vowed that while it was \"unbelievable but true\" that Russia was again being threatened by German tanks, Moscow had an answer for any country that threatened it. . Volgograd was temporarily renamed Stalingrad for the day to mark the occasion, and earlier this week a new bust of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unveiled. . Stalin - who led the Soviet Union between 1924 and his death in 1953 - was accused of orchestrating a famine in Ukraine between 1932-33. . The event - called the Holodomor by Ukrainians - killed an estimated 5 million people and was recognised as a genocide earlier this week in Bulgaria. . Mr Putin also laid flowers at the grave of the Soviet marshal who oversaw the defence of the city, and visited the main memorial complex where he led a moment of silence for those that died in the battle. . Meanwhile, thousands of Volgograd residents lined the city's streets to watch a military parade. . As planes roared overhead, modern and World War Two-era tanks rolled along the centre of the city. Some of the modern vehicles were marked with the letter Z, which has become the symbol of Russia's invasion. . Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was preparing to take \"revenge\" against the West for aiding Ukraine. . \"Now Russia is concentrating its forces. We all know that. It is preparing to try to take revenge, not only against Ukraine, but against a free Europe and the free world,\" Mr Zelensky said in Kyiv. . Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said Russia was \"increasing the pace of adaptation to sanctions\" and urged the EU leader to impose additional restrictions on the Russian economy. .

        "content": "The crew flew a special flight path, drawing a huge crown in the sky with the numbers seven, four and seven.. It comes days after workers said their final goodbye to the iconic plane, dubbed the Queen of the Skies. . The 747 is one of the world's most recognisable planes, having been in production for more than 50 years, and is credited with starting the era of the jumbo jet, being the first aircraft to earn the nickname.. On Tuesday, thousands of employees from Boeing gathered at the company's factory in Everett, Washington - the home of the 747 since 1967 -  to say farewell. . Among those in attendance was actor John Travolta, an aviation enthusiast and private pilot. . As an ambassador for Qantas airlines, he remembered learning to fly the 747-400.. \"[It was] the toughest programme that any commercial pilot will ever have to endure,\"  he said.. Elsewhere in the crowd were also some of those who helped develop the jet in the 1960s - the so-called \"incredibles\".. The last 747 rolled off the assembly line 7 December, completing inspections, flight tests and getting a paint job before finally being handed over to Atlas, which operates the aircraft as freighters.. Designed in just 28 months, the 747 was the first ever twin-aisle jetliner and was first introduced by the now-defunct airline Pan Am in 1970.. Traditionally one of Boeing's best selling products, the 747 has suffered declining demand in recent years, as both the company and its European rival Airbus developed more fuel-efficient and profitable planes.  . In 2020, Boeing announced that it would end production. Its largest new jet, the delayed 777X, is not expected to hit the market until 2025.. ",

        "content": "He was convicted of committing abuses of power while in office. He says the charges were politically motivated. . Since his imprisonment, his health has deteriorated significantly and he has alleged he was poisoned by authorities.. Mr Saakashvili was arrested in 2021 after making a surprise return to Georgia by smuggling himself into the country on a ferry from Ukraine. He called for mass anti-government demonstrations, but was quickly arrested by Georgian authorities. . He was convicted in absentia of abuses of power while in office.. The Georgian Justice Minister Rati Bregadze said he was self-harming and his condition was a result of his refusal to eat. . Mr Saakashvili's medical team said his weight had dropped from 115kg (254 pounds) to 68kg (150 pounds) since his imprisonment.. Among the world leaders calling for his release were Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said authorities were \"torturing and killing\" him. . During a press conference, Mr Zelensky said he believed the current Georgian government was trying \"to kill\" Mr Saakashvili. . Mr Saakashvili was granted Ukrainian citizenship in 2015, and spoke only in Ukrainian at his court appearance, wearing a t-shirt with \"I am Ukrainian\" printed on it. He also served as the governor of the western province of Odesa between 2015 and 2016.. The Moldovan President Maia Sandu also called for Mr Saakashvili's immediate release;. \"Torturing an opposition leader to death is unacceptable for a country that wants to join the European Union,\" she wrote in a tweet.. Empathy, an organisation supporting victims of torture in Georgia, alleged on 1 December that Mr Saakashvili had been diagnosed with illnesses \"incompatible with imprisonment\" and that Georgian and foreign medical experts had found evidence of heavy-metal poisoning.. On Thursday, the European Parliament debated Mr Saakashvili's health, where the European Commissioner for Budget and Administration, Johannes Hahn, said the Georgian government was obliged to provide him appropriate healthcare.. Late last year, Mr Saakashvili gave French President Emmanuel Macron a hand-written note reading: \"SOS. I am dying, I have very little time left.\". Georgian authorities have said Mr Saakasvhili is feigning his condition to secure a release from prison, and have accused him of self-harming.. ",

        "content": "Police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari said they had CCTV footage revealing the man's final movements, and were closing in on the \"terror network\" responsible. . He also confirmed a head found at the site was the attacker's.. Monday's blast - one of the deadliest attacks in Pakistan in years - took place at a 50-year-old mosque in a high-security police zone called Police Lines.. At least 100 people were killed, of whom most were police officers. . Officers failed to check the attacker as they assumed he was one of them, Mr Ansari said. \"I admit this was a security lapse. My men could not stop it. This is my fault.\". He explained that police had been able to trace the bomber's motorcycle journey before the attack using CCTV footage.. As the man parked his motorcycle, he was \"in a police uniform and was wearing a mask and a helmet\". After entering the compound, the attacker asked a constable where the mosque was.. Mr Ansari - who heads the force in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province - added that ball bearings had been found which were used in a suicide jacket. . He said 10-12kg (22-26lb) of TNT explosives were used in the blast, which caused the mosque's roof to collapse on the hundreds who were praying in the building.. Police do not believe the man was a \"lone wolf\", and have suggested there is an entire network behind him.. A claim that the hard-line Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out Monday's bombing was later denied by the group, which blamed it on the commander of a breakaway faction.. In the past the TTP has refrained from claiming some attacks on mosques, schools or markets, preferring to cast its violence as a war with security forces and not against the Pakistani people.. In recent years attacks by the TTP and other militant groups have been on the rise again in north-west Pakistan after the Afghan Taliban gained power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021. . Pakistan says its forces are ready to take on the militants.. But the police remain ill-equipped to fight the highly trained and well-armed insurgents. Recent militant attacks include overrunning police stations - and in some cases, police did not offer resistance.. ",

        "content": "Watch: \"I apologise to the whole Ukrainian nation\" - former Russian army officer. Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector.. At one site in southern Ukraine, he said \"the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week\". . \"Every day, at night, sometimes twice a day.\". Mr Yefremov tried to resign from the army numerous times - but he ended up being dismissed for refusing to return to Ukraine. He has now fled Russia.. Using photographs and military documents supplied by Mr Yefremov, the BBC has verified he was in Ukraine early in the war - in the Zaporizhzhia region, including the city of Melitopol.. Konstantin Yefremov's face flickers into view on my computer screen and we start to talk. He is a man with a story to tell. Until recently he was a Russian army officer. . Deployed to Ukraine last year, the former senior lieutenant has agreed to tell me about the crimes he says he witnessed there - including torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He will talk about his comrades looting occupied areas of Ukraine, and describe brutal interrogation sessions, led by a Russian colonel, in which men were shot and threatened with rape.. On 10 February 2022, Mr Yefremov says he arrived in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia nine years ago. He was the head of a de-mining unit of the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division - and was usually based in Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus. He and his men were sent to take part in \"military exercises\", he says. . \"At the time no-one believed there would be war. Everyone thought this was only a drill. I'm sure even senior officers didn't know.\". Mr Yefremov recalls seeing Russian troops taping identification marks on their uniforms and painting the letter \"Z\" on military equipment and vehicles. Within days, \"Z\" had become the symbol of what the Kremlin was calling its \"special military operation\". . Mr Yefremov claims he wanted nothing to do with it.   . \"I decided to quit. I went to my commander and explained my position. He took me to a senior officer who called me a traitor and a coward.. \"I left my gun, got in a taxi and drove off. I wanted to return to my base in Chechnya and resign officially. Then my comrades telephoned me with a warning. . \"A colonel had promised to put me in prison for up to 10 years for desertion and he'd alerted the police.\". Mr Yefremov says he called a military lawyer, who advised him to turn around. . \"I realise now I should have ignored that and driven on,\" he says. \"But I was afraid of being put in jail.\" . He went back to join his men.. Mr Yefremov insists he is \"anti-war\". He assures me he did not participate in Russia's annexation of Crimea, or fight in eastern Ukraine when war first erupted in the Donbas nine years ago. . In 2014, Russia was not only accused of orchestrating a separatist uprising there, but of sending in its own troops. Konstantin also tells me he has not taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria. . \"For the last three years I had been involved in mine clearance in Chechnya, a place that had experienced two wars. I think the work I've done there has benefited people.\". Mr Yefremov was placed in temporary charge of a rifle platoon. On 27 February, three days after the Russian invasion, he says he and his men were ordered to move north from occupied Crimea. They headed for the city of Melitopol.. The next 10 days were spent at an airfield which had already been captured by Russian troops. He describes the looting he witnessed.. \"Soldiers and officers grabbed everything they could. They climbed all over the planes and went through all the buildings. One soldier took away a lawnmower. He said proudly, 'I'll take this home and cut the grass next to our barracks.' . \"Buckets, axes, bicycles, they bunged it all in their trucks. So much stuff they had to squat down to fit in the vehicles.\". Mr Yefremov has sent us photographs he says he took at Melitopol air base. They show transport planes and a building on fire. . They are among a number of pictures and documents he has shared - and which we have verified - to confirm Mr Yefremov's identity, rank and his movements in Ukraine in the spring of 2022. . Online mapping tools confirmed the images of Melitopol air base.. For a month and a half, he and eight soldiers under his command guarded a Russian artillery unit there.. \"The whole time we slept outside,\" he recalls. \"We were so hungry we started hunting for rabbits and pheasants. One time we came across a mansion. There was a Russian fighter inside. 'We're with the 100th Brigade and we live here now,' the soldier said. . \"There was so much food. The fridges were packed. There was enough food to survive a nuclear war. But the soldiers living there were catching the Japanese carp in the pond outside and eating them.\". Konstantin Yefremov's group moved to guard what he describes as a \"logistics headquarters\" in April - in the town of Bilmak, to the north-east of Melitopol. There, he says he witnessed interrogations and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners.. He recalls a day when three prisoners were brought in.. \"One of them admitted to being a sniper. On hearing this, the Russian colonel lost his mind. He hit him, he pulled the Ukrainian's trousers down and asked if he was married. . \"'Yes,' the prisoner replied. 'Then someone bring me a mop,' said the colonel. 'We'll turn you into a girl and send your wife the video.'\". Another time, says Mr Yefremov, the colonel asked the prisoner to name all the Ukrainian nationalists in his unit.. \"The Ukrainian didn't understand the question. He replied that the soldiers were naval infantry of the Ukrainian armed forces. For that answer they knocked out some of his teeth.\". The Kremlin wants Russians to believe that, in Ukraine, Russia is fighting fascists, neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. This false narrative serves to dehumanise Ukrainians in the eyes of the Russian public and the military.. Mr Yefremov says the Ukrainian prisoner had a blindfold on. . \"The colonel put a pistol to the prisoner's forehead and said 'I'm going to count to three and then shoot you in the head.' . \"He counted and then fired just to the side of his head, on both sides. The colonel started shouting at him. I said: 'Comrade colonel! He can't hear you, you've deafened him!'\". Mr Yefremov describes how the colonel gave orders that the Ukrainians shouldn't be given normal food - only water and crackers. But he says: \"We tried to give them hot tea and cigarettes.\" . So that the prisoners didn't sleep on bare ground, Mr Yefremov also recalls how his men tossed them hay - \"at night, so that no-one saw us\". . During another interrogation, Mr Yefremov says the colonel shot a prisoner in the arm - and in the right leg under the knee, which hit the bone. Konstantin says his men bandaged the prisoner up and went to the Russian commanders - \"not to the Colonel, he was crazy\" - and said the prisoner needed to go to hospital, otherwise he would die from blood loss.. \"We dressed him up in a Russian uniform and took him to hospital. We told him: 'Don't say you're a Ukrainian prisoner of war, because either the doctors will refuse to treat you, or the injured Russian soldiers will hear and shoot you and we won't be able to stop them.\". The UN's Human Rights Office has been documenting cases of mistreatment of prisoners in the war in Ukraine. It has interviewed more than 400 POWs - both Ukrainians and Russians. . \"Unfortunately, we've found there is torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war happening on both sides,\" says Matilda Bogner, head of the UN's Ukraine-based monitoring team. . \"If we compare the violations, the torture or ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war tends to happen at almost every stage of confinement. And, for the most part, the conditions of internment are worse in many areas of Russia or occupied Ukraine.\". The worst forms of torture or ill treatment for Ukrainian prisoners of war usually occur during interrogation, says Ms Bogner. They can be subjected to electrocution and a whole range of torture methods - she says - including hanging people up and beating them. . \"When they arrive at places of internment there are often so-called welcoming beatings. They also often face inadequate food and water,\" she adds.. Russian prisoners of war, too, have reported beatings and suffering electrocution.. \"Any form of torture or ill treatment is prohibited under international law,\" says Ms Bogner. \"It is unacceptable for either side to do this.\". The BBC was unable to independently confirm Konstantin Yefremov's specific allegations of torture, but they are consistent with other claims of abuse of Ukrainian prisoners.. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.. Mr Yefremov would eventually return to his de-mining unit, but not for long.. \"Seven of us had taken the decision [to leave the army],\" he tells me.. At the end of May, back in Chechnya, he wrote his letter of resignation. Some senior officers were not happy. . \"They started threatening me. Officers who hadn't spent a day in Ukraine were telling me that I was a coward and a traitor. They wouldn't allow me to resign. I was dismissed.\". Mr Yefremov shows us letters from the military.. In the first document, he is accused of \"shirking his duties\" and disregarding an order to return to Ukraine. It is described as \"a serious breach of discipline\".. The second letter refers to Mr Yefremov's \"early dismissal from military serviceâ€¦ for breaking his contract\".. \"After 10 years of service I was denounced as a traitor, a defector, just because I didn't want to kill people,\" he says. \"But I was glad that I was now a free person, that I wouldn't have to kill or be killed.\" . Mr Yefremov was out of the army. But not out of danger of being sent back to the war.. In September 2022, President Putin declared what he called \"partial mobilisation\". Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens would be drafted into the military and sent to Ukraine.. Mr Yefremov says he knew - because he had already served with the military in Ukraine - he would not be left alone. He came up with an escape plan.. \"In the house where I was living I made a hatch in the attic ceilingâ€¦ in case police and enlistment officers broke in to deliver call-up papers. . \"Enlistment officers were driving to my house and waiting for me in their cars. So, I rented a flat and hid there. . \"I hid from the neighbours, too, because I'd heard of cases when neighbours told police about young men who'd been drafted and were hiding. I found this situation humiliating and unacceptable.\"  . Mr Yefremov contacted Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, which helped him leave Russia.  . What does Mr Yefremov think about those Russians - and there are many - who express support for Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine?. \"I don't know what's going on in their heads,\" he says. \"How could they allow themselves to be fooled? When they go to market, they know they could be short-changed. They don't trust their wives, their husbands. . \"But the man who has been deceiving them for 20 years, he only has to give the word and these people are ready to go and kill and die. I can't understand it.\". As we end our chat, Mr Yefremov says sorry to the people of Ukraine.. \"I apologise to the entire Ukrainian nation for coming to their home as an uninvited guest with a weapon in my hands.. \"Thank God I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anyone. Thank God I wasn't killed. . \"I don't even have the moral right to ask for forgiveness from the Ukrainians. I can't forgive myself, so I can't expect them to forgive me.\". ",

        "subtitle": "",
        "content": "The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints - Taiwan and the South China Sea.. The deal, which in part reverses the US' departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. . \"There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,\" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. . \"The US is not looking for permanent bases. It's about places, not bases.\" . The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will \"allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges\", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. . The statement came after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. . The US hasn't said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don't count China.. , saying \"US actions escalate regional tension and undermine regional peace and stability\". . \"The United States, out of its self interests and zero-sum game mentality, continues to step up military posture in this region,\" its embassy said in a statement.. These days the US is seeking access to places where \"light and flexible\" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. . In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. . Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. . The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. . Roll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the MalacaÃ±ang Palace. . More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it's knocking on the Philippines' front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines' own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. . Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. . \"We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.\". \"We have very limited capability against the threat from China,\" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. . He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. . \"The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.\". But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. . The history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. . \"We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,\" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. \"The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There's a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.\". The US' return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country's left-wing groups. . While there won't be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. . The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.. The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. . \"The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,\" he says. \"It's buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels.\" . With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a \"rear access area\" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. . \"People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,\" Mr Poling says. . But Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China's rise, Professor Kraft cautions. . \"The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage.\" . Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. . In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China's state-run Global Times accused the US of \"setting a trap for the Philippines\" and \"trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China\".  . \"We are once again being caught in the middle,\" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. . \"The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.\" .
