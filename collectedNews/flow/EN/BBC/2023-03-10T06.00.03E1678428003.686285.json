        "content": "Watch: Armed police storm a building in Hamburg. Police say the gunman acted alone and is thought to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among the six or seven fatalities reported by German media.. As yet, \"there is no reliable information on the motive\", police say.. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelböge street in the city's Gross Borstel district.. Police say they found a dead person at the scene who they believe may have been a perpetrator and investigations are continuing.. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. . Officers who went in found people who \"may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally\", he said.. \"The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled.\". He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued.. \"All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals,\" Mr Vehren said.. The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, at around 21:00 (20:00 GMT) telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".. Residents nearby were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.. Hamburg's Interior Minister, Andy Grote, said on Twitter that police special forces and a large number of officers had been deployed to the scene.. Police have appealed to the public not to share assumptions or to spread rumours.. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement.. The denomination was founded in the USA towards the end of the 19th century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. The headquarters of the movement is in New York.. ",

The couple's break-up has not been formally announced. They have not been seen together in public since attending the US Open tennis tournament in New York last August. . Ms Herman, 38, had previously worked at the 15-time major champion's Florida restaurant, The Woods Jupiter.. A lawsuit she filed in October against a homestead trust held by Mr Woods has only now emerged. It alleges she was locked out of their shared home in Hobe Sound, Florida. . \"Specifically, by trickery, agents of the Defendant convinced the Plaintiff to pack a suitcase for a short vacation and, when she arrived at the airport, they told her she had been locked out of her residence,\" according to the court documents seen by the BBC.. The legal action says Ms Herman's personal possessions were removed from the property.. She also says that $40,000 of her money was \"misappropriated\", adding that representatives of the trust then made \"scurrilous and defamatory allegations about how she obtained the money\".. Separate legal documents filed by Ms Herman's lawyers on Monday in a court in Martin County, Florida, near where the couple had been living together, challenge her NDA with Mr Woods.. The civil lawsuit, also reviewed by BBC News, argues Ms Herman's agreement with Mr Woods is \"invalid and unenforceable\" due to the 2022 Speak Out Act, which limits the enforceability of NDAs in cases of sexual assault or harassment. . However, her legal action does not detail any such allegations.. Ms Herman, her lawyers say, is \"currently unsure what other information about her own life she may discuss or with whom\".. Her attorney, Benjamin Hodas, did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. Ms Herman had been regularly seen by Mr Woods' side in the past six years, including as he was recovering from a severe car accident that, it was initially feared, could end his golf career. .

        "content": "There are fears the vessel could soon break apart or explode, risking one of the worst oil spills in recent memory.. But on Thursday, the UN said it had purchased a crude carrier that would head to Yemen and remove the oil from the stricken ship.. \"The purchase of this suitable vessel... marks the beginning of the operational phase of the plan to safely remove the oil and avoid the risk of an environmental and humanitarian disaster,\" Achim Steiner from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said, adding that it was a \"major breakthrough\"..  said the ship - which it purchased from major tanker company Euronav - was undergoing routine maintenance in China and would arrive for the operation in early May.. \"A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen's Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions,\" it said.. The organisation added that a potential oil spill could cost up to $20bn (£16.7bn) to clean up.. The UN had been searching for years for a solution and appealed for donations. The planned operation is estimated to cost $129m of which $75m has been received and another $20m has been pledged, it said.. The stranded ship - the FSO Safer - was left abandoned off the port of Hodeida after Yemen's civil war broke out in 2015. It has not been serviced since.. It was constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and converted later into a floating storage for oil. It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.. The 376m (1,233ft) vessel holds an estimated 1.14m barrels of crude oil.. The Safer's structural integrity has deteriorated significantly since maintenance operations were suspended in 2015, when the Houthis seized large parts of Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government. The ensuing conflict has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left more than 23 million in need of aid.. Mr Steiner told reporters on Thursday: \"Let me be very clear - this is a risky operation and things could go wrong.\" He added that it could still be suspended if they fail to raise enough funds..

Mr Xi's power comes from him being General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.. Confirmation of his third term as president had been widely expected. The naming of a new premier and various ministers in the coming days is considered more important.. The new appointees are all expected to be Xi Jinping loyalists. This includes Li Qiang, who is tipped to serve as Mr Xi's number two.. Mr Xi has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests.. The so-called Two Sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into China's direction in the coming years..

The proposals came during a cabinet meeting near the site where 72 migrants died in a shipwreck last month.. Ms Meloni insisted she was determined to defeat people-smuggling at the meeting in the Calabrian town of Cutro. . \"Our response to what happened is a policy of greater firmness on the ground,\" she said, adding that Italy would act against smugglers on the boats and those in third countries who organised the trips. . The government has denied responsibility for the disaster, but Ms Meloni said that more improved and legal routes had to be opened up to allow migrants to safely reach the country. . \"I believe that another way to fight people smugglers is to send out the message that it does not pay to enter Italy illegally,\" she said.. Separately, she said countries who helped educate their citizens about the risks of using criminal networks to head to Italy would get preferential quotas for legal migrant workers.. Protesters threw cuddly bears at passing cars as the ministers were driven to the cabinet meeting in Cutro on Thursday. Some held up signs reading \"They could have been saved\".. Ms Meloni's right-wing government has faced criticism over the disaster in February, with questions raised over whether more could have been done to prevent it.. Most of those on the wooden vessel, thought to have carried 200 people, were said to be from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.. The ship is thought to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. Officials said said 72 bodies have been recovered and another 79 people survived, but around 30 are still missing. . ",

A statement released by his niece, Noreen Austin, on Thursday said he had died from heart disease.. As a child, the New Jersey native got his start by appearing in the Our Gang comedy series after his family moved to California.. With a career beginning in the late 1930s, he acted in classic film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and as the murderer Perry Smith in a 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood. . He also had a role on the NBC series Hell Town and was nominated for an Emmy for CBS made-for-TV movie Judgement Day: The John List Story. . Once considered among the greatest actors of his generation, his career never recovered after his arrest. . Mr Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was alone in the actor's car in the Studio City neighbourhood of Los Angeles when she was shot. . The actor told police he had left her alone to return to the Italian restaurant where they had just dined to retrieve a gun he had left behind, and found her dead.. Four years after her death, including a year of Mr Blake awaiting trial in jail, a jury in LA found him not guilty of her murder.. Many comparisons were made at the time to the trial of celebrity OJ Simpson, who had been acquitted for murdering his ex-wife in Los Angeles 10 years earlier.. He was later ordered by a judge in a civil case to pay $30m (£25m) to the children of his ex-wife - leading him to declare bankruptcy. . He unsuccessfully appealed, but managed to get the penalty sum halved to $15m.. Mr Blake always maintained his innocence.. He had four children during his life and was married to actress Sondra Kerr for 22 years before their 1983 divorce. . In 2017 he married longtime friend Pamela Hudak, but they divorced two years later.. ",
