        "content": "It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions. . However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push. . Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition. . Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion. . So, if Russia does launch another offensive, what will it try to take?. It's the eastern city which has been grabbing the headlines because of the endless conflicting claims over who controls it. . For now, Kyiv isn't hinting at a tactical retreat. It claims the Russians are suffering about 500 casualties per day as they stage relentless attacks. Ukraine reckons its own losses are not as high.. Regular Russian forces appear to have replaced mercenaries from the Wagner Group as they continue to surround the city. For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it. . If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals. . But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km). In a period where Russia has been making minimal, costly gains, the Ukrainians would have to be seriously overpowered, or taken by surprise. . After trying and failing last November, Russian forces have started launching attacks on the small town of Vuhledar, also in the Donetsk region.. It sits on the south-eastern curve of the current battlefield and is significant for Moscow for two reasons. . Firstly, it's close to the only rail line linking the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russian-controlled territories in the east. It's from Vuhledar that Ukrainian forces have been firing artillery at Russian supply trains. . Vuhledar is like Bakhmut in that for the Russians it carries more symbolic than military significance. Ukraine is convinced Moscow is going to chase its two main goals as quickly as possible. . Alongside capturing the whole of Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk regions), Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be looking to widen the land corridor he has seized between Crimea and Russia. . The capture of Vuhledar would certainly go towards those - but it would be more valuable to the Kremlin in a propaganda sense. Military milestones help the Kremlin to justify its \"special military operation\" back in Russia, as well as appease critics. . They also could provide President Putin with a political way out, if he can keep hold of what he seizes. . Away from the eastern front, the conflict line south of the city Zaporizhzhia is another direction Kyiv is worried about. . The concern is that Russian forces could push north towards the towns of Orikhiv and Pokrovsk (the latter is in Donetsk region). . If this were to happen, it would push back the firing positions of longer-range Ukrainian missiles which can strike deep into the land corridor Russia controls further south. . Given that American HIMARS have been able to travel up to 80km (50 miles), and are about to go up to 120km, the occupied cities of Melitopol and Tokmak are comfortably within Ukraine's range. . Moscow is also wary of a Ukrainian advance here too towards Melitopol. Kyiv has talked about the importance of the city before, saying its liberation would allow Ukraine to cut off Russian supply routes to Crimea. . However, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, has also admitted his troops don't have the numbers of equipment for such an attack.. This video can not be played. Building hit by missile in Kharkiv's Freedom Square. Despite being less than 25 miles from the border with Russia, Ukraine's second largest city in the north-east has never fallen into Moscow's control. . Like so many areas, it has been mostly torn apart from Russia's attempts to snatch it from Kyiv's control. Kharkiv's population has endured almost constant missile strikes and resulting blackouts throughout this winter. . Authorities say while there hasn't been an increase in nearby enemy forces, Russians have been shelling civilian areas more frequently. . Some officers in the local military have said they \"wouldn't be surprised\" if the Russians launched another attack, especially with the frozen ground.. While there is no guarantee Russia could take a city it has failed to penetrate over the past year, its capture would bring a significant strategic advantage. . Invading forces could seal the city off from Kyiv, which could prevent Ukrainian troops currently south of Kharkiv from retreating to the capital.. Ukraine's capital is still Russia's ultimate prize. However, this isn't 2022. . Last year, joint military exercises between Belarus and Russia turned into an advance on Kyiv when Moscow used its ally as a launchpad for its invasion. . At the start of this year there were fears of history repeating itself when both countries announced drills once more - this time in the form of \"defensive\" air force exercises north of Ukraine. . Belarus denied it had plans to join the invasion. Moscow rejected claims it had tried to force it. . Now, both the West and Ukraine seem to agree on there being no intelligence suggesting the capital could be under the threat it faced last year. Plus, Russia used its best-trained forces during its first attempt, when its goal was to topple the Ukrainian government. . \"We do not see formed assault groups capable of reaching Kyiv,\" said Ukraine's outgoing Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov.. \"Besides, it is impossible to capture Kyiv in principle. It is a large city with four million people, ready to defend themselves.\". If Russia indeed launches a large-scale offensive and gains momentum, Mr Reznikov's successor could give a different assessment.. ",

        "content": "He added people with \"homosexual tendencies\" are children of God and should be welcomed by their churches.. His comments were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland.. Archbishop Justin Welby and Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, travelled with the Pope to South Sudan where they jointly called for peace in the war-torn country.. It is the first time the leaders of the three traditions have come together for such a journey in 500 years.. Archbishop Welby and Dr Greenshields praised the Pope's comments during a news conference with reporters on board the papal plane as they travelled from Juba to Rome.. \"I entirely agree with every word he said there,\" said Archbishop Welby, noting that the Anglican church had its own internal divisions over gay rights. . Last month the Church of England said it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to be married in its churches.. Expressing his own support, Dr Greenshields referred to the Bible, saying: \"There is nowhere in the four Gospels that I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whoever he meets, and as Christians that is the only expression that we can give to any human being in any circumstance\".. During the news conference Pope Francis repeated his view that the Catholic Church cannot permit sacramental marriage of same-sex couples.. But he said he supported so-called civil union legislation, and stressed that laws banning homosexuality were \"a problem that cannot be ignored\".. He suggested that 50 countries criminalise LGBT people \"in one way or another\", and about 10 have laws carrying the death penalty.. Currently 66 UN member states criminalise consensual same-sex relations, according to ILGA World - the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.. \"This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God,\" said the Pope.. \"God loves them. God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\". Under current Catholic doctrine, gay relationships are referred to as \"deviant behaviour\" and Pope Francis has previously . .. But some conservative Catholics have criticised him for making comments they say are ambiguous about sexual morality.. In 2013, soon after becoming Pope, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but added that homosexual orientation was not.. Five years later, during a visit to Ireland, Pope Francis stressed that parents could not disown their LGBT children and had to keep them in a loving family.. ",

        "content": "Fighter jets brought the craft down over US territorial waters on Saturday and debris is spread over a wide area.. The US believes the balloon was monitoring sensitive military sites.. Its discovery set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend's trip to China.. The Chinese authorities denied it was used for spying and insisted it was a weather ship blown astray. . Admiral Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Sunday he thought the Chinese military might have launched the balloon intentionally to disrupt Mr Blinken's trip to China. His visit would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.. Adm Mullen rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\". . \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Republican politicians. meanwhile, accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered.. Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN it was a \"brazen effort\" by China to embarrass the president ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday.. Brenda Bethune, the mayor of Myrtle Beach which is near to where the object was shot down, said: \"I do have concerns about how the federal government can allow a foreign adversary to fly uninterrupted from Montana to our doorstep.\". She said she hoped the government would explain how this happened and how they will prevent it from happening again.. The high-altitude balloon - thought to be the size of three buses - was shot out of the sky by a Sidewinder air-to-air missile fired from an F-22 jet fighter. It came down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT) on Saturday. . US TV networks broadcast the moment the missile struck, with the giant white object falling to the sea after a small explosion.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. Martin Willis said he was visiting Myrtle Beach when he filmed the fighter jet shoot down the suspected surveillance balloon. . He told the BBC he couldn't believe what he was witnessing. \"It was really exciting. It felt very historic,\" he said.. Police have warned people in the area not to touch or move any debris they find. \"Tampering could interfere in [the] investigation,\" Horry County Police Department said.. The remnants of the object landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than officials expected - and is spread over seven miles (11km).. Explaining the decision to shoot the balloon down, a US defence official said in a statement, that \"while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon's overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us\".. China's foreign ministry expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US's use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft\".. In a written statement, the Chinese government said it would \"resolutely safeguard\" the rights and interests of the company operating the balloon and that it reserved the right to \"make further responses if necessary\".. Mr Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk.. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast and advised mariners to leave the area.. Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty.. US military officials on Friday said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted over Latin America. The same day, Colombia's Air Force said an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. China has not commented publicly on the second balloon.. ",

        "content": "Watch: BeyoncÃ© gets emotional on stage accepting record-breaking award. BeyoncÃ© made history as she won best dance/electronic album for her euphoric dance opus, Renaissance.. In doing so, she overtook Hungarian-British conductor George Solti, whose record of 31 Grammys had stood for more than 20 years.. \"I'm trying not to be too emotional,\" said the star, accepting her prize.  . \"I'm trying to just receive this night.\". She went on to thank her family, including her late uncle Jonny, who helped make her stage outfits before she became famous.. BeyoncÃ© has previously said his battle with HIV influenced her interest in dance music, and its historical ties to the LGBTQ community, on Renaissance.. Overall, BeyoncÃ© won four prizes at the ceremony - but missed some of the early presentations after getting stuck in gridlocked downtown Los Angeles.. \"I'm surprised traffic could stop you,\" joked host Trevor Noah. \"I thought you travelled through space and time.\". Despite her success, BeyoncÃ© was once again locked out of the coveted album of the year award.. She has now lost the prize four times, most notably in 2017 when her confessional masterpiece Lemonade was beaten by Adele's 25. . At the time, Adele used her acceptance speech to say BeyoncÃ© was the more deserving winner (although she held on to the trophy).. This year, Harry Styles took the crown, with Grammy voters recognising the slick, radio-friendly pop of his third record Harry's House. . In his speech, the British star downplayed the importance of the prize. . \"On nights like tonight, it's obviously so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music,\" said the singer.. \"I don't think any of us sit in the studio, making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these.\". However, he was visibly moved by the honour, adding: \"This doesn't happen to people like me very often, and this is so, so nice.\". Earlier in the night, the star also won best pop album - receiving his award with a kiss from Jennifer Lopez. . \"This album from start to finish has been the greatest experience of my life,\" he said. \"From making it with two of my best friends to playing for people has been the greatest joy I could have asked for.\". Billed as \"music's biggest night\", the Grammys are the industry's most prestigious awards.. Sunday's show was attended by Adele, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z Shania Twain and Stevie Wonder, with performances from Lizzo, Steve Lacy and Brandi Carlile.. British artists had a good night, with indie duo Wet Leg winning two prizes, including best alternative album; and Sam Smith receiving best pop duo/group performance for Unholy, a duet with Kim Petras.. Smith's prize was their first Grammy since 2015, when they won four trophies, including best new artist.. However, the singer let Petras take the microphone to mark another historical achievement.. \"Sam graciously wanted me to accept this award because I'm the first transgender woman to win this award,\" said the German-born singer.. She went on to thank the late, transgender pop artist Sophie for \"kicking these doors open\", and Madonna \"for fighting for LGBTQ rights\", before dedicating the award to her mother.. \"I grew up next to nowhere in Germany and my mother believed me, that I was a girl,\" she said, as Smith looked on with pride. \"I wouldn't be here without her and her support.\". The duo later gave a sultry, BDSM-inspired performance of their ode to infidelity, introduced by Madonna.. \"If they call you shocking, scandalous, troublesome, problematic, provocative, or dangerous you're definitely onto something,\" said the star.. Adele also won best pop vocal performance for Easy On Me, dedicating the prize to her son Angelo.. The singer told the audience she had written the first verse \"in the shower when I was choosing to change my son's life\", by divorcing her then-husband, Simon Konecki.. She added: \"I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it's very old school and very brave.\". Singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt was the surprise winner of song of the year - beating favourites Taylor Swift and BeyoncÃ© with her sorrowful ballad Just Like That.. Voters were undoubtedly moved by Raitt's tender lyrics, in which a woman mourning the death of her son finds comfort from the man who received his heart in a transplant.. \"I'm so proud that you appreciate this one,\" said the 72-year-old, accepting her trophy.. Bad Bunny opened the show in an explosion of colour, replicating a Puerto Rican fiesta in the aisles of Los Angeles' Crypto.com arena.. His medley of El ApagÃ³n and DespuÃ©s De La Playa was enhanced with pyrotechnics, dozens of dancers and a troop of . the \"bighead\" puppets that march down the streets of San Juan every January.. He later won the prize for best MÃºsica Urbana album, in recognition of Un Verano Sin Ti, which spent 13 weeks at number one in the US last year.. \"I made this album with love and passion, and when you do things with love and passion, everything is easier,\" said the singer.. Other performances came from Americana star Brandi Carlile and Lizzo, who gave a gospel-infused take on her current single, Special.. She later won record of the year for About Damn Time, and used her speech to honour Prince, who gave her an early break on his song Boytrouble. . \"When we lost Prince, I decided to dedicate my life to making positive music.\" She also paid tribute to BeyoncÃ©, calling her \"the artist of our lives\".. The in memoriam section gave an emotional send-off to stars like Olivia Newton-John, Irene Cara, David Crosby and Jeff Beck.. Kacey Musgraves played a heartfelt version of Coal Miner's Daughter in tribute to the \"Queen of Country\" Loretta Lynn; while Fleetwood Mac star Christine McVie was honoured with a performance of her signature hit, Songbird, by Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Fleetwood..
