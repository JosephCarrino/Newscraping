        "content": "The attack would also mark Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army. . Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk.. Eight others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said. . The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage.. \"The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,\" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. \"By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.\". Ukraine . to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks. . Mr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive.. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a .  which he said was necessary to ensure the country's \"territorial integrity\". . But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher. . \"Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,\" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. . Despite some heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region, the war has entered something of a stalemate in recent months since Ukraine retook the southern city of Kherson. . With the exception of the .  neither side has made major territorial advances. . But a Russian spring offensive - and a Ukrainian counter-offensive - has long been considered likely. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to \"undertake a decisive action\" and launch a \"big offensive\" in the east. . Mr Reznikov said Ukraine's commanders would seek to \"stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive\" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. . \"I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,\" he said, adding that Ukraine's forces \"cannot lose the initiative\" they have achieved in recent months. . The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would \"significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types\". . Mr Reznikov's comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. . But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.. \"That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,\" Mr Stoltenberg said. . \"And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.\". Meanwhile, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. . She added that Moscow's troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. . \"Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \"Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,\" she said. . Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. . \"There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. \"The situation is becoming even more severe.\". While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia's recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has .  that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group. . Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn't want to fight being shot. . About 80% of Wagner's personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.. ",

        "content": "The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints, Taiwan and the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. . The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will \"allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges\", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. . The statement came after Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. . The US hasn't said where the new bases are but three of the bases could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don't count China.. The deal, which in part reverses the US' departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. . \"There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,\" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. . \"The US is not looking for permanent bases. It's about places, not bases.\" . That is, it is seeking access to places where \"light and flexible\" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. . In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. . Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. . The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. . Roll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos - Ferdinand Marcos Jr or Bong Bong as he is popularly known - is back in the Malaca√±ang Palace. . More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it's knocking on the Philippines' front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines' own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. . Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. . \"We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.\". \"We have very limited capability against the threat from China,\" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. . He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. . \"The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.\". But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. . The history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. . \"We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,\" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. \"The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There's a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.\". The US' return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country's left-wing groups. . While there won't be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. . The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.. The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. . \"The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,\" he says. \"It's buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels.\" . With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a \"rear access area\" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. . \"People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,\" Poling says. . But Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China's rise, Professor Kraft cautions. . \"The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage.\" . Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. . In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China's state-run Global Times accused the US of \"setting a trap for the Philippines\" and \"trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China\".  . \"We are once again being caught in the middle,\" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. . \"The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.\" .

Two others aged 22 and 23 were found not guilty of being accomplices to murder but were convicted of lesser terror offences.. The 20-year-old attacker, who had Austria and Macedonian nationality, had been radicalised in Austria and had served 18 months in jail for trying to join jihadist group Islamic State (IS), which said it was behind the murders. .

Quiet by day, at night it is one of Vienna's liveliest night spots. The shootings began at 8pm. It was a warm evening, and many people were enjoying a final night out, ahead of a coronavirus lockdown in Austria. . The morning after, the steps of one traditional old restaurant were smeared with blood. One man, who was having dinner there, described how he and his wife had taken refuge in the cellar there, when the shots rang out.  . The interior ministry was strongly criticised for having failed to monitor the gunman even though they had been alerted to the danger. . The government, which admitted mishandling intelligence related to the attack, later brought in a heavily criticised anti-terror law, which allowed for increased surveillance and introduced a new offence of \"religiously motivated\" crimes. . Judges, rights groups and the opposition criticised the legislation.. ",

        "content": "The nearly four-hour search of the property related to a wider probe into the handling of classified documents. . The FBI has not commented on the search. As it was consensual, no search warrant was sought. . Mr Biden's lawyer, Bob Bauer, said the search was carried out \"without advance public notice\" in the interests of \"operational security and integrity\". . Following the search - which lasted from 08:30 to 12:00 local time - Mr Bauer said that \"no documents with classified markings were found\". . Some \"materials and handwritten notes\" that appear to date to Mr Biden's time as vice-president between 2009-17 were taken for \"further review\", Mr Bauer added. . The search is the latest in a series carried out at various locations, after classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center - an office space - in Washington DC in November. This was not made public at the time. . More documents were discovered at another of Mr Biden's homes in Wilmington, Delaware, in searches conducted in December and January. . The precise number of classified records recovered remains unclear - although at least a dozen were found during the January searches alone. . Mr Biden has said his team did \"what they should have done\" by alerting officials immediately, and that they are \"co-operating fully and completely\" with the investigation. . After the first of January's searches, Mr Biden told reporters the files were in a locked garage. . \"It's not like they are sitting in the street,\" he said. . The latest search comes a day after special counsel Robert Hur officially began his duties overseeing the probe into the documents. . President Donald Trump and former Vice-President Mike Pence have also been embroiled in controversy over the handling of classified documents.. In Mr Pence's case, a \"small number of documents bearing classified markings\" were found at his home in Carmel, Indiana, according to a letter sent to the National Archives by his lawyer. The documents were recovered by the FBI from a safe at the property on 19 January, with two boxes more delivered to the Archives on 23 January. . An August 2022 search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida uncovered dozens of boxes and about 11,000 documents, including about 100 with classified markings. . The search warrant came after attorneys representing Mr Trump had said all government records were returned. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he had declassified the documents taken with him.. The justice department search of Joe Biden's holiday home adds one more twist to a classified documents saga that has stretched on for nearly a month now and includes a special counsel overseeing the inquiry. . The FBI move could reveal how forthcoming and thorough the Biden team has been in reviewing the documents stored on his personal property. For the most part, the Biden lawyers have been conducting their own review of the president's personal residences without government investigators looking over their shoulders. While they found classified material at the president's Wilmington home, they have said that there were no such documents found at the president's beach house. . At the very least, the search will help quell some of the concerns expressed by Republicans that the government is holding Mr Biden to a lower level of scrutiny and suspicion than Donald Trump, who had his Mar-a-Lago estate searched by the FBI last August. When Mr Biden's lawyers first revealed they had found classified material at his home and personal office, the former president, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and other conservatives openly wondered why the current president wasn't targeted by government investigators as well.. Now, however, Mr Biden's defenders are pointing out that multiple Biden properties have been searched, but there is no indication that the FBI has investigated Mr Trump's New Jersey and New York homes..

        "content": "Five officers were charged last week over his death.. Relatives as well as national figures, including Vice-President Kamala Harris and actor Spike Lee, came to Tennessee to pay their respects. . During the three-hour ceremony that featured gospel songs and African drumming, those who knew Mr Nichols spoke of a kind and caring father who enjoyed skateboarding and photography, while many called for police reforms. . Rev. Dr J. Lawrence Turner, a pastor at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, began the service by mourning a \"son, father, brother, friend, human being gone too soon and denied his rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\".. Several other prominent leaders also gave speeches, including Vice-President Harris, who told Mr Nichols' family the country was mourning with them. . \"Mothers around the world, when their babies are born, pray to God when they hold that child that that body and that life will be safe,\" she said. \"Yet we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today.\" . She called Mr Nichols' death \"an act of violence at the hands and the feet of people who have been charged with keeping them safe\", and called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. . Graphic bodycam footage of Mr Nichols' encounter with police released last week showed him being brutally punched, kicked, pepper-sprayed and hit by police officers. . Mr Nichols was black, as are the police officers now charged with second-degree murder, assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and oppression. . None have not entered a plea, but lawyers for two of the men earlier said they would contest the charges.. The families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom died as a result of police violence, were also in attendance. . Mr Nichols' siblings remembered their brother as someone who touched many lives, including older sister Keyana Dixon, who said through tears that her younger brother was \"robbed of his life, his passions and his talents, but not his light\". . Mr Nichols' other sister recited a poem titled \"I'm just trying to go home\", a reference to what Mr Nichols' told police officers in bodycam footage. . \"I've skated across barriers designed to hold me back. I'm just trying to go home, where the love is loud and the smiles are warm, like the sunsets that come for me in the coldest of my storms,\" she said. . Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton noted Mr Nichols was murdered in the same city as Dr Martin Luther King Jr 55 years before. There's \"nothing more insulting and offensive\" than police officers beating their \"brother\" to death, he said.. \"If that man had been white you wouldn't have beat him like that that night,\" he said, pledging to never let Mr Nichols' \"memory die\". .  representing Mr Nichols' family, said police failed to see him as a human being. He said the world needed to secure \"equal justice\" for Mr Nichols. . He and other civil rights activists have argued police culture is to blame for Mr Nichols' death. . They have said Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis' swift response in charging the five police officers should be a\"blueprint\" for justice going forward. . Ms Davis has said the treatment of Mr Nichols \"defied humanity\". . Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, who spoke briefly during the service, also urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd policing act because \"there should be no other child that's suffered\" the way her son and many others have, she said. . The youngest of four children, Mr Nichols grew up in Sacramento, California before moving to Memphis in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic to be closer to his mother. He was a father to a four-year-old boy, and worked at FedEx with his stepfather Rodney Wells.. A photo slideshow played during the funeral displayed Mr Nichols' many life passions, including capturing sunsets on camera and spending time with his son. . ",

        "content": "Protesters and mourners clash outside George Pell‚Äôs funeral in Sydney.. The Catholic Cardinal died in Rome last month, aged 81, after complications from hip surgery.. Formerly one of the Pope's top aides, Cardinal Pell was Australia's highest-ranking Catholic.. But his public image was tainted by unproven allegations he concealed and committed child sexual abuse.. Inside St Mary's Cathedral, where Cardinal Pell served as Archbishop of Sydney for over a decade, dignitaries including former Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott filled pews.. Noticeably absent were Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet - himself a devout Catholic. Both sent delegates.. Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher led a requiem Mass, saying Cardinal Pell was a \"giant of the Catholic Church in Australia\" who had been wrongly demonised.. \"Even after he was unanimously exonerated by the High Court of Australia [of child sex abuse charges], some continued to demonise him. But many appreciate the legacy of this most influential churchman in our nation's history.\". And in a message read to the congregation, Pope Francis paid tribute to Cardinal Pell's \"consistent and committed witness, his dedication to the gospel and to the Church\".. Mourners who gathered in the cathedral square to pay their respects told the BBC Cardinal Pell was a kind man who went out of his way to support people through challenging times.. Nathan, 33, said he wants the cardinal to be remembered \"for the things he did and not for the things that he was accused of\".. But outside the cathedral square, child abuse survivors remembered him as someone who had failed to protect them. Some travelled from other states to tie ribbons to the church fence - a gesture seen in Australia as a tribute to victims of the Church abuse crisis.. Maureen, 75, came to leave a ribbon on behalf of a close friend, who was abused by a Catholic teacher.. \"I can't let today pass without standing for him. He is not well enough to stand for himself,\" she told the BBC. . And protesters gathering in parkland opposite the cathedral remembered him as a \"monstrous bigot\".. \"Pell stood for blatant homophobia, misogyny... covering up abuse within the Catholic Church,\" organiser Kim Stern told the BBC.. \"We think it's pretty disgusting he's getting a send-off like this.\". Also out in force were police, trying to temper simmering tensions.. At one point, they intervened to separate angry mourners from protesters holding signings condemning the cardinal to hell.. During a career spanning six decades, Cardinal Pell rose to prominence in the Church as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views on issues like abortion and priestly celibacy.. He worked his way through the ranks of the Church in Victoria, serving as Archbishop of both Melbourne and then Sydney, before he was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances. . As Vatican treasurer, Cardinal Pell was often described as the Church's third-ranked official.. But the cleric left his lofty post in 2017, returning to Australia to face trial on child sex abuse charges.. A jury in 2018 found he had abused two boys when he was Archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s.. Cardinal Pell, who always maintained his innocence, spent over a year in prison before the High Court of Australia quashed the verdict in 2020.. But even before he faced charges himself, Cardinal Pell's reputation in Australia was marred by the Church's failure to tackle its child sex abuse crisis.. As a leader, many Australians felt he bore some responsibility for the broader Church's concealment of abuse.. A landmark inquiry into child sex abuse in institutional settings found Cardinal Pell also personally knew of child sexual abuse by priests in Australia as early as the 1970s and had failed to act. Cardinal Pell disputed the findings, saying they were \"not supported by evidence\".. ",

        "content": "Ukraine has launched an anti-corruption drive and officials said the leaders of the customs service had been fired.. President Volodymr Zelensky said raids were necessary to ensure \"people do not abuse power\".. Speaking on Wednesday President Zelensky said: \"Unfortunately, in some spheres, the only way to guarantee legitimacy is to change leaders along with institutional changes implementation.\". Ukraine has come under increasing pressure from its Western partners, notably the EU, to tackle corruption. . When Mr Zelensky came to power in 2019 he cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities. . Kyiv is due to host a summit with leading EU officials this week, seen by Ukraine as highly important in its push for membership of the 27-member union. Kyiv was granted EU candidate status four months after Russia's invasion, but it was urged to do more to tackle corruption.. Ten leading Ukrainian figures resigned last week, as part of the purge, including Mr Zelensky's deputy head of office Kyrylo Tymoshenko. . Several deputy ministers and regional governors were also squeezed out. Mr Zelensky said at the time that any internal problems that hindered the state would be cleaned up to help Ukraine's \"rapprochement with European institutions\". . Mr Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine's best-known individuals and Ukrainian websites published pictures of detectives searching his home in the south-eastern city of Dnipro as he looked on.. The tycoon took on the role of governor of the wider Dnipropetrovsk region in 2014 and played a key role in funding volunteer battalions in response to Russia's initial landgrab in eastern Ukraine. . However, the US placed him under sanctions for alleged \"significant corruption\" during his time as governor. He has denied any wrongdoing.. Mr Kolomoisky is also a wealthy businessman involved in Ukrainian media, oil and banking. His TV channel gave Mr Zelensky his break with the comedy series Servant of the People, before he backed the former actor's bid for the presidency. . In a statement that made no mention of the tycoon, the economic security bureau said it had exposed large-scale embezzlement schemes and tax evasion worth 40bn hyrivnia ($1bn; ¬£880m) by the former management of Ukraine's two biggest oil firms, Ukranafta and Ukrtatnafta. . There was no initial comment from Mr Kolomoisky, whose companies had a substantial stake in both companies. They were among several strategic businesses transferred to state ownership last November. Weeks earlier, Mr Kolomoisky's flat was searched in western Ukraine.. In a separate raid, the former interior minister, Arsen Avakov, told Ukrainian media that his home had been searched as part of an inquiry into Ukraine's purchase of Airbus helicopters six years ago.. Mr Avakov was quoted as saying that nothing had been found and all the contracts had been approved at the time.. The move followed a deadly helicopter crash outside a kindergarten in a suburb of the capital Kyiv that left 14 people dead, including the interior minister, his entourage and a child on the ground. . Referring to the latest anti-corruption swoop as \"spring landings\", Mr Arakhamia listed further investigations, including the dismissal of the entire leadership of the customs service. MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the acting head and two deputies had been fired.. The main tax office in Kyiv was also raided.. ",
