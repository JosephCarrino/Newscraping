        "content": "No indication of aliens... I loved ET but I'll leave it there - WH spokeswoman. Search crews found \"significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified\", said US Northern Command.. The FBI is examining the items, which the US says were used to spy on sensitive military sites. . The US has shot down three more objects since the first one on 4 February.. \"Large sections of the structure\" were also recovered on Monday off the coast of South Carolina, military officials say.. About 30-40ft (9-12m) of the balloon's antenna are among the items found, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner.. US officials said the high-altitude balloon originated in China and was used for surveillance, but China said it was merely a weather-monitoring airship that had blown astray. . Since that first incident, American fighter jets have shot down three more high-altitude objects in as many days - over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory, and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border.. In the Lake Huron strike, the first Sidewinder missile fired by the US F-16 warplane missed its target and exploded in an unknown location, US media reported, citing military sources. The second missile hit the target, according to reports.. Each Sidewinder missile costs over $400,000 (£330,000).. Officials have said the slow-moving unidentified objects, all of which have been smaller than the first balloon, may be difficult for military pilots to target. . White House spokesman John Kirby said on Monday the three other objects were shot down \"out of an abundance of caution\".. They did not pose \"any direct threat to people on the ground\", but were destroyed \"to protect our security, our interests and flight safety\", he said.. The balloon shot down over South Carolina was described by officials as the size of three buses. . The second object, over Alaska, was described by officials as the size of a \"small car\". The third object, over the Yukon, was \"cylindrical\". And the fourth, over Michigan, was said to be \"octagonal\" with strings attached. . A Pentagon memo later reported in US media said the flying object shot down over Yukon appeared to be a \"small, metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it\". . Defence officials also wrote in the memo that the object shot down in Michigan \"subsequently slowly descended\" into the water after impact.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'What’s going on?' The mind-boggling balloon mystery in 61 seconds. The recovery of the balloon shot down on 4 February was delayed amid foul weather.  . Efforts are under way to collect debris from where the other objects were blown out of the sky.. Canada's federal police force said on Monday that the search area in the Yukon Territory was about 3,000 sq km (1,870 sq miles), including \"rugged mountain terrain with a very high level of snowpack\". . Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sean McGillis said there was a possibility the fragments from the Yukon and Lake Huron incidents might never be recovered because of their remote locations. . Canadian Armed Forces Major-General Paul Prévost said all three of the most recent objects to be shot down appeared to be \"lighter than air\" machines, and described the Lake Huron object as \"a suspected balloon\".. The military chief added that any members of the public who discovered debris should contact the police directly.. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is considering meeting China's most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, later this week at a security conference in Munich, Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media on Monday. . Amid the row over high-altitude aircraft, America's top diplomat cancelled a visit to Beijing that was initially planned for last week.. .. Use this form to ask your question: .

        "content": "The quakes in neighbouring Turkey are known to have killed almost 40,000 people in the two countries.. Many Syrians have been angry over the lack of aid to their war-torn nation.. The government of President Bashar al-Assad has blamed difficulties in rescue efforts on the impact of Western sanctions imposed on the country.. But international aid groups say the key impediments are the Assad government's mismanagement and refusal to engage with all areas of the country.. A UN Security Council agreement only authorises the use of the Bab al-Hawa border crossing for UN aid deliveries from Turkey into the opposition-held north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of \"cross-line\" aid.. More than 5,700 people are now known to have been killed in Syria by the 6 February earthquakes. In Turkey, the death toll has already exceeded 31,000.. More than one million people have been left homeless in Turkey, and in Syria this number could be much higher, aid organisations warn.. Rescue teams in both countries are now winding down rescue operations in the vast area, as chances of finding any more survivors are fading.. The UN made an announcement about the two border crossings - Bab al-Salam and al-Raee on the border with Turkey - after high-level talks with President Assad in Damascus on Monday.. It said the crossings into opposition-held north-western Syria would initially be open for three months.. \"Very shortly we will use the other two crossings,\" UN Secretary General António Guterres' spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme.. \"We hope that the agreement will last as long as we need to use it. We will start using it as quickly as possible and I don't want to make any assumptions, the only thing I want to assume is that people will put politics aside wherever they stand in this conflict.\". He did not give any further details on when the two crossings would open.. And Mr Dujarric defended the delay in waiting for Syria's permission to open the crossings.. \"It is our understanding that other aid organisations not affiliated with the UN have been using these border crossings. We have to operate within certain perimeters, that's the nature of the United Nations.\". President Assad has made no public comments on the issue.. In the first few days after the quake, some supplies reached the government-controlled areas of Syria, primarily from friendly countries like Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.. But the devastated opposition-controlled areas of Syria remain virtually cut off.. This video can not be played. Watch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horror. ",
