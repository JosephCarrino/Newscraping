Credit Suisse, which was founded in 1856, has faced a string of scandals in recent years, including money laundering charges.. It reported a loss of 7.3bn Swiss francs ($7.9bn; £6.5bn) in 2022 - its worst year since the financial crisis of 2008 - and has warned it does not expect to be profitable until 2024..

        "content": "For Maria Silvia and Francesca - and their four children Margherita, twins Giorgio and Raffaele, and Antonio - being finally recognised as a household after years of legal challenges and discrimination was \"truly incredible\".. This week, however, what was then seen as a major victory for equality and acceptance by the LGBT community was reversed.. Italy's right-wing government instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents, reigniting a debate around Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative agenda.. Hundreds of people protested against the government ban in Milan on Saturday.. The newly elected leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, was among them. She said her message to the prime minister was \"not to discriminate against the daughters and sons of these wonderful families\". . \"We are talking about boys and girls already growing up in our communities and going to our schools,\" Ms Schlein said. \"It is no longer tolerable, and these families are tired of being discriminated against.''. Ms Meloni, who leads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, made anti-LGBT rhetoric a cornerstone of her electoral campaign, promising to protect traditional values. . \"We were always a family, but being officially recognised as such by our own mayor made us feel welcome,\" said Maria Silvia Fiengo. \"Today, looking at what the government is doing, and knowing that other families won't be able to have the same opportunity, we feel discouraged.\" . Italy legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 under a centre-left government.. However, stiff resistance from Catholic and conservative groups meant that the law stopped short of granting adoption rights to same-sex couples as well. Opponents said it would encourage surrogate pregnancies, which are still illegal in Italy. . That left a regulatory vacuum surrounding several aspects of LGBT family life, including adoption. Solutions aimed at getting around bureaucratic hurdles were reached on a case-by-case basis, as cases went to court.. Some local administrators, including the centre-left mayor of Milan, decided that children of same-sex couples would be registered independently.  . Mr Sala has now announced he has been forced to halt the practice after he was sent a letter by the interior ministry. It cited a ruling by Italy's highest court requiring court approval for legal recognition of parental status. . \"It is a clear step backwards, politically and socially, and I put myself in the shoes of those parents who thought they could count on this possibility in Milan,\" said the mayor in his daily podcast Buongiorno Milano, adding that he was left with no other choice.. Children who are denied the right to have both parents recognised on their birth certificate are left in a legal limbo.. Their families face a range of challenges. In the most extreme scenario, if the legally recognised parent were to pass away, the children could become wards of the state and face the prospect of being orphaned. . In Italy's LGBT community, this has led to a growing sense of frustration and anxiety, while the Meloni government's hostile approach to LGBT rights has further exacerbated the issue.. \"Children end up having limited access to key services and benefits, such as healthcare, inheritance and child support,\" said Angelo Schillaci, law professor at Sapienza University in Rome. . \"At present, only one parent is recognised by law, the other one is a ghost. In real life, parents and children play together, cook together, play sports and go on holiday together. But on paper, they are apart, the state does not see them. It's a paradoxical situation.\" . The prime minister, elected last September, has been a vocal supporter of traditional family and Christian values, campaigning against what she calls \"gender ideology\" and the \"LGBT lobby\". Months before she came to power, she proposed a law that would make surrogacy by an Italian citizen a universal crime, and it is still on her party's agenda. . \"Boys and girls with two mothers and two fathers already exist in Italy, Prime Minister Meloni should get over it,\" said Alessia Crocini, president of the Rainbow Families association. \"We must guarantee our children the same rights as their peers.\" . \"We feel under attack,\" said Angela Diomede, who was planning to take part in the Milan rally with her wife and their six-year-old girl. \"I don't understand this obsession of the government with targeting children, it doesn't lead anywhere.\" . Italy's Senate this week also rejected a proposal for a standardised European parenthood certificate that would be recognised across all 27 member states of the EU.. For children, it would mean proof of parenthood and for parents it would be a guaranteed right to be recognised across the EU, protecting rights such as inheritance and citizenship. . But for Italy's far-right infrastructure minister, Matteo Salvini, it was a step too far. \"A person can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual: love is free, beautiful and sacred for all,\" he tweeted.. Riccardo Magi, an opposition MP in favour of the Europe-wide certificate, complained: \"The world goes one way, the [Italian] government goes the other.\" . The debate is being followed closely from the north-eastern city of Udine by Stefano Zucchini and his husband Alberto.. They have two six-year-old twins, who were born in California through surrogacy, and hope to be legally recognised as a family one day. In the US, they are both recognised as parents. But in Italy, Stefano is listed as a single father, and that legal status makes life complicated.. \"Even things that are normal for most people, such as driving the kids to the kindergarten or to a doctor appointment, can become a challenge,\" he told the BBC.. \"They don't see us, but our love is as strong as ever. That, for sure, exists.\". ",

        "content": "The anger and mutual incomprehension over President Emmanuel Macron's proposed reform of the pension age show how dangerously polarised the two factions have become.. The government says pushing back the pension age from 62 to 64 is vital in order to preserve France's much-prized \"share-out\" system - based on a single fund that workers pay into and pensioners draw out of.. With people living longer, the only alternatives would be to cut the value of pensions, or increase contributions from those in work.  . And both those options would be even more unpopular.. What's more, says the president, France is merely aligning itself with every other European democracy - most of which have pension ages even higher than the proposed 64.. But none of this seems to have gained traction with the public, who continue to reject the reform by a margin of about 70% to 30%.. Instead, people seem more inclined to believe the arguments of the left and far-right: first that there is no urgency because pension finances are not as bad as they're portrayed - but also that it's unjust.. On one side, many protesters are calling not just for an end to the reform, but actually for a lowering of the retirement age, back to where it was before 2010, when it was just 60.. On the other, voices from the right say that the Macron plan is already so riddled with concessions and exemptions, wrung under pressure during the long parliamentary process, that the savings it will make are now virtually meaningless.. In a functioning democracy the opposing arguments would surely find some form of compromise. After all, a majority of the population, while rejecting the Macron plan, also agrees that some reform of pensions is needed.. But is French democracy functioning? . Faith in conventional politics and the parliamentary system is in fact at rock-bottom. How else to explain the collapse of Gaullists and Socialists, who ran France for half a century, and the rise of the far-right and far-left?. President Macron encouraged the death of the . , that old order which he exploited to pose as the lone moderate, picking sensible bits from programmes of left and right.. Hyper-intelligent and hyper-keen he may have been, but France never liked him and he was elected, twice, by default. Because the alternative, Marine Le Pen, was unacceptable to most. . By eliminating the moderate opposition, he made the opposition extreme.. At last year's parliamentary election, he failed to secure a majority - making inevitable the use last Thursday of constitutional.  known as 49:3 to push the law through.. Meanwhile, the tenor of public debate was steadily debased. . The left tabled literally thousands of amendments to the pensions bill, making its conventional passage impossible. Opponents described as \"brutal\" and \"inhuman\" a reform which in other countries would have seemed perfectly anodyne.. One left-wing MP posed outside the Assembly with his foot on a ball painted with the head of the labour minister; fearing mob violence, a leading pro-Macron MP called on Friday for police protection for her colleagues.. With scenes of looting and urban violence, hills of rotting rubbish on the streets of Paris and other French cities, and the promise of more crippling strikes to come, this is the unedifying atmosphere as the country enters the next crucial phase in the crisis.. Following the president's invocation of the 49:3 procedure, opposition parties have tabled two censure motions against the government which will be debated this week. In theory, if one of them passes that would lead to the fall of the government, and possible early elections.. In practice, even the so-called \"transpartisan\" motion tabled by a centrist group in parliament - supposedly more liable to create a consensus between the mutually hostile far-left and far-right - would be unlikely to get the numbers.. If the motions fail, then the opposition can continue to battle the reform by other means: for example by appealing to the Constitutional Council, which rules on the constitutionality of new laws, or by trying to organise a referendum.. The government hopes that reality will at some point set in, and that most people will dejectedly accept the inevitable. . Quite possibly a sacrificial victim will eventually have to made - no doubt in the form of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne.. But for now, the mood is too ugly for that.  . In the immediate term, to every petrol depot blockaded, to every bin uncollected, and to every window smashed will be joined the accompanying refrain: \"Blame 49:3. Blame Macron.\". ",

Moscow wants Russian producers to be able to export more food and fertiliser to the rest of the world, but says Western sanctions are preventing them..

        "content": "Prosecutors have been looking at a possible indictment of Mr Trump. Reports say it could come next week.. If he is indicted, it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. This case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump's behalf by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.. It is one of several cases in which the 76-year-old is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted. . Past efforts to investigate him, including two impeachment trials, the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago raid, have tended to make him more popular with his base, so an indictment could have a similar effect.. It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged this week or even, beyond broad strokes, what those charges might be. . But with the former president predicting an arrest, and calling for mass protests, this is a journey into unknown territory.. Mr Trump has a loyal base of followers, and the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters following his repeated calls to protest has proven that a fraught situation can quickly escalate into violence.. On Saturday Mr Trump wrote on his social networking site Truth Social that \"illegal leaks\" from the Manhattan district attorney's office \"indicate\" he would be arrested on Tuesday. . The district attorney's office has not yet commented. Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said her team had not heard anything from law enforcement officials.. \"Since this is a political prosecution, the district attorney's office has engaged in a practice of leaking everything to the press, rather than communicating with President Trump's attorneys as would be done in a normal case,\" she said. . The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, has hit out at the investigation, calling it \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA [district attorney]\". . In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".. Any indictment would create a complicated calculation for Mr Trump's rivals within the Republican Party, as they decide whether to up their attacks on the former president while he is potentially distracted or keep their heads down and hope for the best. . If history is any guide, it will be the latter.. • . Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and ex-aides Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks, are among those understood to have given evidence so far. The Trump team has said the former president declined an invitation to appear, a sign the case is almost over, according to experts. Reports suggest one final witness could give evidence, possibly on Monday.. • . Once the investigation is complete, the grand jury votes on whether to recommend criminal charges. However, their verdict is not binding. Ultimately, it is up to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to determine what, if any, charges to bring. There is no deadline for this. It is a legal decision - what does he believe can he prove beyond a reasonable doubt to win a conviction - but also a deeply political one.. • . A former US president has never been indicted before but Mr Trump's lawyer said he would follow normal procedure. Typically, a defendant is either arrested or surrenders to the authorities - if they are facing a more serious felony charge they would be handcuffed. They then have their photo and fingerprints taken. After an initial hearing - called an arraignment - a defendant in a white-collar crime case like this is usually released until the next court date.. The Stormy Daniels case is about how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid Ms Daniels $130,000. The record for the payment reimbursing Cohen says the payment was for \"legal fees\". Prosecutors may say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, a misdemeanour in New York.  . US media organisations say law enforcement agencies in New York are preparing for the possibility of Mr Trump being indicted and appearing in a Manhattan courtroom as early as next week.. According to the Associated Press, they are considering the practicalities of taking a former president into court, including questions around security. . Donald Trump faces a separate criminal investigation over efforts to overturn his narrow loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election - though it is not known if the former president is being directly investigated. . The Department of Justice is also looking at whether classified government documents were handled incorrectly after Mr Trump left office, as well as broader efforts to undermine the results of the presidential election three years ago - including the 6 January attack..
