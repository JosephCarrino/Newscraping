        "content": "It says the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. . Moscow has denied the allegations and labelled the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move - the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and can only exercise jurisdiction within its member countries - and Russia is not one of them.. However it could affect the president in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally.. , the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. In the past, she has spoken openly of efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian children taken to Russia. . Last September, Ms Lvova-Belova complained that some children removed from the city of Mariupol \"spoke badly about the [Russian President], said awful things and sang the Ukrainian anthem.\". She has also claimed to have adopted a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol.. The ICC said it initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public in the event that it stopped further crimes from being committed.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told the BBC: \"children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported\".. \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be human being to know how egregious it is,\" he said.. Reactions to the warrants came within minutes of the announcement, with Kremlin officials instantly dismissing them.. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. \"No need to explain WHERE this paper should be used,\" he wrote on Twitter, with a toilet paper emoji.. However Russian opposition leaders welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Khan and the criminal court for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the decision was \"historic for Ukraine\", while the country's presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, lauded the decision as \"only the beginning\".. This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. But because Russia is not a signed member of the ICC, there is very little chance that Vladimir Putin or Maria Lvova-Belova will appear in the dock at The Hague. . The ICC relies on the cooperation of governments to arrest people, and Russia is \"obviously not going to cooperate in this respect\", Jonathan Leader Maynard, a lecturer in international politics at King's College London, told the BBC.. However Mr Khan pointed out that no-one thought . , the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, would end up in The Hague.. \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" he said.. Legally, however, this does present Mr Putin with a problem. . While he is the head of a G20 state, and about to . , Mr Putin is now also a wanted man, and this will inevitably place restrictions on which countries he can visit.. There is also a level of embarrassment for the Kremlin, which has always denied allegations of Russian war crimes, that such an influential, pan-national body as the ICC simply does not believe its denials..

        "content": "The musician and actor died suddenly of natural causes on Friday in his Los Angeles home, his publicist said. . Police were called to the actor's house around 09:30 local time (16:30 GMT), the publicist told US media. . \"Lance will be greatly missed,\" his publicist, Mia Hansen, said in a statement. \"Please respect his family's privacy at this time.\". Reddick had been in the middle of a press tour for the fourth instalment of the John Wick movies, which is slated to be released on 24 March. . He is also set to appear in the upcoming John Wick spinoff, Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas.. Reddick, a native of Baltimore, appeared in more than a dozen films and shows during his 25-year acting career. . He was Charon, the hotel concierge at a New York criminal underground hub called The Continental Hotel in the John Wick movies. He appeared in the original movie, its two sequels and is set to appear in the fourth instalment. . The actor was also known for his breakout role as Baltimore police lieutenant Cedric Daniels in The Wire, a series that ran from 2002 to 2008 and examined the narcotics scene in Baltimore from the perspective of law enforcement as well as drug dealers and users. . Reddick told the Guardian in 2010 that he thought the show would be a \"hit\" but did not anticipate it \"would become this phenomenon\".  . The actor was in the Resident Evil Netflix series and the science fiction-action movie Godzilla vs. Kong. . He was known for his voice acting work as well, including for the TV series Rick and Morty. .

The actor is survived by his wife, Stephanie, as well as a daughter, Yvonne Nicole Reddick, and a son, Christopher Reddick.. Reddick told the Los Angeles Times in 2009 that he felt like an \"artist at heart\". . \"When I went to drama school, I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a black man and I wasn't pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be,\" he said at the time. . His death comes two years after Reddick's co-star Michael K Williams, who played Omar in The Wire, died of an overdose. Last year, four people were charged for allegedly selling the drugs that Williams took before his death. . ",

        "content": "State officials said there was no immediate public health risk.. The leak was first discovered in late November, but state officials did not notify the public until Thursday.. The water contains tritium, a common by-product of nuclear plant operations.. A naturally occurring radioactive isotope of hydrogen, tritium emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far in air and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).. Tritium spills occur at nuclear plants on occasion, but are typically contained on-site and rarely affect public health or safety, the NRC says.. Xcel first discovered the leak on 21 November, from a pipe between two buildings at its Monticello plant. The plant is about 35 miles (56km) from the state's most populous city, Minneapolis, upstream along the Mississippi River.. The company said it had notified the state and the NRC the next day.. \"If at any point there had been concern for the public safety, we would of course, immediately have provided more information. But we also wanted to make sure we fully understood what was going on before we started raising any concerns with the public around us,\" Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. . \"Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,\" the Minnesota-based utility said in a statement on Thursday.. State officials said they had waited to get more information before going public with the leak, but confirmed that the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.. Xcel Energy said crews inspected the plant at all points where leaks could occur and will be examining the leaked pipe in a lab. . The Minnesota Department of Health has said the leak did not reach the Mississippi River.. Roughly one-quarter of the spilled tritium has been recovered so far, and Xcel has said it may build above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water.. It is also weighing how to treat, re-use or dispose of the collected tritium and water.. The company previously had a small leak at its Monticello plant in 2009.. ",

        "content": "The visit comes as Beijing, an ally of Russia, has offered proposals to end the war in Ukraine, to which the West has given a lukewarm reception.. Western countries have warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with weapons. . This will be President Xi's first visit to Russia since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. He is due to have lunch with Mr Putin on Monday followed by talks on Tuesday. . A foreign ministry spokeswoman said China would uphold \"an objective and fair position\" on the war in Ukraine and \"play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace\". . UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said that China playing a genuine role in restoring sovereignty to Ukraine would be welcomed.   . The fact the Chinese leader is going to Russia signals Beijing's strong support for Moscow. There's no surprise about that: Mr Putin and Mr Xi share a similar world view, both embrace the idea of a multi-polar world.. Last year the two men declared their partnership has no limits. That's not strictly true.. Up until now China has not supplied Russia with lethal aid to help it win the war in Ukraine, though the US claims China is considering doing so.. As for the declared partnership between Moscow and Beijing, Russia - with an economy a 10th the size of China's - finds itself increasingly in the role of junior partner.. So the Chinese government definitely has some sway over Russia. Other elements driving interest in this visit are Beijing's claim to be neutral and that it has not opposed speculation that it could act as an honest broker between Moscow and Kyiv.. It may not be a coincidence that Monday's meeting takes place on the 20th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, which was opposed by both Russia and China.. Crucially, China is coming off the back of a major diplomatic coup, having facilitated a deal for Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia to resume diplomatic relations.. However some argue that its stated neutrality is a sham and it is in Beijing's geopolitical interests for the war to continue because Russia is doing its dirty work - taking on the West and eating up Western resources and money.. China's proposals called for peace negotiations and respect for national sovereignty. But the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Xi - \"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said. . Some US media have reported that Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky will speak by phone after the Chinese leader's visit to Moscow, but this is yet to be confirmed.. Kyiv has been pushing hard for some kind of engagement. Ukraine believes President Xi is making the visit to send a signal to the world that Russia has at least some allies. . In an interview with the BBC before President Xi's visit was announced, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: \"I don't think China has reached the moment now when it wants to, when it's ready to arm Russia. Nor do I think that this visit will result in peace… The visit to Moscow in itself is a message but I don't think it will have any immediate consequences.\". The message, Mr Kuleba said, was \"that China and Russia are very close, close enough for the Chinese leader to visit his Russian counterpart, who is not doing very well. . \"And I think this is the message to the entire world, to the West but also most importantly, to the non-West, that Russia is not alone, that China is talking to them.\". The US is keen for Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky to be in contact. The US National Security Council's spokesman said it would be \"a very good thing if the two of them talk\". . On Thursday, China's foreign minister urged Kyiv and Moscow to restart peace talks as soon as possible during a phone call with Mr Kuleba, who in turn said the two had discussed the \"significance of the principle of territorial integrity\"..

        "content": "Slovakia's fleet was grounded last year and it no longer uses the jets.. Ukraine has asked Western countries for modern jets, but because of long training times, these are seen only as long-term options.. It sees extra aircraft as important for its defences and possible counter-attacks, a year into Russia's invasion.. Other Nato countries are considering sending planes such as the MiG-29 - a model which dates from the time of the Soviet Union - which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the plans, saying that the aircraft would not affect the outcome of Moscow's \"special military operation\", as it calls the war.. He said they would only \"bring additional woes for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people\".. \"Of course, during the special military operation, all this equipment will be subject to destruction,\" the spokesman added.. The Polish and Slovak pledges are a positive move for Ukraine - which has more pilots than planes - but will not make a decisive difference. . The Ukrainians say what they really need is . . . Yuri Sak, a senior Ukrainian defence adviser, says the fourth-generation fighters have better capabilities.  . It still seems unlikely that Ukraine would get them - at least for now, as it would take time to train Ukrainian pilots on Western jets.. Western military officers remain sceptical about modern fighters. Their focus is on helping Ukraine win the battle on the ground. . The front lines are swamped with air defence systems on both sides. The Russian air force is much bigger than Ukraine's and it hasn't been able to gain control of the skies.. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.. On Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted that . He said \"promises must be kept\" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for more weapons.. It is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are operational.. Mr Heger said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.. On Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.. As with its pledge of Leopard tanks, Poland has broken a barrier. This was a step no-one was prepared to take a year ago.. News of the pledges came amid Russian media reports that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had decorated pilots involved in an incident earlier this week .. Washington has condemned the Russian actions, in which it says one of the Su-27 jets clipped the drone, as reckless, but Moscow says the drone failed on its own.. This video can not be played.
