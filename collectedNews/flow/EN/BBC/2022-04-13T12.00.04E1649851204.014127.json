        "content": "On election in 2013, she became the first woman to lead the TUC - the UK's umbrella group for unions, which represents millions of workers.. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said she was a \"great champion for working people\" and her departure would be a huge loss.. A union official nearly all her working life, Ms O'Grady joined the TUC in 1994 after growing up in an active trade unionist family.. During the pandemic, she worked with the government on the furlough scheme, which saw workers receive a guaranteed income while huge swathes of the economy were shut down due to Covid.. During her career, she campaigned to introduce the national minimum wage, argued for rebalancing the economy after the 2008 financial crash, led on negotiations over working standards at the London 2012 Olympics, and pushed for more women to join the union movement.. Announcing her intention to step down at the end of the year, the 62-year-old said: \"Unions are a force for good in British society.. \"I am proud of what we achieved during the pandemic - from securing furlough to keeping people safe at work, championing equality and keeping vital services running.. \"The last decade has been turbulent - with three general elections, two anti-trade union bills, an EU referendum and a pandemic to contend with.. \"But on every occasion unions have risen to the challenge and fought for working people.\". Her replacement will be elected at the TUC's annual meeting in September.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate.

        "subtitle": "The former Tory minister had called Imran Khan's sex assault conviction \"a miscarriage of justice\".",
        "content": "Mr Blunt had called the verdict a \"dreadful miscarriage of justice\" in a statement on his website.. But he has deleted the message after Tory bosses said it was \"wholly unacceptable\" and has also apologised.. The Reigate MP said: \"I am sorry that my defence of him has been a cause of significant upset and concern not least to victims of sexual offences.\". He has also resigned as chair of a cross-party committee of MPs that campaigns for LGBT+ rights around the world, after several members of it quit in protest at his statement.. The official Conservative Party LGBT+ group has suspended him, pending an investigation and a membership vote.. , the group said: \"We are supportive of our judiciary and trial by jury, including the right to appeal, but present circumstances are that an MP has been found guilty of a grotesquely inappropriate sexual assault on a child.. \"Regardless of whether comments have now been retracted, Crispin Blunt's statement of yesterday [Monday] was inappropriate, misjudged and in the present circumstances we do not feel it is appropriate for Crispin to remain one of our patrons.\". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservative Party of being \"mealy-mouthed\" in its response to Mr Blunt's \"abhorrent\" statement on the verdict, adding that it should have come down \"much harder\" on the MP.. The BBC has contacted Mr Blunt for a comment, but he is not expected to say anything further at this stage.. Khan was thrown out of the Conservative Party after Southwark Crown Court delivered its verdict on Monday but he has said he will appeal against his conviction.. Mr Blunt, a friend of Khan who attended some of his trial, said in his now-deleted statement that he was \"appalled and distraught\" by the verdict, calling it \"an international scandal, with dreadful wider implications for millions of LGBT+ Muslims around the world\".. He claimed that the case against Khan had \"relied on lazy tropes about LGBT+ people that we might have thought we had put behind us decades ago\".. \"I hope for the return of Imran Ahmad Khan to the public service that has exemplified his life to date,\" he added.. He did not explain in any detail why he believed Khan's conviction had been a miscarriage of justice. . His statement was rejected by the Conservative Party as an attack on the independence of the judiciary.. Labour called Mr Blunt's criticism of the verdict \"disgraceful\" and said he should be suspended from the Conservative Party.. In his apology, Mr Blunt said he did not condone any form of abuse and believed in the \"independence and integrity\" of the justice system.. During his trial, Khan denied groping a teenager at a party in Staffordshire in January 2008.. Southwark Crown Court heard he forced the boy to drink gin, dragged him upstairs, and asked him to watch pornography before assaulting him.. Khan is set to be sentenced at a later date. . Before Mr Blunt's apology, several members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for global LGBT+ rights, which Mr Blunt chairs, had either resigned or said they would do so.. Labour's Kate Osborne, and three SNP MPs, Stewart McDonald, Joanna Cherry, and Martin Docherty-Hughes, also resigned from the group.. During the trial, the victim, who is now 29, said he was \"not taken very seriously\" when he made an allegation to the Conservative Party press office in December 2019, days before Khan was elected as Wakefield's MP. The victim went to the police days after the election.. Conservative sources told the BBC the party had found no record of a complaint being made about Khan in the run up to polling day. . Khan tried and failed to ban media reporting of the case, with his lawyers arguing that his life could be at risk, as the consumption of alcohol and homosexuality are strictly prohibited within his faith.. But a risk assessment by West Yorkshire police counter-terrorism security advisers concluded that there was \"no objective threat to defendant's life that would arise from being named as the defendant in these allegations\"..

        "content": "Douglas Ross said he shared the fury of the public over the \"unacceptable\" actions of the prime minister.. But he said it would be wrong to destabilise the UK government while the war in Ukraine was ongoing. . Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the PM's wife, Carrie Johnson, will also be fined over parties in Downing Street.. Downing Street has confirmed Mr Johnson's fine was in relation to an event he attended on 19 June 2020 to celebrate his birthday.. His wife and Mr Sunak were also reported to have been at the gathering, with an ITV report saying the prime minister had been presented with a cake while people sang Happy Birthday to him.. The fines are among more than 50 to have been handed out so far by officers from the Met, who have been investigating alleged Covid law-breaking at 12 gatherings in Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.. Mr Johnson is the first serving prime minister of the UK to be sanctioned for breaking the law.. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have both called for Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to resign.. But Mr Ross said in a statement that removing the prime minister would \"destabilise the UK government when we need to be united in the face of Russian aggression and the murdering of innocent Ukrainians.\". He said the public was \"rightly furious\" at what had happened in Downing Street during lockdown, adding: \"I understand why they are angry and share their fury. . \"The behaviour was unacceptable. The prime minister now needs to respond to these fines being issued. . \"However, as I've made very clear, in the middle of war in Europe, when Vladimir Putin is committing war crimes and the UK is Ukraine's biggest ally, as President Zelensky said at the weekend, it wouldn't be right to remove the prime minister at this time.\". Awkward doesn't really cover the spot that Douglas Ross finds himself in. His credibility is in question. . Having concluded the prime minister's position was \"untenable\" in January, before the police investigated - he's now arguing the opposite when Boris Johnson has been fined. . This about turn is not new. He made that the early stages of the Ukraine war, on the basis that the UK should present a united front against Russia. . Partygate has certainly united the opposition in demanding the PM's resignation, with some arguing the UK cannot afford to be represented by a lawbreaking leader on the world stage. . There's division within the Conservative party too, with former Scottish leader Ruth Davidson sticking to her view that Mr Johnson has lost the \"moral authority\" to govern. Awkward indeed. . This video can not be played. Mr Johnson has confirmed that he has paid the fine, and he apologised but insisted he would not resign over the matter.. \"I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better,\" he said in an interview, at his Chequers country retreat.. \"[But] now I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people.\". Reports that parties had been held in Downing Street during lockdown first emerged in December of last year, with Mr Johnson initially insisting that \"the guidelines were followed at all times\".. He later apologised for attending a drinks party in the Downing Street garden, but told Parliament he believed he had been attending a work event.. This admission initially resulted in Mr Ross saying the prime minister's position was .  and he wrote to the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs in January calling for a leadership contest. . But he . , arguing that calls for Mr Johnson to quit should be put on hold following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. . Mr Johnson subsequently attended the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen, where he was welcomed onto the stage by Mr Ross. . Mr Sunak was also asked in the Commons in December if he attended Christmas parties said to have taken place in 2020, and replied: \"No, I did not attend any parties.\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Mr Johnson had broken the law and \"repeatedly lied to parliament about it\", and must therefore resign.. She added: \"The basic values of integrity and decency - essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy - demand that he go. . \"And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him\".. Labour leader Sir Keir said the fines showed that the Conservatives were \"totally unfit to govern\", adding: \"Britain deserves better.. \"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public. They must both resign.\". Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay said Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were \"a disgrace\" and that \"if they have a shred of dignity left they will resign immediately.\". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said parliament should be recalled for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. . Campaigners from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group also said there was \"simply no way either the prime minister or chancellor can continue\".. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack issued a statement in support of the Mr Johnston, saying he remained the \"right person to lead this country at such a crucial time. .
