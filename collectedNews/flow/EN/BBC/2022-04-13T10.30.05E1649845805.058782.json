        "content": "On election in 2013, she became the first woman to lead the TUC - the UK's umbrella group for unions, which represents millions of workers.. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said she was a \"great champion for working people\" and her departure would be a huge loss.. A union official nearly all her working life, Ms O'Grady joined the TUC in 1994 after growing up in an active trade unionist family.. During the pandemic, she worked with the government on the furlough scheme, which saw workers receive a guaranteed income while huge swathes of the economy were shut down due to Covid.. During her career, she campaigned to introduce the national minimum wage, argued for rebalancing the economy after the 2008 financial crash, led on negotiations over working standards at the London 2012 Olympics, and pushed for more women to join the union movement.. Announcing her intention to step down at the end of the year, the 62-year-old said: \"Unions are a force for good in British society.. \"I am proud of what we achieved during the pandemic - from securing furlough to keeping people safe at work, championing equality and keeping vital services running.. \"The last decade has been turbulent - with three general elections, two anti-trade union bills, an EU referendum and a pandemic to contend with.. \"But on every occasion unions have risen to the challenge and fought for working people.\". Her replacement will be elected at the TUC's annual meeting in September.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate.

        "subtitle": "Prices went up by 7% in the 12 months to March, as food, fuel and energy prices continued to climb.",
        "content": "Prices are rising faster than wages and there is pressure on the government to do more to help those struggling. . The cost of living is expected to rise even further after the energy price cap was increased, driving up gas and electricity bills for millions. . Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%.. Fuel had the biggest impact on the inflation rate with average petrol prices rising by 12.6p per litre between February and March, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1990, . .. This compares with a rise of 3.5p per litre between the same months of 2021. . Diesel prices also rose by 18.8p per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.5p per litre a year ago.. The rise in the inflation rate was higher than the 6.7% expected by analysts and was also driven up by furniture, restaurant and food prices. . Since late last year, prices have been rising fast as pandemic restrictions have been eased and firms face higher energy and shipping costs which they have passed on to consumers.. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now adding to the pain, as the price of oil and other commodities climb higher.. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters and demand for oil from other producers has increased since the invasion, leading to higher prices. . Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise.. Ukraine and Russia are also the world's main suppliers of sunflower oil and the war has hit prices. . In the UK, the price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March, according to the ONS. . The inflation figures for March do not yet reflect the average 54% increase in energy bills that took place from 1 April when the energy price cap was raised.. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel.  . The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about £120 a month. . \"It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,\" Sara told the BBC. . \"But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?\". Sara said the family was also using less energy and has reworked its food budget to save money.. The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. . Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending £500 more a week on its energy bills. . \"We need to find an extra £1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,\" he told the BBC .  . He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to £1 extra to cover his rising overheads. . But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. . \"Next six months there'll be a lot of [restaurants] shutting down, they won't be making enough money to cover the costs of everything,\" he said. . This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace.. So, at home, families will be discussing how best to cope with this situation, which is expected to last a while.. In the words of the ONS, there were \"no large offsetting downward contributions\" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper.. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive.. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt.. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would \"continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year\". . He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing \"the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s.\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around £22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support fund.\". But Labour called on the chancellor to \"show the leadership the country needs\". . \"Labour has a plan to cut energy bills through a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits. Meanwhile, the Chancellor has increased taxes for working people to their highest levels in 70 years,\" shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said. . Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for \"unfair tax hikes\" to be immediately reversed and said people needed \"urgent help\" with energy bills. .

        "content": "Douglas Ross said he shared the fury of the public over the \"unacceptable\" actions of the prime minister.. But he said it would be wrong to destabilise the UK government while the war in Ukraine was ongoing. . Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the PM's wife, Carrie Johnson, will also be fined over parties in Downing Street.. Downing Street has confirmed Mr Johnson's fine was in relation to an event he attended on 19 June 2020 to celebrate his birthday.. His wife and Mr Sunak were also reported to have been at the gathering, with an ITV report saying the prime minister had been presented with a cake while people sang Happy Birthday to him.. The fines are among more than 50 to have been handed out so far by officers from the Met, who have been investigating alleged Covid law-breaking at 12 gatherings in Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.. Mr Johnson is the first serving prime minister of the UK to be sanctioned for breaking the law.. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have both called for Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to resign.. But Mr Ross said in a statement that removing the prime minister would \"destabilise the UK government when we need to be united in the face of Russian aggression and the murdering of innocent Ukrainians.\". He said the public was \"rightly furious\" at what had happened in Downing Street during lockdown, adding: \"I understand why they are angry and share their fury. . \"The behaviour was unacceptable. The prime minister now needs to respond to these fines being issued. . \"However, as I've made very clear, in the middle of war in Europe, when Vladimir Putin is committing war crimes and the UK is Ukraine's biggest ally, as President Zelensky said at the weekend, it wouldn't be right to remove the prime minister at this time.\". Awkward doesn't really cover the spot that Douglas Ross finds himself in. His credibility is in question. . Having concluded the prime minister's position was \"untenable\" in January, before the police investigated - he's now arguing the opposite when Boris Johnson has been fined. . This about turn is not new. He made that the early stages of the Ukraine war, on the basis that the UK should present a united front against Russia. . Partygate has certainly united the opposition in demanding the PM's resignation, with some arguing the UK cannot afford to be represented by a lawbreaking leader on the world stage. . There's division within the Conservative party too, with former Scottish leader Ruth Davidson sticking to her view that Mr Johnson has lost the \"moral authority\" to govern. Awkward indeed. . This video can not be played. Mr Johnson has confirmed that he has paid the fine, and he apologised but insisted he would not resign over the matter.. \"I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better,\" he said in an interview, at his Chequers country retreat.. \"[But] now I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people.\". Reports that parties had been held in Downing Street during lockdown first emerged in December of last year, with Mr Johnson initially insisting that \"the guidelines were followed at all times\".. He later apologised for attending a drinks party in the Downing Street garden, but told Parliament he believed he had been attending a work event.. This admission initially resulted in Mr Ross saying the prime minister's position was .  and he wrote to the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs in January calling for a leadership contest. . But he . , arguing that calls for Mr Johnson to quit should be put on hold following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. . Mr Johnson subsequently attended the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen, where he was welcomed onto the stage by Mr Ross. . Mr Sunak was also asked in the Commons in December if he attended Christmas parties said to have taken place in 2020, and replied: \"No, I did not attend any parties.\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Mr Johnson had broken the law and \"repeatedly lied to parliament about it\", and must therefore resign.. She added: \"The basic values of integrity and decency - essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy - demand that he go. . \"And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him\".. Labour leader Sir Keir said the fines showed that the Conservatives were \"totally unfit to govern\", adding: \"Britain deserves better.. \"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public. They must both resign.\". Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay said Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were \"a disgrace\" and that \"if they have a shred of dignity left they will resign immediately.\". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said parliament should be recalled for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. . Campaigners from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group also said there was \"simply no way either the prime minister or chancellor can continue\".. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack issued a statement in support of the Mr Johnston, saying he remained the \"right person to lead this country at such a crucial time. .

        "subtitle": "Community organisers want to see more black and Asian teenagers voting in the council elections.",
        "content": "\"A lot of young people are still quite disenfranchised from local politics and don't really know or have a say in decisions that affect them,\" said Nirushan Sudarsan, of the group.. Since February the group has increased efforts to get people registered.. Mr Sudarsan said councils played a \"huge role\" in many areas, including education, social care, health and housing.. \"It's really important that any decisions that people in power make, that young people's voices are at the forefront of that and that they they do feel that their voices and the votes are valuable in shaping and influencing them,\" added Mr Sudarsan. . In 2019, .  one in four eligible black and Asian people were not registered to vote in the UK, with the figure rising to almost a third among eligible people of mixed heritage.. In 2020 the voting age in Wales was lowered, enabling 16 and 17-year-olds to vote for the first time in the 2021 Senedd elections.. But .  previously showed that in 2021, at least 35,000 of the 60,000 young people who were eligible to vote in Wales did not register in time.. Citizens Cymru Wales describes itself as an alliance of organisations, working towards social justice.. In the run up to the May elections this year, members have been holding workshops encouraging more people from black and Asian communities to vote.. Mr Sudarsan, a 22-year-old politics student from Cardiff, has focused on community work in Grangetown, Butetown and the Riverside areas of the city.. He said: \"It's a lack of trust and being let down by the people in power and the political parties.. \"They see communities around them being affected negatively and they feel that things are not changing and that sometimes disempowers you from voting and making a change.. \"Being constantly let down hinders them from seeing voting as making a difference.\". He said representation was an ongoing issue.. \"The lack of role models and networks that they see within political parties and within public life also is a barrier - if you don't see yourself or someone like you who are in positions of power, you're less likely to see a change that you want to see,\" he said.. Part of the group's work has included holding talks at community centres, as well as in schools and colleges.. Mr Sudarsan said many young people he had spoken to cared about issues such as education, climate change, tackling racial inequality.. The drive has also included a social media campaign showing young black and Asian people encouraging their peers to vote.. Politics student Nadila Hussein from Fairwater, Cardiff, has featured in one of the videos.. \"Elections and politics in general are poorly communicated to young people and it's consistently just a lot of old people using really big words and jargon without breaking it down or simplifying it for those young enough to understand,\" she said.. \"I think that's only complicated more with local elections, because most people don't know what a councillor is. . \"There's that lack of basic education within society, in schools or at home where children are taught the importance of a local election or what a councillor is.\". This view is shared by fellow organiser Susana Dodoc, 22, who is training to become a primary school teacher.. \"Just make it simple because that's why it should be and that's how you get into young people's heads, just use minimal words and make it as simple for us to understand,\" said Ms Dodoc.. \"If they come in [to schools] and educate us properly on why it is important, children and young people will have a different view on why voting is actually really, really important.\". Although she does not want to go into politics she wanted to embed political awareness in her work.. \"Obviously I understand the curriculum is such a big thing but just embedding politics into the curriculum would be so important,\" she said.. \"If I can do that within my own practice and put it all together that would be a beautiful outcome, where I can educate young children on the topic within my full-time job.\". The hurdles of getting younger people engaged in politics is also a concern for the Welsh Youth Parliament.. Welsh Youth Parliament member Hanna Mahamed was elected to the role in December.. She said: \"A lot of my friends see a divide between us and them: the older generation of politicians who don't mention anything that directly affects us. . \"A lot of my friends don't want to watch the news as they say it doesn't directly affect them, so we are trying to bridge that gap.\". Ibby Osman, from Cardiff, is studying social policy and has worked with Citizens Cymru Wales from the age of 16.. He said: \"As a young black man growing up in such a populated society, full of white, upper class males representing myself and other young people in politics, it can be quite disheartening when our views are not heard, or issues that are massively impacting us aren't really addressed.. \"That's one of my key interests and that's what's really driven me to be more active, more involved and more engaged in this.\". He said he was working with health boards and politicians to highlight issues that young people had raised with him such as mental health, employment and educational opportunities.. He added: \"For a lot of young people, but adults as well, they fail to recognize that these issues are more devolved and are local issues rather than rather than UK government wide issues.. \"If they had better engagement and I think politicians were more direct and and more understood, then they can be a partnership and have more collaborative working to really solve the problems.\". Long-term, he has not ruled out a career in politics but said more change was needed in terms of representation.. \"It would be seen as something that's really tokenistic, that I'm just there because I'm a tick on a stats form for local council and local government,\" he reflected.. Mr Sudarsan said he felt \"cautiously optimistic\" the group's work would be effective.. He added: \"We're not going to drastically change the turnout come 6 May because it takes a lot of groundwork and real dedication to get to a level where turnout is really good.  . \"What we hope to do is build those relationships with people and do our part in driving and getting young people registered to vote.\".

The law which the prime minister himself said, while looking solemnly at us down a camera, was essential to our safety and which we must all obey.. The PM faced the cameras again on Tuesday to apologise for breaking those laws, while insisting it did not occur to him at the time that he was doing anything wrong.. \"But, of course,\" he added, \"the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation.\" . He tried to sound contrite, saying people had a right to expect better from their prime minister.. But he made it clear he will not be resigning, telling reporters he intended to \"get on with the job\".. Will this be enough to save his skin? . When Partygate dominated the headlines, many observers believed it was only a matter of time before Tory MPs triggered a no confidence vote in him.. But that sense of momentum has evaporated to some extent.. Firstly, and potentially importantly, there aren't many MPs around. It is the Easter break. The chance to plot, to gossip, to fume, to agitate isn't there.. Sure there are WhatsApp groups, but they are not quite the same.. But secondly, and more importantly, the context has changed.. War has broken out in Europe; our television screens are dominated by the horrific images we see every day from Ukraine.. Who did or didn't drink a glass of wine, where and with whom months and months ago in lockdowns so many of us are desperate to put behind us can, to some, seem trivial, parochial in that context.. In recent weeks, some Conservative MPs have made it known they had withdrawn their letters saying they had no faith in Boris Johnson's leadership.. That momentum I was talking about felt like it was draining out of the issue.. The big question, then - is what happens now?. Could Conservative MPs, talking to voters ahead of next month's local elections, encounter a tidal wave of anger from constituents that makes them think again about the prime minister's future?. Or have a crucial chunk of voters moved on too?. What will be the verdict of voters next month, and to what extent would that be able to be pinned on Partygate anyway?. Politics is at its keenest and its most compelling when the biggest questions are uncertain; where, whatever the speculation - and there'll be plenty - the next public actions and decisions of Westminster's biggest players aren't obvious.. Make no mistake: this is uncharted territory. For the very first time, it is publicly known that the prime minister and the chancellor broke the very laws they put in place, in the very place where they were devised.. Even if Conservative MPs don't have the appetite to remove Boris Johnson now, even if the electorate's verdict next month isn't clear, this is a line from the prime ministerial CV he will never shift.. A prime minister who's built a career on being unorthodox and has survived the apparently politically unsurvivable before, finds the dice rolling again.. As a pollster put it to me the other day, political events can be classified as turning points or talking points.. The vast majority are the latter, noisy, but of little long-term consequence.. This could still have the potential to be the former, even if nothing changes immediately.. The best British baddies in Hollywood blockbusters. Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate.
