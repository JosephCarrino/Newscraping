The arrest came after a complaint from his friend, Sindiso Nkatazo, also 31, police said . . They also said the damaged property was valued at $12,000 (£10,000). .

In court, his lawyer Ashiel Mugiya argued that the prosecutors had not done a thorough investigation and suggested an out-of-court settlement as Mr Mugabe junior and the complainant are friends.. If these negotiations fail, the former president's son will be summoned back to court, Mr Muyiga said. He added that the charges of assault against an officer and resisting arrest were likely to be dropped.. Former President Robert Mugabe died in 2019 at the age of 95, two years after being forced to resign following 37 years in power. He led the 1970s fight against white-minority rule in what used to be called Rhodesia but was later accused of using violence to win elections and destroying Zimbabwe's economy.. It is extremely unlikely that his son would have been arrested if his father was still president, analysts say.. Mr Mugabe was replaced by his former right-hand man Emmerson Mnangagwa.. Relations between him and the Mugabe family had been fraught after they accused him of betraying Zimbabwe's long-time leader.. His widow, Grace, had harboured ambitions of succeeding her husband but was sidelined by supporters of Mr Mnangagwa.. However, Mr Mugabe junior has since reconciled with President Mnangagwa and last year attended a rally where he was publicly welcomed back into the ruling Zanu-PF party.. ",

        "content": "Mr Biden's first trip to Ukraine as president came days before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion.  . He said President Putin had been \"dead wrong\" to think Russia could outlast Ukraine and its Western allies.. He met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the pair visited a memorial to soldiers who have died in the nine years since Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces captured parts of the eastern Donbas region. . Mr Biden's presence was intended to reaffirm America's \"unwavering commitment to Ukraine's democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity\", according to a White House statement. . The New York Times reported that he took a 10-hour train journey from Poland to reach Kyiv. . He left Ukraine on Monday to travel to Poland.. After the visit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new package of security assistance for Ukraine valued at $450m (£373m), including ammunition for howitzers and the Himars rocket system, Javelin missiles, and air surveillance radars. . The US will also provide Kyiv with an extra $10m (£8.3m) in emergency assistance \"to keep Ukraine's energy infrastructure up and running\", Mr Blinken said.. A new wave of sanctions against individuals and companies \"that are trying to evade or backfill Russia's war machine\" will also be announced later this week. . Mr Zelensky said: \"The results of this visit will surely be seen and will surely be reflected on the battlefield in liberating our territories.\". He also said that the two leaders had discussed the possibility of sending other weapons that so far had not been supplied.. Mr Zelensky has repeatedly called for F-16 fighter jets, something the . .. National security adviser Jake Sullivan - who was among President Biden's entourage - said the US notified Russia about the trip a few hours before President Biden's departure for \"deconfliction purposes\". . He refused to comment on how Moscow had responded to the news. . White House officials said planning for the trip had been happening for \"months\", and that a final decision to travel was made on Friday. . In a scene that added drama to the most high-profile visit to Ukraine since the war began, air raid sirens wailed while President Biden and Mr Zelensky were in St Michael's Cathedral in central Kyiv. The sirens sound regularly in Kyiv.. While other world leaders have visited Ukraine over the past year, the US president's appearance in the capital during a war in which American soldiers aren't fighting is a show of unity at a time when Russia says Western support for Ukraine is waning.. The visit was welcomed by Ukrainians in Kyiv. . \"I'm so grateful for his support - it means so much to us,\" Roksoliana Gera told the BBC. . \"I appreciate his courage, that he took on this challenge and came to show the support of the American nation.\". Oleksandra Soloviova said the visit was an \"important sign for the whole world\".. \"For Russia first of all, it shows the US supports us and will continue supporting us, with sanctions and military equipment,\" she said.. The Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said that the visit had been strategic as well as historic. \"Many issues are being solved and those that have stalled will be accelerated,\" he said.. The US is one of Ukraine's biggest allies and has so far announced $24.9bn (£20.6bn) in military assistance, according to the US state department. .

Dozens of people are missing and while the number of dead is expected to rise, rescue workers say they hope to pull some of those trapped in flooded homes out of the mud alive.. Video showed neighbourhoods under water, inundated motorways and debris left after houses were swept away.. Carnival celebrations have been cancelled in a number of cities. . In the coastal town of São Sebastião, 627mm of rain fell in 24 hours, twice the expected amount for the month. . The town's mayor, Felipe August, said the situation there was chaotic: \"We have not yet gauged the scale of the damage. We are trying to rescue the victims.\". Some 50 houses had collapsed and were washed away, Mr Augusto added, saying that the situation remained \"extremely critical\"..

Carnival events were cancelled across parts of the coastline, which is a popular destination for wealthy tourists looking to avoid huge streetside festivities in the big cities. . The festival usually lasts for five days in the run-up to the Christian festival of Lent and the colourful celebrations are synonymous with Brazil. .

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was spending the carnival weekend in the north-eastern state of Bahia, will visit the affected areas later on Monday. .

The statue of limitations for reporting rape will also be increased to 15 from 10 years.. Currently, Japan has the lowest age of consent in developed countries, and the lowest in the G7 group. . In Germany and Italy the age is 14, in Greece and France it is 15 and in the UK and many US states it is 16. . The current law in Japan means victims of rape need to prove that there was \"violence and intimidation\" used during the rape and that it was \"impossible to resist\" to secure a conviction. . The panel has not changed this wording but instead added other factors including intoxication, drugging, being caught off guard and psychological control into the definition. . Justice Ministry official Yusuke Asanuma said that this \"isn't meant to make it easier or harder\" for victims to win a rape case but that it should make verdicts \"more consistent\". . The re-examination of the sex crime laws comes after widespread demonstrations in 2019 following a number of acquittals. One case saw a man go free after being accused of having sex with his teenaged daughter, even though the court agreed that it was against her will. He was later sent to prison after prosecutors appealed. . Another saw a man found not guilty of raping a woman who had passed out from drinking because he \"misunderstood\" that she consented to having sex. . The government could pass the law as early as summer. Despite the potential change to the age of consent, an exception will still exist for intercourse between people who are at least 13 and who have an age gap of less than five years. . ",

Energy bills here now consume more than 70% of household income, according to Moldova's president.. Ala tells me they swallow half of her pension.. \"When we elected this government, they promised to raise salaries and pensions, but so far we haven't seen a penny,\" she says.. Sunday's protests, organised by Moldova's pro-Russian Sor party, are being closely watched by governments across Europe and beyond. Most protesters travelled to the capital city Chisinau by bus, with their costs reportedly covered by the Sor party. . Days before the gathering took place, President Maia Sandu warned that .  disguised as civilians, to topple her pro-Western government.. Russia has said the accusation is an attempt by Moldovan authorities to distract attention from their own social and economic failures.. Moldova, strategically located on the border with Ukraine, and harbouring its own pro-Russian breakaway region, is dependent on Russian gas.. Last year Moscow cut its supply to Moldova by half, putting pressure on the government in Chisinau, as it seeks to hold together its Romanian and Russian-speaking populations.. Protests over the rising price of gas and electricity began last autumn.. Speaking at a public briefing last Monday, President Sandu said that Russia had already attempted to destabilise the situation in Moldova via the energy crisis, which she said \"was expected to cause major discontent among the population and lead to violent protests\".. The plan now, she said, involved \"diversionists with military training […] who would undertake violent action, carry out attacks on buildings of state institutions or even take hostages\".. Fifty-seven people from nations friendly to Russia - including a group of Serbian football fans and several boxers from Montenegro - were denied entry to Moldova in the past few days, after checks by security services. . And Moldova's airspace was unexpectedly closed for several hours this week.. \"It's very clear that Russia is an aggressor state,\" Rosian Vasiloi, head of Moldova's border police, told the BBC. He said the threat had existed since 24 February, when the Ukraine war began, but he emphasised that it was \"different now; it's a mix of threats from inside and outside Moldova\".. As long as Ukraine continues to fight, and wins the war, he believes the risks for Moldova are lower.. \"If Ukraine falls, Moldova is next,\" he said. \"But I'm not afraid.\". Since the war began, President Sandu's government has tried to diversify the country's energy sources, and wean it off dependence on Russian gas, but attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure and the cost of importing electricity from Romania hasn't made that easy.. She has said the alleged Russian plot would rely on \"internal forces\" such as the opposition Sor party, and has called for parliament to pass tougher security laws.. The Sor party is led by Ilan Shor, a fugitive businessman who is currently in Israel after being convicted of involvement in the theft of $1bn from Moldova's banking system. He was sanctioned by the US and UK last October.. Marina Tauber, Sor's general secretary, who led today's protest outside parliament, says that her party is not opposed to the EU and wants good relations with all sides.. But there are those in the party who admit they would welcome Russian intervention.. Orhei - an hour's drive north of the capital Chisinau - is a Sor stronghold where we meet party Councillor Iurie Berenchi.. \"We're not afraid,\" he told me, \"Because if Russia wanted to take Moldova, they'd do it in half a day.\". When asked if he would welcome that, Mr Berenchi is unequivocal.. \"In my personal opinion, yes,\" he said. \"With Russia we'd be much better off than we are now.\". Many people in Chisinau see closer ties with the West as a way to secure Moldova's independence and democracy at a critical time. President Sandu's party has a solid majority in parliament.  . But the view from the crowd outside that parliament on Sunday was different, and there's the risk the pressure could widen the splits in Moldova's diverse society. . The risk is clear when Ala and her friends were asked whether they believe Russia wants to infiltrate Moldova, as their president fears.. \"Yes, let them come!\" they shout.  \"We want them to come here. We want to be part of Russia!\". ",

        "content": " as \"unprecedented in modern times\".. They say previous presidential trips to wartime Iraq and Afghanistan had the back up of a heavy US military presence.. And despite widespread speculation among the press corps that Mr Biden might be planning a trip to Ukraine while he was in Poland, the visit still took everyone completely by surprise.. The sight of him appearing beside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the heart of Kyiv and under the sound of air raid sirens, makes a louder statement than anything he can say in a speech in Poland. . \"It was risky and should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that Joe Biden is a leader who takes commitment seriously,\" said White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.. Mr Biden had been scheduled to fly out from the US to Warsaw on Monday evening, for a two-day trip. . The advance schedule had two suspiciously lengthy gaps in his itinerary, and many wondered if that might be when he would slip into Ukraine. . Reporters at the daily White House press briefings have been repeatedly asking about a visit. We were told that there was no meeting scheduled with Mr Zelensky and no stops planned outside Warsaw \"right now\". . The final decision to make the trip to Kyiv was only taken on Friday, even though it had been planned for months with a handful of the presidents' top aides. . On Sunday, the official White House schedule still showed the president taking off for Warsaw at 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT) on Monday evening. In fact, Air Force One took off at 04:15 EST on Sunday morning. . On board was a deliberately small team of his closest aides, a medical team and security officers.. Only two journalists were allowed to travel with the president. They were sworn to secrecy and had their mobile phones taken away from them. They were not allowed to report the visit until after Mr Biden had arrived in Kyiv. . Russia was notified of the trip a few hours before Mr Biden's departure, according to the US national security adviser Jake Sullivan. . He said the US \"did so for deconfliction purposes… I won't get into how they responded or what the precise nature of our message was, but I can confirm we provided that notice\". . President Biden then spent 10 hours on a train to get to Kyiv. He could have visited other locations inside Ukraine that would have been easier to get to, but he wanted to make the symbolic trip to Kyiv itself. . While the president's trip is a signal to Moscow of the Biden administration's commitment to helping Ukraine, it is also a demonstration to US voters back home.. His press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was asked last week about polls that show American support Ukraine softening.. She answered that whenever the president speaks, he is talking to the American people as well as people around the world. Monday's message is designed to vividly counter the minority of Republican voices who question for how long the US can continue supporting Ukraine. . Meanwhile, the surprise visit has left reporters like me, who thought they were travelling with Mr Biden later on Monday, making the trip to Poland on an aircraft that will not be called Air Force One. . The world-famous call sign is only used when the president is on board.. ",
