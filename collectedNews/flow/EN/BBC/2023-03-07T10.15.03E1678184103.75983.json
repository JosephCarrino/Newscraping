        "content": "\"You are not thinking about what you need to do,\" he says. \"You do it because you want to live.\". Illya survived because he was able to crawl out and be evacuated by his comrades. He has since had several operations and skin transplants for his burns, and his right leg had to be amputated below the knee.. Six months later, he still contemplates his life-changing injuries.. \"I had both disappointments and hope,\" he says. \"The hardest stage of my treatment is behind me. I dream about walking soon.\". Before the war Illya was an estate agent from Vinnytsya, in central Ukraine. A keen runner, he finished a marathon in 2021 and planned to compete in more. He signed up to fight just days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February last year.. \"You should not underestimate yourself but also you should not pity yourself,\" he adds. \"Everything is still ahead of me. I'm alive and healthy. It's not the end.\". Lviv's general hospital is one of 244 across Ukraine which take in injured soldiers and civilians, treating them for physical and psychological wounds.. Men in military uniforms mix with members of the public. Subtle hints that these aren't normal times.. The deeper you go into the building, the more pronounced those clues become. Mostly young men fill the corridors - the majority are missing limbs.. In a war defined by artillery, the most common injuries are from exploding shells, according to Ukraine's health ministry.. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in two Ukrainians needed some form of rehabilitation before the invasion last year, when the country had already seen eight years of fighting in the east. The pandemic has also been partly blamed by the WHO.. Russia's full-scale invasion has dramatically increased the need for rehabilitation services across Ukraine. . Money from international allies and local sponsors has paid for the state-of-the-art gym these men are being trained in.. Despite investment, Ukraine's health system is under strain.. Officials say they're struggling to deal with antibiotic resistance as hospitals become overcrowded with civilians and soldiers.. Cancer diagnoses and mental health provision have also been affected by prioritising wounded personnel.. Vasyl Strilka, who's in charge of physical rehabilitation at Ukraine's health ministry, admits more patients are dying because of cancelled operations and delayed cancer treatments.. While nine years of Russian aggression has left the country well-practised in treating injured soldiers, Mr Strilka says the quality of treatment they get can vary.. \"There are some hospitals where doctors provide good rehabilitation,\" he tells me. \"There are also some where doctors have not had any experience, and their care is not good enough.\". As the soldiers are put through core stability exercises, their stares into the distance reflect the brutal fighting they've emerged from. Health officials say that because they are  having to prioritise physical trauma, there is a growing mental health crisis across the population.. Despite all these hurdles, there are people who show a return to a fuller life is possible.. On a bitterly cold Kyiv morning, the sight of Hlib Stryzhko jogging with his friends is a moving one.. We last saw him in May, when he was lying in a hospital bed with a broken pelvis and jaw.. He was injured while defending the south-eastern city of Mariupol early in the invasion. Despite then being captured, he somehow made it home.. He'd always said he wanted to return to the front line. However, after losing sight in one eye, he's been told his military days are over.. Now Hlib works at a veterans hub, organising events and lectures for other former soldiers.. \"I struggled for a long time,\" he says. \"Sadly, my unit doesn't exist any more as I knew it. Those who served there with me were either killed or captured.. \"I then realised I wasn't betraying them by not returning.\". The soldier says he's grateful to the psychologist who helped him deal with flashbacks, as well as the sense of guilt and loneliness.  . \"I had some challenges, like fully acknowledging all of the horrors I survived,\" he says, \"as well as all of the wonderful things of this war, like the support of my friends.\". The healing process for Ukraine's soldiers is made all the more difficult with the continued fighting.. This 26-year-old shows it is still possible, despite everything.. ",

        "content": "It is the sixth day of strikes and protests since mid-January, and unions say it will be the biggest yet.. More than one million people are expected at demonstrations in Paris and other cities.. With the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader has said there is talk is of escalation and \"bringing the country to its knees\".. In the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes in key sectors like power generation and gas terminals.. So far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy, and in the meantime the bill is proceeding through parliament.. Unions and the left know time is running out before the reform becomes a fait accompli - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now.. The majority of French citizens back the ongoing strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform, a poll by French survey group Elabe suggests.. According to the opinion poll, 56% of people support rolling strikes and 59% back the call to bring the country to a standstill.. Two-thirds of people support the protest movement against the government's planned pension reforms in general, the poll indicates.. President Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council.. Government spokesman Olivier VÃ©ran told France 2: \"We don't want French people to be, quote, unquote, 'victims' of a long-term blockade.\". Last week, he warned that the strikes could lead to an \"ecological, agricultural and health catastrophe\".. More than 260 demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday, with up to 1.4 million people expected to attend, a police source told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity.. Neighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age to 65 or above to reflect longer life expectancy.. ",

        "content": "Unicef estimates that more than one billion women and adolescent girls worldwide are malnourished.. It says recent crises including war and Covid have made it increasingly hard for them to get the food they need.. Unicef has urged the international community to make food security a priority, including supporting failing nutrition programmes. . It stressed the impact the malnutrition is having on children's health..  found that the one billion undernourished women and adolescent girls were \"underweight and of short stature\" as a result, according to data analysis of women in most countries in the world.. It also found that they suffered from a deficiency in essential micronutrients as well as from anaemia.. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa \"remain the epicentre of the nutrition crisis among adolescent girls and women\", the report said.. It found that 68% of women and adolescent girls there were underweight, and 60% of those suffered from anaemia.. \"Inadequate nutrition during girls' and women's lives can lead to weakened immunity, poor cognitive development, and an increased risk of life-threatening complications - including during pregnancy and childbirth,\" Unicef said.. Malnutrition could also have \"dangerous and irreversible consequences for their children's survival, growth, learning, and future earning capacity\", it added.. \"Globally, 51 million children under two years are stunted. We estimate that about half of these children become stunted during pregnancy and the first six months of life, when a child is fully dependent on the mother for nutrition,\" it said.. Unicef estimates that between 2020 and 2022, the number of pregnant or breastfeeding women suffering from acute malnutrition increased from 5.5 to 6.9 million in the 12 countries deemed to be in food crisis.. These are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Chad and Yemen.. \"Without urgent action from the international community, the consequences could last for generations to come,\" said Unicef chief executive Catherine Russell.. \"To prevent undernutrition in children, we must also address malnutrition in adolescent girls and women,\" she added.. Unicef called for mandatory legal measures to \"expand large-scale food fortification of routinely consumed foods such as flour, cooking oil and salt\" to help reduce micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in girls and women..
