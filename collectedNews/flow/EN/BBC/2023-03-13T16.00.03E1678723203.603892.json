        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. More broadly across the whole Donetsk region, seven residents were injured altogether on Monday, Mr Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the enemy had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line, with an increase in the number of attacks. Mr Haidai added that Russian troops were also continuing to bring more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. There were also widespread reports of shelling across much of the Donbas region.. ",

        "content": "One of the girls filmed the chat over a teacher's shoulder, then shared it on social media, calling the teachers \"a disgrace\".. The teachers involved were suspended and the incident is being investigated.. There are about 150,000 citizens of Ethiopian origin in Israel, the first of whom arrived in sizeable numbers in a series of top secret Mossad-led operations in the 1980s. . The Ethiopian Jews' integration in Israel has been challenging, with the community suffering disproportionately high levels of unemployment and poverty as well as discrimination, although their situation has shown signs of improvement in recent years.. Last Monday, teachers and pupils from a religious high school in Netivot, southern Israel, set off on a three-day trip.. Girls sitting behind one of the teachers saw her messaging in the group chat, which contained disparaging comments towards the Ethiopian Israeli pupils.. One of the pupils took a video of the chat in action without the teacher realising. A pupil then shared a message to the perpetrators on social media, attaching pictures of the offensive messages.. \"Good morning to all the 'educators' of this school,\" she wrote. \"It saddens me as a member of the [Ethiopian] community to see the level you sank to today. Instead of being our teachers and setting an example and making us feel like we're in our safest place, you did the exact opposite. . \"Opening a group called 'Black School Trip' without even realising that there were students behind you and mocking your students? I see the photos, and I just don't believe that they come from our teachers. . \"You are a disgrace, I'm ashamed that you're our teachers and that you're teaching the future generation.\". The teachers involved were suspended and have apologised.. The school's headmaster issued a statement, speaking of his \"shock and devastation to miserable and extremely offensive comments from teachers about Ethiopian students who study in the school\".. \"The school management looks at these comments severely. There is no place for racist comments, and we won't allow them in our school.\". Israeli Education Minister Yoav Kisch also denounced the teachers.. \"The incident will be dealt with severely with all the tools at our disposal,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for the distress that was caused for the students. There will be zero tolerance for these sorts of incidents on my watch.\". This video can not be played. Former Ethiopian Israeli minister: 'We have a common struggle against racism'. ",

        "content": "It is trying to keep bank runs from spreading after SVB collapsed amid a rush of customer withdrawals.. Americans should \"rest assured that our banking system is safe\", Mr Biden said.. People and businesses who have money deposited with SVB would be able to access all their cash from Monday, he said.. Taxpayers will not bear any losses from the move, which will be funded by fees regulators charge to banks, he said. The banks' leaders will be fired, he added. . Mr Biden spoke early on Monday, as the failures of SVB - the country's 16th largest bank- and Signature raised concerns that it could spark a financial crisis. . \"Every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them,\" President Biden said.  \"Let me also assure you we will not stop at this. We'll do whatever is needed.\". SVB - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by regulators who seized its assets on Friday. It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. It came after SVB was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds leading to a cash crisis.. Authorities on Sunday also said they had taken over Signature Bank of New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run after SVB.. There is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another bank, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles brewing for other firms. . US financial markets were roughly flat as trading opened on Monday. . But shares of many banks were under pressure. Shares in First Republic bank, which is based in San Francisco, plunged roughly 70% on Monday, as investors sold off shares, worried it could be next.. As part of their moves to restore confidence, regulators also unveiled a new way to give banks access to emergency funds. . The Federal Reserve said it would offer assistance through a new Bank Term Funding Program, making it easier for banks to borrow from it in a crisis.. Elsewhere, HSBC said it was buying the UK arm of SVB for Â£1, while authorities in Canada took temporary control of the assets of SVB's branch in the country. The top banking regulator said it intended to seek permanent control.. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks, which can happen in the blink of an eye in the digital age. But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. I've been speaking to people with money stuck in SVB over the weekend. . One founder told me had been constantly refreshing his online banking page, hoping it might work. . Another said he was confident the government would step in, but admitted he might have lost about around 40% of the company's cash overnight. . This statement, then, has been welcomed by depositors. But there are those that will raise eyebrows at this move. . SVB mainly banked start-ups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley - the tech elite.  And those Silicon Valley elites tend to have more than a streak of libertarianism to their politics: the boilerplate view is that government is slow and too big. . Critics argue that it's with great irony that it's the government who has stepped in to save the day. Some will wonder whether influential tech bros have been given preferential treatment: capitalism for when things go well, socialism for when it doesn't. . It's why the statement is worded carefully that taxpayers will not be paying for this. Mr Biden will now have to defend the move - and reassure members of his own party that guaranteeing depositors was the only way. . SVB started as a California bank in 1983 and expanded rapidly over the last decade. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector, it was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm came under pressure last year, as its customers increasingly drew on deposits, because higher interest rates were making it more difficult to bring in new money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Etsy and Roku were among the big-name companies that had money tied up in the bank. . \"At Etsy, supporting our sellers is our highest priority, and we understand how important it is for these small businesses to be able to receive their funds when they need them,\" an Etsy spokesperson said on Sunday.. \"We recently experienced a delay in issuing payments to some sellers related to the unexpected collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Our teams have been working around the clock to implement a solution.. \"We expect to pay sellers via our other payment partners within the next several business days and that we will be able to begin processing these payments as soon as tomorrow, March 13.\".

        "content": "It adds that accounting firms in London and the British Virgin Islands acted for UK companies involved in the deals.. The story raises fresh doubts about the UK's efforts to tackle illegal wealth. . British authorities have long been accused of not doing enough to prevent criminals from overseas using UK property to launder money.. The report says the ease with which Karimova obtained UK property was \"concerning\".. There is no suggestion that those acting for the companies linked to her were aware of any connection to her nor that the source of funds could have been suspicious. No-one who provided those services in the UK has been investigated or fined. . For a time Gulnara Karimova was tipped to succeed her father, Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan as president of the central Asian state from 1989 until his death in 2016. She appeared in pop videos under the stage name \"Googoosha\", ran a jewellery company and served as ambassador to Spain. . But then in 2014 she disappeared from public view. It later emerged she had been detained on corruption charges while her father was still in power and she was sentenced in December 2017. In 2019 she was sent to prison for breaching the terms of her house arrest. . Prosecutors accused her of being part of a criminal group that controlled assets of more than $1bn (Â£760m) in 12 countries, including the UK, Russia and United Arab Emirates. \"The Karimova case is one of the largest bribery and corruption cases of all time,\" says Tom Mayne, one of the researchers on the Freedom For Eurasia report and a research fellow at the University of Oxford. . However, Karimova and her associates had already sold some of the property allegedly acquired with corrupt funds.. Freedom For Eurasia researched property and land registry records to identify at least 14 properties it says were purchased before she was arrested, with allegedly suspicious funds, in various countries, including the UK, Switzerland, France, Dubai and Hong Kong.. The report to be published on Tuesday 14 March, titled Who Enabled the Uzbek Princess?, focuses on five properties bought in and around London, now worth an estimated Â£50m - including three flats in Belgravia, just west of Buckingham Palace, a house in Mayfair and an Â£18m Surrey manor house with a private boating lake.. Two of the Belgravia flats were sold in 2013 before Karimova was detained. In 2017, the house in Mayfair, the Surrey mansion and a third flat in Belgravia were frozen by the Serious Fraud Office. . Freedom For Eurasia's report also names firms in London and the British Virgin Islands that it claims were used by Karimova or associates to enable them to spend the proceeds of crime on the properties as well as on private jetliner. . Karimova's boyfriend, Rustam Madumarov, and others now alleged to be associates of hers were listed in official documents as the \"beneficial owners\" - a legal term for the person who ultimately is in control - of companies based in the UK, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands. But the report says they were just proxies for Karimova, who used the firms to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.. Accountancy services for two UK companies linked to Karimova - Panally Ltd and Odenton Management Ltd - were provided by SH Landes LLP, a firm formerly located on New Oxford Street in London.. In late July 2010, SH Landes sought to register or acquire another company. The aim was to purchase a private jet for around $40m (Â£33m), with Madumarov named as the beneficial owner. In fact, according to the report, Karimova was really behind the purchase.. When asked at the time about the source of his funds, SH Landes replied: \"We believe that the question regarding his personal wealth is not relevant in this situation.\" This was seemingly because the money to buy the jet was not being provided by Madumarov out of his personal funds.. The London-based firm later said Madumarov's wealth came partly from a mobile phone company based in Uzbekistan, Uzdonrobita. Questions had already been raised about the company's possible links to Karimova. As far back as 2004, an article for the Moscow Times had alleged that Karimova siphoned some $20m out of Uzdunrobita using fraudulent invoices. A former adviser had also accused Karimova of \"racketeering\".. Because it was a high-value transaction linked to a high-risk jurisdiction, Uzbekistan, the report argues that SH Landes should have conducted \"enhanced due diligence\" - thorough background checks to ensure the source of funds was legitimate and not derived from criminal activity.. SH Landes also submitted the 2012 financial statements for Panally Ltd. The report says in September 2013 they were signed off by a close associate of Karimova's: Gayane Avakyan, then aged 30.. The previous year, the BBC had .  that Avakyan was the registered beneficial owner of Takilant, a Gibraltar-registered company at the centre of \"a high-level multi-million dollar fraud and corruption scandal in Uzbekistan\". . In a statement to the BBC, Steven Landes said: \"SH Landes LLP was never engaged by Gulnara Karimova. SH Landes LLP did act on behalf of Rustam Madumarov.. \"SH Landes LLP obtained due diligence on all its clients and relevant regulatory authorities were notified and kept appraised.\". Tom Mayne of Freedom For Eurasia said the apparent ease with which Karimova managed to buy so much UK property was concerning.. \"It took the authorities until 2017 to do anything, years after other countries had already frozen bank accounts and properties that belonged to her,\" he added. .

Quan, who starred alongside Ford in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was a child, won best supporting actor for Everything Everywhere All at Once following a two-decade break from performing.. After . , he excitedly ran up to the stage and embraced his former co-star, who presented the award.. Lady Gaga made sure her vocals were centre stage when she performed without make-up and wearing jeans and a plain T-shirt.. The look for her performance of Hold My Hand, nominated for best original song, was a stark contrast to her earlier appearance on the not-so-red carpet, in a black Versace dress with a sheer corset bodice.. While on the carpet, she received praise from fans on social media for rushing to the aid of a photographer who appeared to have fallen when walking past her.. British actor Hugh Grant's humour was a hit with the crowd at the Dolby Theatre.. When presenting the award for best production design with his Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star Andie MacDowell, Grant joked: \"The purpose of this is two-fold.. \"The first is to raise the vital importance of a good moisturiser. Andie has used one every day of her life, I have not.\" . Grant then gestured to MacDowell, saying: \"Still stunning.\" He then gestured to himself: \"Basically a scrotum.\". Earlier in the evening, Grant seemed less enthused as he spoke to model Ashely Graham about his cameo appearance in the film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.. Asked about his experience filming the sequel, he replied: \"Well I'm barely in it. I'm in it for three seconds.\". Probed further about whether he enjoyed filming it, he replied: \"Almost.\". When presenting the In Memoriam tribute for Hollywood figures who have died last year, John Travolta offered an emotional tribute to his Grease co-star Olivia Newton John. . \"We remain hopelessly devoted to you,\" Travolta tearfully said, referencing the iconic song by Newton John.. The late-night talk show host returned to host his third Academy Awards ceremony. He quickly addressed last year's Oscars controversy, when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage. . \"We want you to have fun, feel safe and, most importantly, we want me feel safe. So, we have strict policies in place,\" Kimmel said.. \"If anyone in this theatre commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute long speech.. \"But seriously, the Academy has a crisis team in place,\" he added. \"If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the show, sit there and do absolutely nothing. Maybe even give the assailant a hug.\". In an ode to the Irish film Banshees of Inisherin, Kimmel later brought a donkey on stage. . \"She's a certified emotional support donkey. At least that's what we told the airline to get her on the plane from Ireland. If you're feeling sad or need a hug... Let's get you back on that Spirit Airlines flight now.\". Elizabeth Banks presented the award for best visual effects - accompanied by a very hyperactive grizzly.. \"I recently directed the film Cocaine Bear and without visual effects, this is what the bear would look like,\" Banks joked. . The directors of best short film, An Irish Goodbye, used their acceptance speech to sing a rendition of Happy Birthday to one of the film's stars, James Martin.. After saying their thank yous, director Ross White said: \"This award is actually the second most important thing about today because it's this man's birthday\", referring to Martin.. \"We'd like to use the rest of our time up here to sing for James,\" he added, before leading the audience in song while Martin clasped the Oscars award..

        "content": "WATCH: The must-see moments from this year's Oscars. The dazzling multiverse adventure won seven awards including best picture, director and original screenplay.. Accepting her statuette, Yeoh said: \"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities.. \"And ladies, don't let anybody tell you that you are ever past your prime.\". Yeoh's co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis triumphed in the supporting actor and actress categories. In the history of the Oscars, no other film has ever won best picture, best director and three acting prizes.. In Everything Everywhere All at Once, Yeoh plays a Chinese-American laundrette owner who is mired in a tax audit, stuck in a crumbling marriage and struggling to connect with her daughter Joy.. But when she discovers different versions of herself in the multiverse, she must tap into their skills in order to save the world.. \"This is proof that dreams do come true,\" Yeoh said in her speech. \"I have to dedicate this to all the moms in the world because they are the superheroes, and without them, none of us would be here tonight.\". The 60-year-old enjoyed a late surge in momentum in this year's Oscars race, ultimately overtaking the early frontrunner Cate Blanchett.. Yeoh is only the second woman of colour to win best leading actress, following Halle Berry for Monster's Ball more than two decades ago.. Best leading actress has historically been far less diverse than the supporting actress category, where Ariana DeBose, Yuh-jung Youn, Regina King, Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong'o and Octavia Spencer have won in the past decade.. Elsewhere, Brendan Fraser capped his extraordinary comeback after years away from the Hollywood spotlight by winning best actor for his performance in The Whale.. Thanking the film's director, the 54-year-old said: \"I'm grateful to Darren Aronofsky for throwing me a creative lifeline.\". \"I just wanted to say thank you for this acknowledgement,\" he said.. Addressing his fellow nominees, he said: \"You laid your whale-sized hearts so we could see into your souls, like no-one else could do, and it is my honour to be named alongside you in this category.\". Fraser was a huge film star at the turn of the millennium, starring in films such as George of the Jungle and The Mummy.. But he spent years out of the spotlight as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, mostly taking on smaller roles. . That changed when he was cast in The Whale as an overweight professor trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter.. Fraser transformed his appearance for the film, which also won best make-up and hairstyling.. This video can not be played. WATCH: Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis make emotional speeches. Much like Fraser, best supporting actor winner Quan has enjoyed a comeback narrative this awards season. The actor catapulted back into the spotlight thanks to his role in Everything Everywhere All at Once.. He told the audience: \"Dreams are something you have to believe in - I almost gave up on mine.\". The 51-year-old took an extended break from acting after rising to fame as a child star in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.. In an emotional speech, the Vietnamese-American actor said: \"They say stories like this only happen in the movies - I cannot believe it is happening to me. This is the American dream.. \"My journey started on a boat, I spent a year in a refugee camp, and somehow I ended up here, on Hollywood's biggest stage... Thank you so much for welcoming me back.\". Curtis won the first Oscar of her 45-year acting career by scoring best supporting actress - one of the tightest categories of the night.. \"I know it looks like I'm standing up here by myself but I am not, I am hundreds of people,\" Curtis said in her acceptance speech. \"The entire group of artists who made this movie - we just won an Oscar.\". Everything Everywhere also won best editing, best original screenplay and best directing for Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert - jointly known as Daniels.. Accepting best picture, Kwan said \"I realised growing up that one of the things we can do for each other is shelter each other from the chaos of this crazy world that we live in. Thank you to the storytellers who did that for me.\". All Quiet on the Western Front, Netflix's German-language World War One epic, finished the night in second place with four awards - best international feature, original score, production design and cinematography.. Its success at the Oscars follows a string of technical wins at the Baftas, but the film failed to replicate its British victory in the top category.. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio was named best animated feature. The Mexican filmmaker said: \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre and animation is ready to be taken to the next step.\". Wakanda Forever's Ruth E Carter repeated the best costume design victory she scored with the original Black Panther. She dedicated the prize to her mother, who died aged 101 last week.. There was a British win for The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse. The adaptation of the illustrated Charlie Mackesy book, which aired on BBC One over Christmas, won best animated short. . The award for best documentary feature went to Navalny, about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the events related to his 2020 poisoning.. In his speech, director Daniel Roher dedicated the award to Navalny, who has been imprisoned for two years, saying: \"Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to the world.\". Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, added: \"Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free, stay strong my love.\". There was a win in the best sound category for Top Gun: Maverick - one of the biggest box office hits of the past year - . Elsewhere at the ceremony, a dressed-down Lady Gaga sang a stripped-back rendition of Hold My Hand (from Top Gun: Maverick) while Rihanna sang Lift Me Up (from Wakanda Forever).. The 95th Academy Awards ceremony was hosted by US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel, who opened with a monologue which reflected on the past 12 months in the film industry.. \"They say Hollywood is running out of ideas. I mean, poor Steven Spielberg had to make a movie about Steven Spielberg,\" he joked, referring to the director's autobiographical best picture nominee The Fabelmans..
