        "content": "City police who are on the frontline against militants believe they were targeted to demoralise them.. It comes two months after the Pakistani Taliban abandoned a ceasefire.. Since then violence has been on the rise, with frequent attacks on police and soldiers.. A claim that the hard-line Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as it is known, carried out Monday's bombing was later denied by the group, which blamed it on the commander of a breakaway faction. . Some observers are questioning the denial - they suggest it could be a distraction ploy.. In the past the TTP has refrained from claiming some attacks on mosques, schools or markets, preferring to cast its violence as a war with security forces and not against the Pakistani people.. This video can not be played. Pakistan mosque blast: Mass funeral held for police victims. The TTP has been fighting Pakistan's armed forces and police for years, with huge loss of life. An offshoot of the Afghan Taliban, the group shares the same hard-line ideology, but is separate from it. . At the top of a long list of its demands, the Pakistani Taliban wants to impose its interpretation of Sharia law in Pakistan's north-west. . At one point about a decade ago, the TTP threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas it controlled along the mountainous border with Afghanistan, which has been a hotbed of militant activity for decades.. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot. She had been campaigning for girls' education.. A major military offensive two years later following the Peshawar school massacre - an attack the TTP didn't claim and which killed 141 people, most of them children - greatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan. . Amid public fury, the army destroyed militant centres and pushed insurgents over the border into Afghanistan. Militant violence inside Pakistan fell.. But in recent years attacks by the TTP and others have been on the rise again in north-west Pakistan.. After the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, former Pakistani PM Imran Khan offered militants who had been hiding over the border a chance to return home and settle down - if they laid down their arms.  . The militants returned but didn't agree to hand over their weapons - and that is where the current problems started. This led to the dialogue begun by Imran Khan breaking down. . The new political and military leaders who came in after he was ousted last year didn't agree with the militants' demands and stopped talking to the Pakistani Taliban. As a result the TTP ended the ceasefire in November and resumed attacks. . Ashraf Ali, who runs a blood donation organisation, said people in Peshawar were living in fear. . \"I, along with my family and all the citizens, are in deep trauma. People are scared here,\" he told the BBC.. \"Everyone is worried about what is going to happen next because it was a long journey from terrorism to tourism in Peshawar and now again Peshawar has been badly affected with terrorism.\" . Pakistan says its forces are ready to take on the militants. But the police remain ill-equipped to fight the highly trained and well-armed insurgents. Recent militant attacks include overrunning police stations - in some cases police did not offer resistance. . The public want the violence ended once and for all, and experts are now calling for an all-out military operation to beat the militants, as happened in 2014. . But Pakistanis are dejected and critical of the state's attempts to deal with militancy, which has gone on for two decades in a cycle that seems to keep repeating itself. . Many think there are still elements within the Pakistan security and civil establishment who are soft on the militants and that's the reason the threat isn't tackled properly.. ",

        "content": "Cospito has been refusing food for more than 100 days.. The new restrictions, usually reserved for mafia bosses, include one monitored visit from family members and one telephone call a month.. The measures, known as 41bis after an article of the Italian criminal code, were introduced in their current form in 1992, after the mafia killings of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and were originally meant to cut off Mafia bosses from the outside world and other inmates, and to prevent them from ordering criminal acts from behind bars. . Now, however, the 41bis prison regime can be imparted on people who have been found guilty of crimes ranging from terrorism to tobacco smuggling and kidnapping.. Critics of the 41bis - including former prisoners who experienced it - say that the solitude faced by those who live through it is \"unbearable\" and that cells are barely big enough for a bed. . Aside from only receiving one monitored visit from family members a month, prisoners are also banned from interacting with other prisoners or meeting with third parties, have to spend their one recess hour a day in isolation, have no access to the prison's communal areas and are kept under 24/7 surveillance.. Some legal experts have said that the 41bis is \"a medieval form of punishment\".. The lawyers for far-left terrorist Nadia Lioce, who has been living under the 41bis regime for two decades, have said that because of the severe limitations on the number of hours she can see her family or legal team she has effectively only interacted with people for a total of 15 hours in the space of a year. . Italian media reported Lioce's lawyers as saying she is now so \"psychologically isolated\" that, when her mother and sister visit, she is unable to speak to them for more than a few minutes.. Amnesty International and the European Court of Human Rights have both criticised several aspects of the 41bis, and in 2007 a US court refused to extradite a convicted Mafia drug trafficker on the grounds that the 41bis regime he would face in Italy would have \"constituted torture\".. Cospito is serving two jail sentences - 10 years for a gun attack on the CEO of a nuclear engineering company in Genoa in 2012 and 20 years in prison for bomb attacks against a Carabinieri police school in Fossano, masterminded whilst in prison. His partner is also serving time. . He was moved on Monday from a prison in Sardinia to Milan's Opera prison - a facility for inmates who need critical medical care. He has lost more than 40kg (6.2 stone) during the course of his hunger strike but the government has refused to lift the terms of his imprisonment.. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said her government will not be intimidated by the threats of violence.. Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said on Tuesday that the wave of violence and vandalism in recent days proved a link continued to exist between Cospito and other anarchists and \"that would tend to justify maintaining the 41bis\".. Protests against his incarceration have included attacks against Italian diplomats in Germany, Spain and Greece as well as in South America. Threatening letters containing bullets have been sent to officials. . In the most serious attack, the car of senior diplomat Susanna Schlein was destroyed by a petrol bomb in Athens in early December.. Several cars were set alight in Rome and Milan in further incidents on Monday night.. Cospito's case is due to be heard by Italy's highest court in March.. ",

Kelly, 56, was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. . Last year, he was also convicted on sex crimes charges for which he is scheduled  to be sentenced next month and likely won't be allowed for release until he is 80.. Cook County State's Attorney Foxx announced the state's case in 2019, saying the incidents occurred from May 1998 to January 2010. Illinois has no statute of limitations on child sex abuse charges.. But federal prosecutors in Chicago and New York moved more briskly to file indictments and along with Covid-19 delays, the Cook County courts were slowed. . \"Due to the extensive sentences that these convictions hold, our office has decided not to continue to expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments that we previously charged Mr. Kelly,\" Ms Foxx said. . She said resources will be put to better use to prosecute other sexual offenders. . In 2019, Ms Foxx had urged victims to come forward in order to bring charges against Kelly.  . Lanita Carter, who came forward in 2019, objected to this decision to drop charges. . \"I have spent nearly twenty years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,\" she said, \"With today's announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone.\". Kelly also faces a sexual misconduct case in Hennepin County Minnesota, but that case has been paused during the ongoing federal cases as well. . ",

The video showed them dancing by Tehran's Azadi (Freedom) Tower.. Authorities are handing heavy sentences to people seen to be involved in protests after the death of a woman who was detained by morality police.. The couple did not link their dance to the ongoing protests in Iran.. A source has confirmed to BBC Monitoring that the couple's arrest came after they posted the video to their Instagram accounts, which have a combined following of nearly two million. . Anti-government protests - labelled \"riots\" by Iran's regime - swept across the country after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custody in September last year. She was arrested in Tehran for allegedly violating the rule requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf.. Astiazh Haqiqi, 21, and her fiance Amir Mohammad Ahmadi, 22, are said to be convicted of \"promoting corruption and prostitution, colluding against national security, and propaganda against the establishment\".. The family home of Ms Haqiqi, who lists her profession as a fashion designer, was raided before the arrest.. It is unclear how long the sentence is for each of the separate convictions they are facing. They have each been sentenced to a total of 10 and a half years - a combined sentence for the charges. . If their verdicts are upheld, they will have to serve the longest one of those sentencing terms..

        "content": "They still have no body to bury. No grave to visit. The last they heard from him was a phone call from prison, and he signed off with these words to his mother: \"Alright, I have to go. I'm glad you're OK.\"  . Neither had any inkling that it would be the last time they spoke.  . A month later, Mustafa was dead - one of 81 men killed on 12 March 2022, in the largest mass execution in modern Saudi history. . Mustafa's name is on a long and growing list put together by the campaign group Reprieve - which, along with the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, has been meticulously documenting Saudi executions for a new report.. Based on data collected since 2010, .  has found that:. Reprieve documented 147 executions in Saudi Arabia last year, but says there could well have been more. It also says the country has \"disproportionately\" used the death penalty against foreign nationals - including female domestic workers and low-level drug offenders. . Nearly a year on, officials haven't told Mustafa's family how he and the others were executed. His older brother, Yasser, says it has been a tragedy for the families. . \"We don't know whether they were given a decent burial or thrown in the desert or in the sea. We've no idea.\". Yasser is speaking publicly for the first time. He now lives in Germany, where he has been given political asylum after fleeing Saudi Arabia in 2016, fearing the same fate suffered by his brother.. Yasser says his brother was \"fun, sociable, and popular\". Since 2011, Mustafa took part in .  - led by the country's Shia minority - against the Saudi government. . He was detained in 2014. After his death, an official announcement said that he, along with 30 others, had been executed for the same string of offences - including attempted murder of security personnel, rape, robbery, bomb-making, stirring up strife and spreading chaos as well as trading in weapons and drugs.. \"They never provided any evidence. This lie cuts very deep,\" explains Yasser - who says his brother was still trying to appeal his conviction when the authorities executed him and the 80 other men.. \"Not only did they take their lives, they intentionally maligned them and accused them of things they've not done.\" . After rising to power, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi's de-facto ruler, promised to modernise the Kingdom - and suggested .  that his country, a key Western ally, was trying to \"minimise\" its use of the death penalty.. But, nearly five years on, Saudi Arabia remains one of the world's most prolific executioners - despite a lull that coincided with Saudi Arabia's presidency of the G20 and the start of the Covid pandemic. . The crown prince - known as MBS - has \"done the exact opposite of what he promised\" Reprieve's director, Maya Foa, tells me from her east London office. \"He has overseen vast numbers of executions and a brutal crackdown on people attending pro-democracy protests.\". What's more, she adds, there is a regime of secrecy around the death penalty, explaining that for many of the cases Reprieve have looked at, nobody knew they were even on death row.  . \"Their family members did not know. So you had people who were arrested, tried, sentenced to death and then executed in secret.\". Some families only discovered via social media that their loved ones had been killed, says Ms Foa - describing that lack of official information as one of the \"most cruel and distressing\" aspects of each case.. Traditionally, beheading has been the main method of execution in Saudi Arabia - the executions used to take place in public - with the names of those killed, and the charges they faced, published on government websites. . But human rights activists say the use of the death penalty has become much more opaque.. Nobody I spoke to knew exactly how executions are now carried out, though firing squads are also thought to be used. . The death penalty is part of a Saudi legal system which \"is unfair in its essence\", says Ali Adubisi, director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights. \"No type of independent civil society or human rights groups can operate there. If we weren't drawing attention to the executions, people would be killed in silence.\". Human Rights Watch said that 41 of the 81 men executed in March were from the Shia minority and that \".  in Saudi Arabia's criminal justice system suggest it is highly unlikely that any of the men received a fair trial\". They also heard reports of torture.. When Yasser was first allowed to visit Mustafa, 12 months after his arrest in 2014, he was shocked by what he saw.. \"Even though it had been a year since we had last seen him, he couldn't even stand up to greet us.. \"He'd fall over as soon as he tried - and when we asked him, he said it was because of torture. . \"We saw bruises on his body and he told us he'd been given electric shocks.\"   . The sister of another detainee told me her brother had also been badly tortured. . \"He said he was strung up by his feet and beaten. He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" says Zainab Abu Al-Khair, whose brother Hussein has been in prison since 2014. . Hussein - a Jordanian driver working for a wealthy Saudi family - was arrested with drugs in his car on the Jordan-Saudi border. Zainab is certain they were not his.  . Speaking from her home in Canada, she explains how Hussein's family have been struggling to make ends meet since his arrest. He has a disabled son and, after he was imprisoned, his 14-year-old daughter was \"sold into marriage\" in Jordan.. Last November, Saudi Arabia ended an unofficial moratorium on the death penalty for drug offences - a move described by the UN Human Rights Office as \"deeply regrettable\". Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed for such offences, . . . In prison, says Zainab, men have since been taken from Hussein's cell never to return. . It has left both Hussein and Zainab terrified. \"I can't even talk about him without my heart pounding,\" she told me. . \"I think of him all day and at night, I have bad dreams. The thought they might chop off his head - it's barbarity.. \"You can't imagine how hard it is. Sometimes I just sit alone and cry, cry, cry.\". Part of the anger she is feeling is directed at other countries for allowing Saudi Arabia \"to get away with it\". . Last March - four days after the mass execution of 81 men - the then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson met Mohammed bin Salman to try to persuade him to pump more oil to replace Russian fuel imports. Downing Street said Mr Johnson did raise concerns about Saudi Arabia's ongoing human rights issues.. Since coming to power, MBS has carried out social and economic reforms - including allowing women to drive - but they've been accompanied by intensified political repression.. The .  describes Saudi Arabia's human rights record as \"deplorable\" - a stain on its reputation, which it is busy trying to \"launder\" through sports and entertainment.. The BBC has sent three emails to the Saudi Human Rights Commission - a Saudi government organisation - asking to speak to an official, but has received no replies. . A statement to the BBC from the Saudi embassy in London noted that many other nations around the world have the death penalty, and that countries have different views about what penalties are appropriate. It said: \"As we respect their right to determine their own laws and customs, we hope that others will respect our sovereign right to follow our own judicial and legislative choices.\". But the comments failed to address the steep rise in executions under the crown prince, MBS, or the way the death penalty is being used, in contravention of international norms.. The UN Human Rights Office told the BBC it was \"deeply concerned about the trend in the use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia\".. \"In particular, we are concerned by the increase in the number of death sentences issued and upheld, including against child offenders, and for offences that do not meet the 'most serious crimes' threshold of international law, such as drug-related offences,\" it said.. For those whose loved ones are in prison, it's a desperately anxious time. Hussein's sister keeps a vigilant eye on the family chat group. . \"It's not a life to deal with this stress,\" she says. \"Every morning, every evening, we have to check he's still alive.\". ",
