        "content": "Watch: US official confirms downing of object over Alaska. Spokesman John Kirby said the unmanned object was \"the size of a small car\" and was over a sparsely populated area at the time.. President Joe Biden took the decision to shoot down the object, which was of unknown origin, Mr Kirby said.. It comes after the US shot down a Chinese balloon over its territorial waters last Saturday.. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Kirby explained that the object over Alaska was travelling at 40,000ft (12,000m) and posed a \"reasonable threat\" to civilian aircraft.. He said the object had fallen into US waters that are currently frozen, adding that its debris field was \"much, much smaller\" than the balloon shot down last week off the coast of South Carolina.. \"We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,\" Mr Kirby said.. He said a fighter jet had approached the object and assessed there was nobody onboard, and this information was available to Mr Biden when he made his decision.. Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that an F-22 jet shot down the object - which was moving at an unknown speed - with a sidewinder missile at 13:45 EST (18:45 GMT).. Mr Ryder said a significant amount of debris had been recovered so far. . It was being loaded onto vessels and taken to \"labs for subsequent analysis,\" he said, which \"will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities\".. Officials have not yet determined whether the object was involved in surveillance, and Mr Kirby corrected a reporter who referred to it as a balloon.. He did not specify the exact location where the object was shot down, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it had closed airspace in the area of Deadhorse, in northern Alaska.. No other objects of a threatening nature have been identified above the US at this time, according to the White House.. Mr Kirby said the object did not appear to have the manoeuvrable capability like the Chinese balloon and seemed to be \"virtually at the whim of the wind\".. The object was first spotted on Thursday night, though officials did not specify a time. During a second examination of the object, the F-22 jet, based out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, shot it down.. ",

Nasyrova will be sentenced next month, and is facing up to 25 years in prison.. At the time, the pair looked quite similar, with dark hair and the same skin complexion, and they were both Russian speakers.. \"The jury saw through the deception and schemes of the defendant,\" Melinda Katz, the Queens District Attorney . .. \"Fortunately, her victim survived and the poison led right back to the culprit,\" Ms Katz added.. The jury heard that in August 2016, Nasyrova, now 47, went to her beautician's house in Queens with a box of cheesecake - eating two pieces herself, and offering the third, poisoned slice to Ms Tsvyk, who was 35 at the time. She started to vomit and went to lie down.. This video can not be played. Watch: Prosecutor describes the pain inflicted by the poisoning. \"Before passing out, the woman's last memory was of seeing the defendant walking around her room,\" Ms Katz's statement said.. Ms Tsvyk's friend found her unconscious the next day, her clothes changed to lacey lingerie and pills scattered around the floor as if she had tried to take her own life.. When she finally returned home, Ms Tsvyk's Ukrainian passport and US work permit were missing, as well as jewellery and about $4,000 (Â£3,300) in cash, the prosecutor said during opening statements.. Phenazepam, a strong sedative, was detected in remnants of the cheesecake, and the pills scattered on the floor were also confirmed to be the same drug.. Nasyrova, who lives in Brooklyn, was convicted on Thursday of attempted murder, assault and unlawful imprisonment.. This is not the first time she has been in trouble with the law.. In 2015, Interpol issued a red notice for her arrest over the murder of a woman in Russia a year earlier. She is accused of killing her neighbour Alla Alekseenko and stealing her life savings.. Nasyrova, who US media reports is a former dominatrix, has also been accused of drugging and robbing men she met on dating websites.. Her crimes - both alleged and convicted - were the subject of a documentary by .  in 2017.. ",

        "content": "With the war raging in neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova has been facing inflation, high energy prices, a refugee influx and Russian aggression.. The news came just hours after Russian missiles flew over Moldovan airspace.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, Ms Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\".. Moldova is precariously close to the war - it shares a 1,222km (759 mile) border with Ukraine, and has suffered greatly from the fallout of Russia's invasion.. \"I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,\" Ms Gavrilita said at a news conference. . \"We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in,\" she said, referring to the Kremlin. . An energy crisis was sparked last year when Russia suddenly reduced its gas supplies to Moldova, which relied 100% on Russia for gas. It caused inflation to skyrocket and there was public unrest over the high energy costs.. President Maia Sandu thanked Ms Gavrilita for her \"enormous sacrifice and efforts to lead the country in a time of so many crises\".. \"We have stability, peace and development, where others wanted war and bankruptcy,\" the president said.. She has already nominated her former defence adviser Dorin Recean - who is also pro-EU - as the next prime minister. The Moldovan parliament will vote to confirm his nomination next week.. In the earlier days of the war in Ukraine, there were fears the conflict would spill over into Moldova, or that Russia might invade it too.. That concern has receded for now, but as . , pressure has increased from Russia - which has tried to undermine the former Soviet state, and the EU's influence.. In a stark warning on Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had a plan to \"destroy\" Moldova, according to Ukrainian intelligence.. \"These documents show who, when and how Russia is going to break democracy of Moldova and establish control,\" he told EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.. \"I immediately warned Moldova about these threats,\" he added.. Moldovan intelligence services later confirmed they had also identified \"subversive activities\" aimed at \"undermining the state of the Republic of Moldova, destabilizing and violating public order.\". There are also renewed tensions in Transnistria, a breakaway territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists that runs along Moldova's border with Ukraine, and where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed.. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of trying to turn Moldova against Russia - as he claimed it had already done with Ukraine.. Natalia Gavrilita became prime minister in August 2021 when President Sandu's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won a landslide parliamentary election.. She previously served as finance minister from June 2019 to November 2019 in when Ms Sandu was prime minister.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news. She was wearing an electronic bracelet, and was meant to be under house arrest.. \"My lawyer said 'flee, flee - they're going to put you in prison',\" she said at a press conference in Paris on Friday.. She left Moscow at the start of one weekend last year, when she judged that police would be less active, and changed vehicle seven times before approaching the border on foot.  . \"Our [last] vehicle got stuck in the mud,\" she told me, \"and we had no mobile phone coverage - we tried to find our way by the stars. It was a very dangerous and stressful escape.\". They wandered for hours near the border, she said, hiding from border patrols, before successfully making it across.. Part of that success is down to the organisation Reporters Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Reporters Without Borders). Its director, Christophe Deloire, explained how they helped her escape.. \"I wrote my first text message to Marina the day after she went on TV with that sign,\" he told me. \"I sent her a message saying: Do you need help? We are here for you.\"  . Last September, Ms Ovsyannikova sent a message to the organisation through an intermediary, asking for their help to leave.. \"We said, OK,\" explained Mr Deloire. \"[But] she's in Moscow under house arrest, her neighbours and family are Putinists - they could call the police and say she left - and she had an electronic bracelet. So there were many reasons [why] it was an incredibly difficult thing to escape. But she made it.\". Now settled in Paris, Ms Ovsyannikova, 44, says she is still \"of course, afraid for her life\", but believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is risking his leadership over the war in Ukraine.. \"The elite understands everything perfectly,\" she explained.. \"The people are living in this bubble of propaganda, but the ruling elite - those who have lost their planes, their yachts, their finances - they understand everything. As soon as a Ukrainian victory gets closer, I believe, the ruling establishment will present Putin with a big bill.\". Ms Ovsyannikova grabbed headlines around the world last March, when she burst into a live news broadcast at the state-run Channel One TV station where she worked at the time, with a sign reading \"no war, stop the war; don't believe the propaganda; they're lying to you here\".. She said she was \"immediately isolated by the FSB [Russia's security service]\", and her bosses interrogated.. As she collected her belongings from the office, she told me that \"I saw in my co-workers' eyes a totally compassionate expression. . \"They were looking at me with wild eyes, they were saying goodbye. They thought they would never see me again.\". Ms Ovsyannikova left Russia for Germany soon afterwards, but returned later that year - to fight for custody of her children, she says.. Further protests, including a demonstration near the Kremlin in July, saw her facing charges under a new Russian law, banning \"deliberately false information\" about Russia's armed forces.  . The law made it illegal to call the war an \"invasion,\" with Russian state-controlled news organisations instead told to describe it as a \"special military operation\".. Despite being targeted by the Russian regime, many Ukrainian journalists and Russian dissidents have expressed mistrust of Ms Ovsyannikova, pointing to her earlier career as a mouthpiece for the Russian state.. Her visit to Ukraine last summer to cover the war for Germany's Die Welt newspaper outraged many Ukrainians, who demanded her immediate sacking.. ",

We saw residents waiting around in the cold squares surrounded by debris, many wrapped in blankets and coats. . In the eastern neighbourhood of al-Shaar, the sound of diggers rang out against the backdrop of multi-storey buildings flattened to the ground. . \"We know someone in that building who lived on the first floor... he didn't have enough time to get out of his house,\" one woman told us, gesturing towards a pile of rubble.. \"The building collapsed while he was still in there. He died alongside his wife and children,\" she said.. Only one of his daughters was saved from under the rubble and is in the hospital now.. The quake has brought more misery to a country already gripped by crisis. . The death toll across government and rebel-held areas has reached nearly 4,000, with more than 7,000 people reported injured or unaccounted for. . Much of Aleppo was destroyed in the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned violent.. Despite efforts to rebuild some parts of the former cosmopolitan hub, the city still bears the wounds of the war between the Russian-backed Syrian government and rebel groups.. Now, rescue teams have to pull down even some of the buildings still standing, out of fear they might collapse later on. . \"Two buildings near me came down; they each contained around 30 flats, and at least five people were living in each flat,\" on man told us.. \"There are around 60 or 70 people still trapped under the rubble; only four or five people got out,\" he said.. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the instability of the buildings left standing. . \"As you can see the buildings are shaking while we work to save people. We can't have that under international health and safety guidelines. So we've evacuated the residents\" an army officer told us.  . \"There are a large numbers of people in shelters. Most of them are people who were evacuated because their buildings are not safe,\" he continued. . Thousands of residents from the worst-hit eastern districts of Aleppo have been forced into shelters. . After years of war and now a hugely destructive earthquake, what comes next for them is unknown. . ",
