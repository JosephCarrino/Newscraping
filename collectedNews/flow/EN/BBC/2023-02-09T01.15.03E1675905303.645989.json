The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu disagreed.. \"If there is one person responsible for this, it is Erdogan,\" he said..

In nearby Syria, relief efforts have been complicated by years of conflict that has destroyed the nation's infrastructure.. The Bab al-Hawa crossing between Turkey and Syria has been closed since the earthquake as the roads were badly damaged.. While a senior UN official said the road may soon be accessible, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the country was working to open two more border gates to help get aid into the country.. \"There are some difficulties in terms of Turkey's and the international community's aid [reaching Syria]. For this reason, efforts are being made to open two more border gates,\" he said.. The EU has confirmed it will send €3.5m (£3.1m) in aid to Syria following a government request for assistance, but said the aid must be delivered to both government- and rebel-controlled areas.. More than 1,500 people have died in Idlib province alone and an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said sanctions were stopping Syria from receiving the aid it needed.. \"We don't have enough bulldozers, we do not have enough cranes, we do not have enough oil due to European and American sanctions,\" Bouthaina Shabban said. .

He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull.. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol.. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an \"anti-Russian state\", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died. . Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon). . He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist. . The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline.. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired into the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances.. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed.. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them.. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, \"when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless\"..

Onlookers including family, friends and neighbours of the building's residents stopped talking, while cranes and other machinery nearby were switched off.. After minutes of silence, rescuers called out for an ambulance, confirming that a woman had been found alive. . The crowd broke into cheers and tears. . One woman, whose cousin and aunt lived in the building and are still missing, fell back onto a car bonnet and buried her face in her hands.. Onlookers told the BBC it marked the first time a survivor had been found at the six-storey apartment block since Monday's earthquake reduced it to rubble.. Shortly before they were found, a body had been pulled from the debris just a few metres away.. Rescue workers and volunteers quickly formed a chain to carry the woman to a waiting ambulance.. Local residents said she was a single mother in her 50s who lived alone in the building. Her son stood by the ambulance and watched as she was carried down, they added. . Several onlookers said it gave them renewed hope that their own missing loved ones would be found. One said she was hoping for a \"miracle\".. Rescue workers hugged as the woman was taken away - a rare moment of hope and happiness among so much devastation.. The mood at the Iskenderun apartment block quickly became sombre again as rescuers resumed the slow work of searching the rubble, largely by hand.. Local doctor Mehmet Riyat told the BBC medical staff had been overwhelmed since Monday.. \"We've had patients who have been crushed. We've seen lots of broken bones, broken necks, head injuries. And lots of deaths,\" he said.. \"As doctors we have to do our jobs. But when the support teams take over, then we think about our own families.\". There is destruction everywhere you turn in Iskenderun - many buildings have been destroyed, including a busy hospital.. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit back on Wednesday at . . Critics have said emergency efforts have been too slow and that not enough was done to prepare the earthquake-prone region by his government..
