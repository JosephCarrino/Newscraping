        "content": "But there are concerns the capital could follow Shanghai by enforcing a lockdown to contain the spread.. London's leading FTSE 100 share index tumbled, led by commodities firms such as oil producers and miners. . The FTSE clawed back from some losses from morning trade but the index was down 1.7% during the afternoon. Germany and France recorded similar declines.. In the US, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 opened lower. . Overnight China's Shanghai Composite Index fell by more than 5% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 3.7% lower.. \"The scourge of Covid continues, with China unwavering in its zero tolerance policy,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.. \"As cases erupt in Beijing, there is concern that prolonged lockdowns will hit employment and lead to a sharp slowdown in growth as well as sparking fresh shipping logjams and supply chain issues.\". Oil prices also fell on Monday, with Brent crude down 4.7% at $101.41 a barrel on the prospect of falling demand from China, the world's second largest economy after the US. . Oil giants such as BP and Shell saw their share prices fall on Monday. Shares in mining giants such as Anglo American, Glencore and Rio Tinto were also among the biggest losers in early trading.. Shanghai has been in lockdown for several weeks - but the daily death rate from Covid is rising and there are now thousands of known cases. In Beijing, there has been panic buying, as residents there fear they will soon face hefty restrictions of their own.. With China's \"zero Covid\" policy under pressure as never before, there are growing concerns about the impact all of this will have on the country's economy. Small wonder, then, that shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been tumbling.. The ripple-effects are being felt more widely too. Shares in mining companies such as Glencore and Anglo-American have been suffering steep falls; if China's economy loses steam, demand for raw materials will decline - and that will hit their profits.. Then you have the wider background - of continued Covid-related disruption to supply chains; of shortages and rising prices linked to the war in Ukraine; and of speculation the US Federal Reserve and other central banks will hike interest rates faster than expected in an effort to keep a lid on inflation.. All of this is creating a deeply queasy environment for investors - and weighing heavily on share prices around the world.. Beijing - which has a population of more than 21 million people - has reported a handful of new cases, but China has a strict zero-Covid policy in place. Over the weekend, some Beijing residents were told they needed to do Covid tests three times a week.. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, told that China Daily that the number of cases in Beijing is expected to increase in the following days.. In Shanghai, where there was a fresh outbreak a few weeks ago, much of the city is in lockdown or facing restrictions. . The latest outbreak in Shanghai, first detected in late March, has seen more than 400,000 cases recorded so far and 138 deaths.. Some factories in Shanghai have restarted production with companies such as electric car maker Tesla reportedly requiring employees to work on a \"closed-loop\" system which means they eat and sleep at the plant.  . \"The prospect of further restrictions in China could lead to a poisonous mix of further inflationary pressure, as supply chains in the so-called 'factory of the world' get disrupted and weaker economic growth,\" warned Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.. Analysts said stock markets in Europe and Asia were also affected by sharp falls on leading US indexes at the end of last week amid expectations of steep US interest rates rises to calm soaring inflation - currently at a 40-year high of 8.5%.. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes all fell by 2.5% or more. . Last week, Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted that the central bank may increase the key interest rate by half a percentage point at the next meeting in May. . This would follow a quarter percentage point rise in March.. Mr Powell said: \"It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly,\" adding that \"50 basis points will be on the table\". . Gary Lineker on football, politics and road rage.

        "content": "The two migrants survived and were taken into custody. . Over one million migrant \"encounters\" - apprehensions and expulsions - have been recorded on the border in the past six months, a 20-year high. . The Texas Military Department said that authorities were continuing to search for Mr Evans, who has been a member of the National Guard since May 2019 and previously served in Kuwait and Iraq.. On Saturday, dive teams searching for Mr Evans were forced to halt their operations due to strong currents. Rescue operations resumed on Sunday morning. . Mr Evans was assigned to Operation Lone Star, a border security operation announced by the state's Republican governor Greg Abbott last year. . The multi-billion dollar operation has seen thousands of state troopers and members of the Texas National Guard deployed to secure the state's 1,200 mile (1,920km) border with Mexico. . Mr Abbott said Mr Evans \"is a hero who risked his life in service to Texas & America\".. According to local media reports, Mr Evans took off his jacket and radio before jumping into the river to save the two migrants who were in distress. . The Texas Military Department said over the weekend that the two migrants \"were involved in illicit transnational narcotics trafficking\" and were taken into the custody of US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). . In December, the International Organization of Migration estimated that at least 650 migrants died while attempting to cross the border in 2021, the highest recorded since the agency began keeping track of deaths in 2014. . While Border Patrol officials have previously said many of the deaths are heat-related, a significant number of people also die while attempting to cross the Rio Grande. . A sheriff in Maverick County - where Eagle Pass is located - said about two drownings per week are recorded in that county alone. . Statistics released by CBP last week showed that agents made more than 209,000 arrests along the border in March, bringing the six month total to over one million.. Officials have warned of a massive influx of as many as 18,000 migrants per day after the end of Title 42, a pandemic policy that allowed migrants to be swiftly expelled from the US. .

        "content": "He also announced the US would allocate an extra $713m (Â£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations.. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of attempting to \"split Russian society and destroy Russia from within\". . Mr Austin, a retired four-star general, was speaking after meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. . The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. . At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".. The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with \"the right equipment\" and the \"right support\". . BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. . Mr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to \"destroy Russia\", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments.. US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (Â£260m) would be allocated to Ukraine. . It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). . Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles.. Last week the US confirmed it had supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. . Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. . Mr Blinken announced some US diplomatic staff would start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv initially, with a longer-term plan to re-open the US Embassy in the capital, Kyiv. . President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. . Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration had assembled had put pressure on President Putin's government.. \"The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,\" Mr Blinken said. \"And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding.\". \"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,\" Mr Blinken added. . Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated \"the unprecedented assistance\" from Washington and added that he \"would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine\". . President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. . But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US defence secretary. . America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. . More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. . Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. . To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China.  . For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. . In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. . On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow had made minor advances in the region but had \"yet to achieve a breakthrough\" because of logistical issues. . The update said: \"Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.\" . How many miles do you need to drive before it pays off?.

The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a \"president for all\".. He is the first sitting president in 20 years to be re-elected.. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen, 53, said her significant vote share still marked a victory.. The ideas her National Rally represented had reached new heights, she told her supporters. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had ultimately failed, just like her father who preceded her: \"It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat.\" . Marine Le Pen took over the party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 in a bid to make it electable. She won more than 13 million votes on Sunday, on a platform of tax cuts to tackle the high cost of living, a ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in public and a referendum on immigration controls.. \"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,\" Mr Macron said in his victory speech. \"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me.\". More than one in three voters did not vote for either candidate. . , the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969, and more than three million people cast spoilt or blank votes.. Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. Voters who said they were casting blank ballots told the BBC they wanted to punish the sitting president.. Anti-Macron demonstrators rallied in a number of cities, including Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, refusing to accept the result. . In his speech Mr Macron, 44, said his government would have to \"answer their choice to refuse to choose\". . Far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. . While it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, he claimed that Mr Macron had been elected with a worse result than any other president. \"He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots.\". Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who had feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. . German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was first to congratulate him, singling out their mutual challenge in responding to Russia's war on Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also said he looked forward to \"close co-operation\" including on supporting Ukraine.. This video can not be played. While Mr Macron has played a key diplomatic role in the war, Marine Le Pen has struggled to shake off accusations of ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated him as a \"true friend\" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe. . UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.. Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars. . Accompanied by his wife Brigitte and leading a group of children, he walked to the stage accompanied by the EU anthem Ode to Joy before promising supporters that \"no-one will be left by the wayside\". Addressing voters who had backed him to keep the far right out of power he said he would be indebted to them for years to come.. The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich.. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message, when France was going through a considerable crisis involving \"many divisions and a lack of understanding\". . Mr Castex is now likely to be replaced in the next few days, and Mr Macron may ask Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne to take over. She refused to say whether she had been lined up to be the next prime minister, insisting that the focus had to be on dealing with people's worries about living standards. But a ministerial colleague, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said the president was definitely keen on having a female prime minister.. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight and one opinion poll suggests 63% of voters want him to lose his majority.. If that happened, he would be forced into a \"cohabitation\" with a government led by other parties.. Mr MÃ©lenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. . In her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the \"match is not completely over\" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high.. For now there is no talk of a change of leadership in her National Rally party. \"Everything will be rebuilt around her, she's at the head of this popular and social bloc,\" spokeswoman Laure Lavalette told French TV..
