This video can not be played. Nichols' mother: Officers could not look me in the face. Members of Mr Nichols' family were in court with their lawyer, Ben Crump..

She promised to attend every court date until \"we get justice for my son\".. \"Memphis and the whole world needs to see that what's right is done in this case, and it needs to happen sooner rather than later,\" lead prosecutor Paul Hagerman told reporters..

He was pepper-sprayed, kicked and punched by the officers and died in hospital three days later.. Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said the incident was \"not just a professional failing\", but \"a failing of basic humanity toward another individual\".. RowVaughn Wells previously told BBC News it was the race of the victim - in this case her son - and not the race of the perpetrators that mattered.. \"It's not about the colour of the police officer. We don't care if it's black, white, pink, purple. What they did was wrong,\" she said.. The fallout from the violent arrest has had ripple effects throughout the city.. In addition to the arrest of the five officers directly involved, . .. A special unit that was designed to fight crime in Memphis . ..

The event is an annual gathering of leaders, officials and diplomats; its focus this year is transatlantic. . US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are attending with a large congressional delegation, alongside almost 30 European heads of government. . At the conference, Mr Scholz said it was \"wise to prepare for a long war\" and show Russian President Vladimir Putin that Germany and its allies would not give up on Ukraine. . Ukrainian officials have said they are urgently in need of heavier weapons, and that sufficient battle tanks could help Kyiv's forces seize back territory from the Russians.. Germany - who in recent months came under growing pressure over its apparent hesitation to send weapons to Ukraine - . .. It also allowed other countries to send their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine - which was restricted until now under export regulations.. Mr Macron said the next few weeks would be decisive, adding allies needed to \"intensify our support\" for Ukraine to be able to launch a counter-offensive, so later the country could enter negotiations in a position of strength.. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to assembled leaders via video link, urged allies to speed up the supply of weapons, warning there was no alternative to victory over Moscow.. No Russian officials have been invited. . The agenda is broad - from China to climate change - but the conference will give Ukraine's allies a chance to assess Russia's invasion almost one year on. . There will be warm words of support for Kyiv. But there will also be questions about the extent and duration of Western resolve as economic pressures grow.. ",

The storm first hit northern Denmark and southern Norway, battering the coastal area of Rogaland and forcing schools on the Norwegian coast to close early. Ferries were cancelled between northern Denmark and Norway.. A number of flights to and from Copenhagen airport were cancelled or delayed and train services in Jutland in western Denmark were badly affected. . North Jutland police said roofs had been badly damaged and the large number of incidents meant they could respond only the most critical situations.

Train services between the south-western city of Malmo and Gothenburg were cancelled and drivers were urged not to make unnecessary journeys.. The Swedish prime minister's plane had to turn back and make an emergency landing at Stockholm's Arlanda airport during the afternoon, Swedish radio reported. .

Health Minister Asen Medzhidiev described the conditions inside the truck: \"There has been a lack of oxygen to those who were locked in this truck. They were freezing, wet, they have not eaten for several days.\". Police believe those discovered were from Afghanistan and were being illegally smuggled to Serbia..

        "content": "Wagner has recruited heavily in Russian prisons, and Mr Kirby most casualties were poorly trained convicts.. Despite the casualties, Wagner has made gains around the city of Bakhmut.. Some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place around the eastern city, with Wagner mercenaries heavily involved in Russian efforts to capture it.. Ukrainian troops say Wagner fighters have been sent into attacks in large numbers over open ground, and a Ukrainian army spokesperson said Moscow has failed to evacuate wounded and dead soldiers - leading to \"places where their bodies are just piled up\".. But capturing Bakhmut could allow Russia to make advances to bigger cities further west, like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.. However, Mr Kirby - the US National Security Council spokesman - suggested further advances could prove difficult given the gains made in Bakhmut had taken months to achieve and come at a \"devastating cost that is not sustainable\".. He also questioned military significance of the city. . \"It is possible that they may end up being successful in Bakhmut, but it will prove of no real worth to them because it is of no real strategic value,\" Mr Kirby told reporters.. Elsewhere, UK intelligence officials have estimated that Russian regular forces and Wagner troops may have suffered between 175,000-200,000 casualties - including 40,000-60,000 deaths.. The high number of deaths was \"almost certainly\" due to \"extremely rudimentary medical provision\", the UK's defence ministry said.. The Wagner Group was much smaller before the war, with just 5,000 fighters, most of whom were experienced former soldiers.. It started recruiting tens of thousands of fighters last year - largely from prisons, according to the US - as Russia had trouble finding troops for its invasion of Ukraine. Half of those convicts have probably been wounded or killed, UK officials say.. But last week, Mr Prigozhin, the group's founder, announced it would stop recruiting in prisons. The move followed longstanding tensions between Wagner and the Russian military.. \"The number of Wagner units will decrease, and we will also not be able to carry out the scope of tasks that we would like to,\" he said.. Mr Prigozhin has blamed Moscow's \"monstrous bureaucracy\" for slowing down progress in Ukraine, and accused the Russian army of unfairly taking credit for previous Wagner successes.. Wagner is believed to have started operations in 2014 in the annexed Crimean Peninsula and has since operated elsewhere in Ukraine, in Syria and across Africa. It has been accused of brutality and war crimes.. ",

Police found a commando-style knife and an army vest in Bouyer's car and guns were later found at his home.. Nine other members of the group were cleared. . During the trial, the court heard about racist online conversations in which they discussed migration, their fear about civil war, and their hatred of Mr Macron.. In one conversation, a mother of three boasted about her ability to storm the presidential palace with the help of 500 Russian soldiers.. The group were also suspected of plotting attacks against mosques and migrants.. \"I was so furious, so angry that I might have said that,\" one defendant, a 55-year-old woman, told the court when asked about an idea of kidnapping and burning Muslims.. The chief prosecutor called the group an \"incubator of violent action\", and while some of their views could appear \"eccentric\", the \"threat was real\". . But defence lawyers said the group were marginalised people from the countryside, all supporters of the anti-government Yellow Vest movement. One lawyer accepted there was \"hatred\" expressed by some in the group, but said that it was driven by \"social distress\". .
