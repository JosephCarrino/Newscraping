        "content": "The US European Command said the crash on Tuesday was the result of an \"unprofessional act by the Russians\".. US and allied forces will continue to operate in the area, it added. There is no word on the incident from Russia.. \"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,\" the US statement said. . Several times before the collision the Su-27 fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\".. MQ-9 Reaper drones are large unmanned aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan designed for high-altitude surveillance.. Shashank Joshi, defence editor for the Economist magazine, said the Russians may have been trying to intimidate the drone as it was hoovering up their communications. . White House spokesman John Kirby said Russian intercepts of US aircraft were not uncommon over the Black Sea, but it was the first time that one had resulted in a crash. . Tensions have risen in the region ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . ",

        "content": "The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January.. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington.. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an \"epidemic\".. But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives.. Mr Biden's executive order  - which does not require the approval of Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks.. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: \"While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.\". The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over \"red flag\" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it \"would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives\", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will \"double down on the progress made\" in last year's bill..

        "content": "The workers are striking over the Macron government's proposals to raise the pension age from 62 to 64.. Other cities including Nantes, Rennes and Le Havre are also affected.. Refuse collectors joined the pension strikes a week ago and the Paris authority says half of the city's districts, which are covered by council workers, have been hit by the action. Three waste treatment sites have been blockaded and a fourth partially closed.. On Monday, the Paris authority said 5,600 tonnes of waste had yet to be collected.. One commentator on Europe1 radio described the situation as an all-you-can-eat buffet for the six million rats of Paris, double the human population.. In the 10 districts covered by private companies the service was running almost normally, Paris council said. Some reports indicated activists were trying to prevent collections from going ahead.. And one private company was also seen on Monday night by news channel BFMTV picking up waste in one of the big central districts, the sixth, which is normally covered by council workers. Similar bin collections were going on in two other districts on the western fringe of the city.. Leading council official Emmanuel Grégoire said the situation was complicated but the authority was prioritising intervention for public safety, with a focus on clearing food markets, bin bags lying on the ground and ensuring pedestrian safety.. \"The strike triggers a change in rat behaviour,\" specialist Romain Lasseur told Le Parisien newspaper. \"They'll rummage around in bins, reproduce there, and leave their urine and droppings. We have a worrying health risk for refuse collectors and the general population.\". The capital's bin workers are due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue their action. Refuse collectors currently retire at the age of 57 because of difficult working conditions and under the reforms they would have to work for two more years.. Opponents of the Socialist mayor of Paris have seized on the strike as only adding to an existing crisis. . \"Anne Hidalgo promised to double the clean-up budget and Parisians clearly see Paris becoming dirtier and dirtier,\" complained Rachida Dati who runs the seventh district for the right-wing Republicans. . France's unions have stepped up action against the government's unpopular retirement reforms which are currently going through parliament.. Several operators at French refineries were on strike on Tuesday for a seventh day in a row, but only a small proportion of French petrol stations have had to close.. The measures were backed by the upper house or Senate on Saturday and will next go to a joint committee of MPs from both houses on Wednesday to decide on the final text. A final vote could reach the National Assembly and Senate on Thursday.. President Emmanuel Macron's party lacks a majority in the lower house so victory on the bill is by no means secure. . The government needs 287 votes, and even if it can persuade all its 250 MPs to back the reforms it will still need to find another 37 lawmakers from other parties to back the higher pension age.. Many of those extra votes are likely to be Republicans and the government is keen to avoid forcing through the legislation without a vote, which it could do by triggering a 49:3 article of the constitution..

        "content": "Is this the start of a financial crisis?. US stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, and some of the US regional banks saw big gains. . Regulators in the UK, the US and Asia have acted quickly to try to contain any fallout from SVB's demise.. The Bank of Japan moved to keep financial markets stable after its leading stock index fell 2.1%.. Investors have been worried that other banks may be exposed to similar problems.. Until last week's shock collapse, SVB was a relatively little-known bank - it was the 16th largest in the US.. However, a decision to invest in assets such as government bonds when interest rates were at record lows left SVB exposed to huge losses when central banks started raising rates.  . There is concern that other banks could be caught out in the same way. . Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"I think SVB was a badly-run bank that took too much risk in one sector and was caught out by higher interest rates which if managed properly it would not have been.. \"But higher interest rates will bring more challenges to banks, the economy and start-up firms for sure.\" . In the US, shares in a number of regional banks had plunged on Monday on worries over wider problems. But as trading began on Tuesday, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank - which had seen its share price tank by 62% on Monday - jumped 50%, one of a number of firms whose shares were staging a recovery.. The three main indexes were also positive, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading almost 1% higher in early afternoon trade in New York, the S&P 500 up more than 1% and the Nasdaq roughly 2% higher. . The rally followed steep losses overnight in Japan, where major lenders such as the country's largest bank MUFG, had seen their share price tumble by more than 8%. . An index of Japanese banking stocks, known as the Topix Banks Index, plunged by 7.4%, despite reassurances from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). . \"Japanese financial institutions' direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,\" said a BoJ official. . The European Stoxx banking index also opened lower on Tuesday but then recovered to .  nearly 3% higher.. Separately Credit Suisse's share price continued to tumble after it admitted it found \"material weaknesses\" in its internal controls over financial reporting. It also announced that it would slash its bonus pot - although it said bankers will still get a share of 1bn Swiss francs (£900m).. Credit Suisse's share price fell by 1.9%.. In the UK, bank shares - which saw sharp falls on Monday - were all mostly higher by Tuesday afternoon. The FTSE 100 closed up almost 1.2%.. But shares in HSBC, which rescued SVB's UK business for £1, closed down 1%.. SVB was taken over by US regulators at the weekend after a surprise sale of some bonds last Wednesday sparked a run on the bank. . By the end of Thursday, customers of the bank - mainly in the technology sector - . .. New York-based Signature Bank, which focuses on the cryptocurrency industry, also collapsed at the weekend.. There is now speculation that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will curb an interest rate rise next week to quell turmoil in the banking sector. . The Fed has been raising interest rates to calm the pace at which prices are rising - which is known as inflation.. On Tuesday, new figures revealed that the annual rate of US inflation eased to 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January.. The US Fed has been raising its key interest rate by as much as 0.75 percentage points, although in February its rate-setters voted for a smaller 0.25 percentage point increase. . ",
