        "content": "Mexico, which is prone to earthquakes, has highly specialised civilian and military teams which are often deployed to help when disasters strike.. The dogs won the hearts of Mexicans during the country's 2017 quake, when they saved several lives.. A yellow Labrador Retriever named Frida gained international fame when she was seen searching for survivors in Mexico City wearing protective goggles and boots. . The navy credited Frida with saving 12 lives and locating 40 bodies in operations across Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala and Ecuador.. While Frida died of old age last year, at least one of her canine colleagues from the 2017 Mexico quake will form part of Mexican Navy team travelling to Turkey.. Ecko, a Belgian Malinois, was seen at the airport in Mexico City with his navy handler.. But the deployment is not just a military one. The civilian search and rescue group Los Topos de Tlatelolco (The Moles of Tlatelolco) is also on its way.. The group of highly experienced volunteers had messaged Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard offering their help. . Within hours, Mr Ebrard responded that transport had been arranged for them with the help of the Turkish embassy in Mexico City.. The foreign minister also posted a video of a member of the Red Cross with his four-legged companion on board the plane. . , Ángel Daniel Hernández says he has been training his German Shepherd Rex since he adopted him five years ago.. Mexico is not the only country sending dogs to help with the rescue efforts in Turkey and Syria. . Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Libya, Poland, Switzerland, the UK and the United States are all also deploying canines with their handlers. . The animals are often used in areas where the use of heavy machinery could cause the rubble to collapse further, putting the lives of survivors at risk.. The dogs are trained to sniff out humans and alert their handlers by barking and scratching the ground where the smell is strongest. . Mexican officials say their mission is \"to save lives\" and while the dogs can detect the smell of bodies as well as that of those who are buried under the rubble alive, the hope is that their quick deployment will result in rescues rather than recoveries.  .

        "content": "The post said the sailors retrieving the debris on Sunday were part of the Navy's specialist explosives team.. The device will now be examined to see whether it was indeed spy equipment.. US officials have described the balloon as being about 200 ft (60m) tall, with the payload portion comparable in size to regional airliners and weighing hundreds - or potentially thousands - of pounds. . China has repeatedly insisted that the \"airship is for civilian use and entered the US due to force majeure - it was completely an accident\".. The discovery of the balloon set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off a weekend trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years - over the \"irresponsible act\". . The balloon was retrieved off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a day after being shot down by a fighter jet.. The navy said the debris was spread over seven miles (11km) of the Atlantic Ocean, and two naval ships - including one with a heavy crane for recovery - were sent to the area. However, the photos reveal the piles of balloon material were able to be pulled aboard by hand.. The US military has also deployed unmanned underwater vehicles as part of the search effort. . Experts say that the wreckage of the balloon could provide the US with valuable insight into Chinese aerial surveillance technology and techniques, allowing them to better understand what the balloon was capable of and how it transmitted information. . Efforts to recover the balloon's equipment, however, have been complicated by the need to ensure that US personnel are kept safe from potentially dangerous materials, such as explosives or battery components. . US defence officials first announced they were tracking the strange object on Thursday, and waited until it was safely over water before shooting it down.. Footage on US TV networks showed the balloon . .. On Friday, the Pentagon said a .  - this time over Latin America with reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. Colombia's Air Force says an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. ",
