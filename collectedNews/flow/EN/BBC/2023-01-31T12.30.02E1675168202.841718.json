        "content": "Protests are taking place across France, after a first day of action attracted more than a million people.. The unions said half the country's teachers had joined the strike.. The Macron government is pushing ahead with its pension age reforms in the face of opinion polls that suggest two-thirds of voters are opposed to the changes, which begin their passage through National Assembly next week.. Without a majority in parliament, the government will have to rely on the right-wing Republicans for support as much as the ruling parties' own MPs.. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon said France was at a crucial point and predicted an even greater number of protesters than on the first day of action on 19 January. Street protests are expected in at least 200 towns and cities and a reported 11,000 police have been deployed to cover the demonstrations.. Ahead of the main protest in Paris, big turn-outs were reported in Toulouse, Marseille and Nice in the south, and Saint Nazaire and Nantes in the west.. There was severe disruption to transport, with one in three high-speed trains running and only two driverless metro lines operating normally in Paris. Large crowds were reported on one of the main overground lines in the capital.. The CGT union said at least three-quarters of workers had walked out at the big TotalEnergies oil refineries and fuel depots. Power plants reported reduced production after workers went on strike at the main electricity company EDF.. One of the main teachers' unions said some 55% of secondary school teachers had walked out. High school pupils staged protests outside some schools and students said they would occupy Sciences Po university in Paris in support of the strikers.. \"A lot of French people feel that working is more and more painful. It's not that they don't want to work, they don't want to work in these conditions,\" Sciences Po political scientist Bruno Palier told the BBC.. The government has indicated it may move some way on the detail of the reform but has refused to give in on the main thrust of the raising the retirement age by two years to 64.. \"Any kind of reform that is going to ask people to work longer will be unpopular, but we've been elected on this reform,\" said Christopher Weissberg, an MP in President Macron's Renaissance party. . At 62, France's retirement age is lower than most other countries in Western Europe. Italy and Germany have moved towards raising the official retirement age to 67, while Spain's retirement age is 65 and in the UK it is 66.. In France, very few workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments, but there are now only 1.7 workers paying into the shared pension fund per person in retirement.. \"We have a universal system, and the system has to pay for itself. If not, it's weakening and if it's weakening, at some point, people will lose their pension,\" Mr Weissberg warned.. Economist Prof Philippe Aghion said the reforms were necessary because France had a structural deficit of some €13bn ($14bn; £11bn) and raising the retirement age would also help increase the rate of employment in France.. \"That will give the government credibility to make some investments that it needs to make in schooling, in the hospital system that it needs to improve, and more investment in innovation and green industrialisation,\" he told the BBC..

        "content": "The court petition disputes a 2016 amendment to Lisa Marie's will that ousted Priscilla as the estate trustee. . The document misspelled her mother's name and had a signature that appeared unusual, Ms Presley's lawyers argue. . In a filing to the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for the 77-year-old said that she only became aware of the \"purported 2016 amendment\" after Lisa Marie's death. . Replacing her as trustee would mean she was no longer overseeing her daughter's assets.. It is not clear how much that estate is worth but various lawsuits in recent years suggest Lisa Marie's finances were in turmoil, . The amendment to her will that is now in question removes her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaces them with two of her children Riley, 33, and Benjamin Keough. . Benjamin Keough died in 2020 at the age of 27. Riley Keough is an actress with credits including 2020 film The Devil All the Time and the Amazon series The Terminal List.. According to the legal challenge, Ms Presley argues that the amendment was never delivered to her during her daughter's lifetime, as specifically required by the will. . The amendment to Lisa Marie's will also \"misspells her mother's name\" and bears a signature by Lisa Marie that \"appears inconsistent with her usual and customary signature\", says the court filing seen by the BBC.. This video can not be played. Watch: Lisa Marie Presley - \"Music has been important for me my whole life\". Her lawyers also argue that the amendment was neither witnessed nor notarised.. \"Based on the foregoing, the Purported 2016 Amendment should be deemed invalid and the Trust, as amended and completely restated in 2010 is the controlling and authoritative document and its terms administered,\" the petition reads.. The legal action comes less than a week after the surviving family of Lisa Marie Presley attended a public memorial service for her at the family's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. . At the service, Priscilla read a poem that she said was written by one of Lisa Marie's three daughters. All three of them, including Riley, were present for the service. . Lisa Marie's cause of death has not yet been revealed by the Los Angeles County coroner. . ",

Rhino numbers in Africa have dropped significantly in recent decades to feed demand for rhino horn in China and Vietnam.. Poachers killed 61 black and 26 white rhinos mainly in Etosha, where 46 rhinos were found dead, Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said.. \"We note with serious concern that our flagship park, Etosha National Park, is a poaching hotspot,\" Mr Muyunda said.. International criminal gangs now use sophisticated equipment to track and tranquilise the animals before hacking off the horn, leaving them bleeding to death.. Poaching in South Africa and Botswana has led to wildlife teams sawing off the rhino horns in order to keep them alive.  . For many generations rhino horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine despite there being no proven medical benefit. . Poaching is also being fuelled by demand in Vietnam, where horns are displayed as a sign of wealth.. The most endangered is the black rhino with just over 5,000 still alive.. However, elephant poaching in Namibia has declined from a high of 101 in 2015 to four last year.. This video can not be played. Colchester Zoo welcomes birth of Southern white rhino calf. ",
