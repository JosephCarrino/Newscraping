        "content": "El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, was linked to the abduction, torture and beheading of several IS hostages in Syria, including journalists and aid workers.. On Thursday, after an 11-day trial, he was found guilty of lethal hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder.. Elsheikh was the highest profile IS fighter to stand trial in the US.. Hostages nicknamed the Sudanese-born Londoner and two other men the Beatles - after the rock band - because of their UK accents.. The group's actions are said to have resulted in the deaths of four American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig.. They are also blamed in the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto.. Some of the victims were beheaded, with their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The killings triggered outrage around the world.. Elsheikh was the only one of the three militants to go on trial in the US, after Alexanda Kotey pleaded guilty to his own charges last September and Mohammed Emwazi was killed in a 2015 drone strike in Syria. Aine Davis, an alleged fourth member, is currently imprisoned in Turkey.. Four rows in the courtroom were permanently reserved for former hostages and their family members.. It was tense inside the courtroom when everybody got news of a verdict. The jury had been deliberating for five-and-a-half hours. David Haines' daughter Bethany was shaking as she sat down.. When the guilty verdict came through, the families quietly sobbed, as did the former hostages. They held each other's hands.. Diane Foley closed her eyes and sighed with relief. Steven Sotloff's father Art smiled and said: \"This is good.\" For them, it's been a long road to justice.. Elsheikh showed little emotion - which he has always done in the trial - as his fate was sealed.. Over the course of the trial, several of them took the stand for the government, depicting the Beatles as a cohesive unit that revelled in brutality.. Witnesses recounted receiving random beatings, being given dog names and being forced to sing a parody of the Eagles' pop song \"Hotel California\" retitled \"Hotel Osama\".. Families also detailed their painstaking negotiations with the group, with Marsha Mueller telling the court how she and her husband had \"begged\" for their daughter Kayla's life in emails.. Lawyers for Elsheikh, meanwhile, claimed that he \"a simple Isis fighter\" who went to Syria alone on behalf of \"suffering Muslims\".. Outside the courtroom, Diane Foley - whose son James was executed on camera, with the video widely distributed by IS - told the BBC she was feeling \"relief and a tremendous sense of gratitude that mercy and justice has prevailed\".. \"This is a big day for accountability,\" she said. \"We will never stop hostage taking without accountability.\". Mike Haines, whose brother David also died in the group's captivity, said Thursday's result marked the end of \"an eight-year chapter of pain\" for his family.. \"This unanimous judgement is a triumph for society over ills like terrorism and helps differentiate us from the hateful, divisive ideologies that fuel these individuals,\" he said.. \"It must also act as a warning to anyone else seduced by the false glamour of extremism.\". Elsheikh's extradition to Virginia was part of a complex negotiation between the US and UK.. As part of the agreement, he will not face the death penalty - but his conviction on all eight charges means he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.. He will be sentenced in August but must also appear in court on 29 April for victim impact statements read during Kotey's sentencing.. John Bishop talks maturity and working class representation.

If convicted, he faces life behind bars.. The suspect \"committed a heinous and premeditated attack on ordinary New Yorkers during their morning subway commute\", said US Attorney Breon Pearce in a statement announcing the charges. . Police alleged the defendant donned a gas mask and threw two smoke grenades on the floor of a Manhattan-bound N train before opening fire around 08:30 (12:30 GMT) local time on Tuesday. . He is accused of shooting 10 people and injuring at least another 13.. The suspect escaped after the attack, police said, but left behind several incriminating personal items, including a key to a U-Haul van that he had rented, as well as a bank card with his name on it. There was also a Glock 9mm handgun legally purchased in Ohio under the name \"Frank Robert James\".. This video can not be played. He reportedly called police himself to report his whereabouts on Wednesday, US media said, citing sources in law enforcement. . The suspect, who had recent addresses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, had nine previous arrests in New York and three in New Jersey, police said on Wednesday. . No details about his alleged motive have yet been provided. . According to prosecutors, he published a variety of videos online making statements about the New York City subway system, occasionally addressing New York City Mayor Eric Adams as he complained about the \"homeless situation\" on subway cars. . In one video, prosecutors said, the accused said: \"And so the message to me is: I should have just gotten a gun, and started shooting.\" . NYPD acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that the cameras were not working at three stations during the attack because of what the department described as a technical issue.. But it said claims that the lack of station footage had delayed the manhunt were \"unfair and misleading\".. NYPD said that cameras in other parts of the subway system had helped track the suspect's movements.. John Bishop talks maturity and working class representation.

        "content": "Mr Depp has sued his ex-wife over a story she wrote in which she described herself as a victim of domestic violence. He denies any abuse. . Ms Heard filed a $100m counterclaim.. In testimony recorded in February and played for jurors on Thursday, Ms Anderson said she had seen the famous couple for several therapy sessions between October and December 2015. Ms Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 after just 15 months of marriage. . The psychotherapist described a volatile dynamic between Mr Depp and Ms Heard, with both threatening to walk out of sessions amid arguments. . In sessions without Mr Depp present, Ms Anderson said, Ms Heard reported physical assault at the hands of her then-husband. On one occasion Ms Heard came to her office with several small bruises on her face, she testified. . On more than one occasion Ms Heard initiated violent interactions in an effort to prevent Mr Depp from leaving, Ms Anderson said.. \"It was a point of pride to her, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,\" Ms Anderson told jurors. \"If he was going to leave her to de-escalate from the fight, she would strike him to keep him there, she would rather be in a fight than have him leave.\". Ms Anderson said that Mr Depp was often interrupted by Ms Heard during the therapy sessions.. \"Ms Heard had a jackhammer style of talking,\" the clinical psychologist said. \"She was very amped up. He had trouble talking at a similar pace. He was cut off a lot.\". Ms Anderson testified to both Ms Heard and Mr Depp's family history of domestic violence. Ms Heard was beaten by her father, she said, and Mr Depp was beaten by his mother. . Mr Depp had been \"well controlled\" for decades before meeting Ms Heard, Ms Anderson said, and did not engage in violence with past partners. \"With Ms Heard, he was triggered. They engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse.\" . At issue in the trial is Ms Heard's 2018 opinion piece in the Washington Post, describing herself as a \"public figure representing domestic abuse\". Mr Depp says the article - which does not mention him by name - is defamatory and derailed his career.. Jurors have so far been presented with duelling accounts of Depp and Heard's relationship. . Ms Heard's team has portrayed Mr Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. . Mr Depp's team has presented Ms Heard's claims of domestic violence as a \"hoax\" and a calculated strategy to ruin his reputation.  . Also on Thursday, a former personal assistant to Ms Heard, Kate James, testified about what allegedly happened when she asked her then-boss for a salary increase. . Ms James said: \"She [Ms Heard] leapt up out of her chair, put her face approximately four inches from my face. She was spitting in my face, telling me how dare you ask me for the salary you're asking for.\". The trial, expected to last at least six weeks, is being broadcast live and will involve a number of high-profile witnesses, including James Franco, Paul Bettany and Elon Musk..

        "content": "That scheme will initially focus on single men crossing the Channel in boats or lorries from France.. The prime minister said it would \"save countless lives\" and break the business model of traffickers, but campaigners have called the plan \"inhumane\".. Two more migrant crossings were recorded on Friday morning despite thick fog, the BBC's Simon Jones said.  . Andrew Griffith MP - director of the No 10 policy unit - said the new scheme would not require new legislation and could be implemented under \"existing conventions\".. He told BBC Newsnight it could therefore be launched \"in weeks or a small number of months\".. He added that, if the flow of illegal migration could be stopped, it would leave \"lots of capacity for the very generous safe and legal routes\" into the UK.. The Rwanda scheme is part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats.. The Royal Navy has taken operational command of the Channel from UK Border Force in an effort to detect every boat headed to the UK.. Some 562 people on 14 boats made the journey on the day the new scheme was announced, according to the Ministry of Defence. No one making the crossing is believed to have arrived on UK soil \"on their own terms\", it added.. Last year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,404 in 2020.. Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force, said it could be weeks before it became clear if the \"radical\" new scheme was feasible.. He told BBC Breakfast the government was likely to face a legal challenge when people are put on aircraft bound for Rwanda.. \"But then I'm not sure what the answer is to stopping the boats… because if we don't do something, then more people are going to drown,\" he said, adding the UK was potentially facing its biggest asylum intake ever.. In a speech on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the agreement with Rwanda would provide \"safe and legal routes for asylum\".. \"Economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the UK, while those with genuine need will be properly protected,\" he said.. He said the scheme would cover anyone who had arrived in the UK illegally since the start of this year.. No one we initially spoke to yesterday seemed to know about the Rwanda announcement - but it wasn't long before word spread.. Soon a group of men was asking us lots of questions: \"When will this happen? Why? If I come from Afghanistan will it still apply to me?\". Shafi, who told me he fled Afghanistan, said: \"[Rwanda] is a lot worse place than Afghanistan, there is no future for us in Rwanda.\". But I didn't meet anyone who said the government's plans would prevent them from trying to cross the Channel, including Shafi, who said he had no choice.. Many of these men have already faced huge risks to get this far and are willing to risk their lives crossing the Channel on a small boat.. The risk of being sent to Rwanda, at this stage, seemed like just another thing to factor in down the line.. More than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged the government to scrap the plan, describing it in an open letter as \"shamefully cruel\".. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said it would do little to deter desperate people and \"only lead to more human suffering\".. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract the country from the Partygate scandal with an \"unworkable, unethical, and extortionate\" scheme. . The Lib Dems said the government was \"slamming the door\" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford called the plan \"absolutely chilling\".. Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was \"not much more than a short-term solution\".. Questions are also being raised about the price of the scheme, with .  reporting a cost of £20,000 to £30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda.. But justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove declined to give such a figure, telling BBC Breakfast it would depend on several factors.. He said the UK was spending nearly £5m a day on hotels, while the new scheme would initially cost £120m, with more money to be given later.. A similar programme in Australia cost an estimated £460m in 2021 but successfully resettled only 239 people - a cost of around £1.9m per person. . Concerns are being raised about the human rights record of Rwanda and its president, Paul Kagame.. Mr Pursglove said Rwanda was a progressive country which wanted to provide sanctuary and had made \"huge strides forward\" in the last three decades.. The minister said it was now one of only two countries in the world with a female-majority parliament and had an antidiscrimination law running \"right through its constitution\".. However, just last year the UK government expressed concern at the United Nations about Rwanda's \"continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom\".. Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International UK, said sending people to the east-African nation was \"the very height of irresponsibility\".. Yolande Makolo, a spokesperson for Rwanda's government, told the BBC it is a \"safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights\".. According to an agreement between the two governments, people sent to Rwanda will get accommodation and support. They will be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times..

        "content": "Three Israeli police were hurt, they said.. The flashpoint site is deeply important to Muslims and Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount, and is at the heart of competing historical claims.. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have soared recently after deadly attacks in Israel and Palestinian deaths during subsequent Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank.. A 17-year-old Palestinian wounded on Thursday during an Israeli operation in the area of Jenin in the northern West Bank died on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said. . More than 20 Palestinians, many identified as gunmen, have been killed since Israel stepped up sweeps in the West Bank, centring on Jenin district, after a Palestinian killed three Israelis in Tel Aviv last Thursday. . That attack was the fourth in Israel by Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in just over two weeks. The killings have left 12 Israelis and two Ukrainians dead, marking the deadliest period of attacks in Israel for more than 15 years and leaving the country on edge.. Israeli police said dozens of Palestinians, some carrying flags of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, marched on the compound at about 04:00 (01:00 GMT) then started throwing stones and fireworks. . The police said they waited until Muslim Friday prayers had ended before entering the site to disperse the rioters, who had started throwing stones towards the Western Wall below the compound, where Jewish worshippers were.. The police tweeted video showing fireworks exploding inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and masked youths throwing stones towards officers. . Israel's foreign ministry tweeted video showing masked Palestinians inside the Qibli mosque (also known as al-Aqsa Mosque) throwing objects with the sound of a bang followed by a spray of sparks.. The foreign ministry denied reports on social media that police had entered the mosque building itself during the violence. Hours later footage from inside the mosque building showed Israeli police and Palestinians there with the scene more calm.. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned Israel's actions at the compound, saying it held it \"fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences\". . The clashes come after militant groups in Gaza called for \"hundreds of thousands\" of Palestinians to converge on the compound on Friday \"to protect our nation and our mosque\". . Last year Hamas, which governs Gaza, fired rockets towards Jerusalem following clashes at the mosque compound after weeks of unrest in the city, triggering a devastating 11-day war with Israel.. The compound is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and is also considered, in its entirety, as al-Aqsa Mosque. It is the third holiest site in Islam. . The same ground is sacred to Jews as the location of two biblical temples, and is the holiest site in Judaism. The question of rights there is one of the most contentious issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and between Israel and the wider Muslim world.. The recent surge in violence comes at a particularly volatile time, with the start of the Jewish festival of Passover on Friday night coinciding with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Christian festival of Easter.. Passover traditionally sees an increase in visits by religious Jews to the site, which are viewed by Palestinians as provocative.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach.. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by the offer.. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: \"I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it.\" . He added that he had a \"Plan B\" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean.. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. \"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" he said.. On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own.. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to \"unlock\" the company's \"extraordinary potential\" and that if his offer was not accepted, \"I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\". He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be \"utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote\". . Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: \"I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects.\". The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: \"What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?\". Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the \"unsolicited, non-binding\" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer.. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder.. Asset management firm Vanguard Group .  that its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot.. This video can not be played. Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive.. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley.. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be \"toying with the company to some extent\".. \"The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think.\". He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders.. \"To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution.. \"I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,\" he added.. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer.. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach.. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. . But details have emerged of an \"all hands\" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. . The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being \"held hostage\". . I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. \"I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,\" they said.. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. \"I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,\" they said. . Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer.. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe..

He says many fellow priests who followed Patriarch Kirill in Moscow are doing the same because of the Church leader's stance on the war.  . Father Pluzhnik and his family fled under artillery fire and now have a temporary new home in the town of Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine.. \"When the war started, I was waiting to hear from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the 'father' of our church. But first there was no reaction at all, and then there was worse,\" he says.. \"Patriarch Kirill blessed the Russian army and gave his blessing to the war. It was not just him but the majority of priests of the Moscow Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church] including some that even have Ukrainian roots. I was in shock.\" . As well as having failed to unequivocally condemn the killing of innocent people in Ukraine, or call for a ceasefire, the Patriarch has held large televised services in Moscow to bless Russian troops. He has also suggested in sermons that the Kremlin's war is a righteous one about the future of Christianity.. \"What is happening today is much more important than politics,\" he said last month. \"We are talking about human salvation, about where humanity will end up and on which side of God the Saviour.\". There are religious undertones in much of the Kremlin's narrative justifying its invasion of Ukraine. It is a fight for the conservative ideals of the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow, against an immoral outside world. President Putin has said Ukraine is not only an \"inalienable part\" of Russia's history and culture - but also its \"spiritual space\".  . The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has said he finds Patriarch Kirill's sentiment concerning.. \"There are elements in the Russian Christian tradition that can become really toxic when they get in their head a particular kind of Christian nationalism, a sort of messianic approach to the fate of the nation,\" said Dr Williams during a visit to western Ukraine this week..

They met refugees who had fled the horrors in the eastern part of the country.. Dr Williams has long studied and written about the positive contribution of the Russian Orthodox Church, and appears deeply saddened by the role the Moscow Patriarchate is playing in the war.. \"I think that the increasing influence in the Patriarchate of Moscow of ultranationalist ideals - often including a strand of anti-Semitism - has been going on for some time. . \"And it has now expressed itself in this very uncritical support of Russian national ambitions, a very aggressive attitude towards many other Orthodox churches. The writing has been on the wall for some time,\" he said.. Patriarch Kirill has echoed President Putin's claim that Russian speakers and followers of Moscow's Russian Orthodox Church living in eastern Ukraine need liberating after years of oppression.. \"Our brothers and sisters were really suffering, they suffer for their loyalty to the Church,\" said Patriarch Kirill a week into the war.. But Father Pluzhnik, a Russian speaker and a follower of the Moscow Patriarchate all of his adult life, is angered by those claims.. \"When I hear them say they are protecting us and fighting some 'Holy War', I think they are either blind, or they are not serving God but the devil,\" he says.. \"We were living peacefully until they came. But far from protecting us they bombed and tortured and killed. Before the war, parishioners were completely free to choose what church they went to, they just went to the church closest to their home. For many of them it was not even a significant difference to go to a church that followed Moscow or not, they just wanted to pray to God. Now that has changed.\" . Dr Sergii Bortnyk, a professor at the Kyiv Theological Academy and an adviser to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, acknowledges that there has been a widespread movement of people and parishes across the country abandoning their loyalty to Moscow.. \"I think it is maybe half of the 12,000 parishes [of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine] that have said that they want to break away now,\" says Dr Bortnyk.. \"Patriarch Kirill has not said anything about all the Christians in Ukraine that have been killed, so I believe the members of our church are free to end their connection to him as the patriarch,\" he says.. \"The connection to all of our [Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox] Church in Ukraine to Moscow is in question now.\". The Kremlin's aim, backed by the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, had been to unite Russia and Ukraine in a single \"spiritual space\".. But the manner by which they have tried to achieve that appears to have had precisely the opposite effect.. ",
