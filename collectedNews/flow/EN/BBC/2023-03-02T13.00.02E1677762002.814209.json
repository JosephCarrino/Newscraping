        "content": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of \"burying\" a deal to allow some Ukrainian grain exports.. Earlier, Narendra Modi spoke for developing nations, saying those present had a responsibility to them.. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. Foreign ministers, including Mr Lavrov, Mr Blinken and China's Qin Gang, are in Delhi for the summit. A former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make them overlook their differences over the war. . \"We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,\" Mr Modi told the ministers gathered in Delhi, urging delegates to find common ground. . \"After years of progress, we are at risk today of moving back on the sustainable development goals. Many developing countries are struggling with unsustainable debts while trying to ensure food and energy security,\" he said.. \"They are also most affected by global warming caused by richer countries. This is why India's G20 presidency has tried to give a voice to the Global South.\". It was a rare address by Mr Modi in English - a sign of how seriously he wanted his message to be taken. He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions. . India's slogan for the G20 is \"One Earth, One Family, One Future\". Mr Modi called on delegates to take it to heart and focus on issues that unite them.  . Thursday's schedule includes sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency. . India will hope to mediate in what is likely to be a fractious meeting and make some progress towards a consensus on less politically contentious issues. But with Russia and the US expected to hold press conferences after the meeting, it's likely that divisions over Ukraine will leave a lasting impression. . Last week, G20 finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on a closing statement at their meeting in the city of Bangalore (Bengaluru), in the first ministerial meeting in the run-up to the leaders' summit later this year. . It was left to India to release a chair's summary which noted \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine within the group. The foreign ministers' talks are likely to face similar hurdles.. It was evident from Mr Modi's speech opening Thursday's meeting that India wanted to deliver agreements that could help the developing world and fuel its global ambitions.. But experts say Delhi will also have the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war, now into its second year, with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together. . Delhi has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms.. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. It has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of more than a billion people.  . But it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.. Mr Modi's statement on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit last autumn was viewed as indirect criticism of Russia. \"Today's era is not of war,\" he told the meeting in Uzbekistan in the presence of President Vladimir Putin.. Despite the efforts of Mr Modi and his team, tensions over Ukraine dominated statements from some G20 members even before the meeting started.. \"This war has to be condemned,\" Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. . \"I hope, I am sure that India's diplomatic capacity will be used in order to make Russia understand that this war has to finish.\". On Wednesday, India's top diplomat Vinay Kwatra said that while the war in Ukraine would be an important point of discussion, \"questions relating to food, energy and fertiliser security, the impact that the conflict has on these economic challenges that we face\" would also receive \"due focus\". . Strained relations between the US and China are also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.. ",

        "content": "It is a growing issue for people in the area, her lawyer told BBC News. . The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",

        "content": "The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders.. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea.. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea's son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk. . The OCCRP claimed in a .  that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports.. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material.. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials.. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.  . NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa.. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle.. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. . The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa's Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled . .. The story examined Mr Ayuk's involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians. . After the story was published, the M&G's web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet's entire website for a morning in response to the complaint. . M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website. . Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\".. Last November during the UN's climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called . .. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN's flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk's US fraud conviction. . The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication.. Two weeks later, Climate Home News' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered.. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed. . Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles.. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\". Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered.. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\". . Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\". When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims. . Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication.. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.. ",
