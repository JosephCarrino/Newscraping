Quebec Premier Fran√ßois Legault told local media: \"All my thoughts are with the children, with the parents and with the employees.\".

        "content": "He commanded an anti-drone unit in occupied Luhansk, but had also been one of the founders of a mercenary group fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014. . He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull.. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol.. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an \"anti-Russian state\", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died. . Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon). . He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist. . The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline.. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired into the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances.. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed.. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them.. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, \"when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless\"..

        "content": "Officer Demetrius Haley took two photos of Mr Nichols, sharing them with at least five people, the documents show.. He is one of five Memphis policemen who have been charged with second degree murder.. The documents, which were first reported . , span more than 100 pages, and reveal for the first time the repeated misconduct of each of the officers.. They used excessive force, the reports say, when they tasered, pepper sprayed, punched, kicked and hit Mr Nichols with a retractable baton - and then left him lying on the ground, injured, needing urgent medical attention.. Demetrius Haley was the first officer to approach Mr Nichols, a 29-year-old father, FedEx worker and keen photographer, on 7 January.. \"You forced the driver out of his vehicle while using loud profanity and wearing a black sweatshirt hoodie over your head,\" the documents, released by the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission reads.. While Mr Nichols was handcuffed and slumped against an unmarked police car, Haley stood over him and took two photos, the report says. He then shared them in a text message with a civilian employee, two fellow officers and a female acquaintance. . The report does not state who the fifth recipient was, but a sixth person was subsequently identified during an investigation.. The documents describe how Haley and the other officers were \"laughing and bragging\" about their involvement in the incident, while Mr Nichols was left injured and lying on the ground. . It adds that, contradictory to the officer's claims, Mr Nichols never swore at them or showed any \"violent threats\".. The report also accuses Haley of making \"untruthful\" claims and omissions in his own incident report, such as failing to mention that he kicked Mr Nichols while he was on the ground.. \"Your on-duty conduct was unjustly [and] blatantly unprofessional,\" it said.. As well as the five officers charged with murder, a sixth has also been fired, and a seventh unnamed officer has been suspended.. However as many as 13 Memphis police officers could be disciplined for \"policy violations\", an attorney for the city said on Tuesday.. Three emergency medical workers have also been fired for not providing Mr Nichols with adequate care.. Tyre Nichols' death sparked protests in the US, and the Memphis Police Department disbanded its so-called Scorpion unit, of which all the officers were part of, within days of his death.. ",
