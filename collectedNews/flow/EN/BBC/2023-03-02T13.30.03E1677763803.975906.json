        "content": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of \"burying\" a deal to allow some Ukrainian grain exports.. Earlier, Narendra Modi spoke for developing nations, saying those present had a responsibility to them.. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. Foreign ministers, including Mr Lavrov, Mr Blinken and China's Qin Gang, are in Delhi for the summit. A former Indian diplomat told the BBC India would have to \"do something special\" to make them overlook their differences over the war. . \"We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,\" Mr Modi told the ministers gathered in Delhi, urging delegates to find common ground. . \"After years of progress, we are at risk today of moving back on the sustainable development goals. Many developing countries are struggling with unsustainable debts while trying to ensure food and energy security,\" he said.. \"They are also most affected by global warming caused by richer countries. This is why India's G20 presidency has tried to give a voice to the Global South.\". It was a rare address by Mr Modi in English - a sign of how seriously he wanted his message to be taken. He made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine but acknowledged that discussions would be affected by geopolitical tensions. . India's slogan for the G20 is \"One Earth, One Family, One Future\". Mr Modi called on delegates to take it to heart and focus on issues that unite them.  . Thursday's schedule includes sessions on food security, development co-operation, terrorism and humanitarian assistance - a reflection of India's priorities while it holds the G20 presidency. . India will hope to mediate in what is likely to be a fractious meeting and make some progress towards a consensus on less politically contentious issues. But with Russia and the US expected to hold press conferences after the meeting, it's likely that divisions over Ukraine will leave a lasting impression. . Last week, G20 finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on a closing statement at their meeting in the city of Bangalore (Bengaluru), in the first ministerial meeting in the run-up to the leaders' summit later this year. . It was left to India to release a chair's summary which noted \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine within the group. The foreign ministers' talks are likely to face similar hurdles.. It was evident from Mr Modi's speech opening Thursday's meeting that India wanted to deliver agreements that could help the developing world and fuel its global ambitions.. But experts say Delhi will also have the delicate task of balancing its non-aligned policy on the war, now into its second year, with pleas to other nations to find ways to work together. . Delhi has resisted pressure and continued with its strategy of not directly criticising Russia, which is India's largest supplier of arms.. It has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. It has also defended its decision to increase its oil imports from Russia, saying it has to look after the needs of more than a billion people.  . But it has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine.. Mr Modi's statement on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit last autumn was viewed as indirect criticism of Russia. \"Today's era is not of war,\" he told the meeting in Uzbekistan in the presence of President Vladimir Putin.. Despite the efforts of Mr Modi and his team, tensions over Ukraine dominated statements from some G20 members even before the meeting started.. \"This war has to be condemned,\" Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. . \"I hope, I am sure that India's diplomatic capacity will be used in order to make Russia understand that this war has to finish.\". On Wednesday, India's top diplomat Vinay Kwatra said that while the war in Ukraine would be an important point of discussion, \"questions relating to food, energy and fertiliser security, the impact that the conflict has on these economic challenges that we face\" would also receive \"due focus\". . Strained relations between the US and China are also expected to test India's ability to forge a consensus.. ",

        "content": "The coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the ex-workers and compensate others who were affected.. In response, Starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies.. \"We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review,\" Starbucks told the BBC.. In a more than 200 page decision, Michael A Rosas, who is a federal administrative law judge, also ordered Starbucks to rehire another worker that he ruled had been illegally forced out of their job.. Mr Rosas said Starbucks had showed \"a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights\" in response to union campaigns.. The judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay.. It also repeatedly sent high-ranking staff to stores \"in order to more closely supervise, monitor, or create the impression that employees' union activities are under surveillance,\" he said.. The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to safeguard employees' rights to unionise at their workplaces.. Michael Sanabria, a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, said the ruling was \"such a massive win for us, and for the labour movement as a whole.\". \"The decision results from months of tireless organising by workers... demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,\" said Michelle Eisen, a barista at another Starbucks location in Buffalo.. Last year, workers at around 270 of Starbucks stores across the US voted to join unions, despite opposition from the firm. Starbucks has around 9,000 company-owned stores in the US.. Union campaigners have accused the company of dragging its feet at the bargaining table and violating labour laws as it tries to shut down the movement.. Starbucks - which has long prided itself on its reputation as a progressive, worker-friendly employer - has said it respects workers' right to protest.. In recent months the company has raised pay and made other changes in response to the discontent.. This video can not be played. Watch: How UK strike rules could be about to change. ",

        "content": "A UN official said their submissions were \"irrelevant\" and \"tangential\" to the issues being discussed.. Self-styled guru Nithyananda is wanted in India in several cases, including rape and sexual assault.. Nithyananda, who claims he founded the United States of Kailasa (USK) in 2019, has denied the allegations against him.. USK's appearance at the UN events last week had made headlines in India. The Indian government hasn't publicly commented on the matter yet. . A UN official told the BBC in an email that \"USK representatives attended two UN public meetings in Geneva in February\". . The first was a discussion on the representation of women in decision-making systems, organised by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 22 February. USK representatives also participated in a second discussion on sustainable development, hosted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), on 24 February.. These general discussions are public meetings open to anyone who is interested, said Vivian Kwok, a media officer at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which oversees the two committees.. Ms Kwok said USK's written submission to CEDAW would not be included in their report as it was \"irrelevant to the topic of the general discussion\".. She also said that a statement made by a USK representative at the second discussion would not be taken into consideration as its focus \"was tangential to the topic at hand\".. A video on the UN website of the second session shows that when questions are invited from attendees, a woman introduces herself as Vijayapriya Nithyananda, \"the permanent ambassador of the United States of Kailasa\" and says she wants to ask a question about \"indigenous rights and sustainable development\".. She describes USK as the \"first sovereign state for Hindus\" established by Nithyananda, the \"supreme pontiff of Hinduism\". She also claims that USK has been \"successful with sustainable development\" because it provided necessities such as food, shelter and medical care for free to all its citizens. Her question is regarding what measures can be put in place to \"stop the persecution\" of Nithyananda and the people of Kailasa. . Others who asked questions at the discussion included a representative of an organisation called One Ocean Hub and a lecturer at Essex University.. Former Indian diplomat Preeti Saran, who holds the Asia Pacific seat at CESCR, was among the attendees at the discussion. The BBC has emailed her for comment.. Nithyananda, who was facing charges of rape, fled India in 2019. A female disciple had accused him of rape in 2010, after which he was briefly arrested before getting bail. He was charged in court in 2018.. Days before he left the country, a separate police complaint had also accused him of kidnapping and confining children at his ashram in the western state of Gujarat. . It's unclear where he escaped to and how he reached there. . That same year, he claimed to have bought an island off the coast of Ecuador and founded a new country called Kailasa, named after a mountain in the Himalayas that is considered the abode of the Hindu god Shiva. . At the time, Ecuador denied that he was in the country, and said that \"Nithyananda has not been given asylum by Ecuador or has been helped by the government of Ecuador\".. Nithyananda has not made any public appearances since 2019, though videos of his sermons are regularly released on his social media channels. .  reported last year that Nithyananda's UK representative had attended \"a glamorous Diwali party at the House of Lords\" on the invitation of two Conservative members.. News of the UN event began circulating on Indian social media after Nithyananda's Twitter account tweeted a photo of Vijayapriya Nithyananda.. A tweet thread later appeared to introduce USK's ambassadors to different parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and the Caribbean. . According to its website, Kailasa counts \"two billion practising Hindus\" among its population. It also claims to have a flag, a constitution, a central bank, a passport and an emblem.. ",

Rescue workers are still going through burned and buckled carriages, searching for victims.. This was the \"most difficult moment\", rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters news agency, as \"instead of saving lives, we have to recover bodies\".. The incident happened just before midnight on Tuesday. A passenger train carrying 350 people collide with a freight train after both ended up on the same track - causing the front carriages to burst into flames.. The railway workers' strike began at 0600 local time (0400 GMT), affecting national rail services and the subway in Athens. . Many in Greece see the crash as an accident waiting to happen, and the union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court on Thursday. He has denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on a technical fault.. The country's transport minister has resigned over the incident, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system that was not fit for the 21st Century.. Meanwhile, the government has promised an independent investigation that it promises will deliver justice.. But Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's suggestion that \"tragic human error\" was to blame has caused anger. . On Wednesday, rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the headquarters of the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters, who threw stones and lit fires in the streets. . At a silent vigil in Larissa to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had been long coming.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. \"This is an inadmissible accident.

Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday.. Kostas Malizos, a recently retired surgeon and Emeritus Professor at Greece's University of Thessaly, has returned to work to perform surgery on injured passengers.. \"Now we're in the phase of trying to match the human parts that were found at the site of the crash and match it with DNA,\" he told the BBC. . Local media have reported that more than 10 people are still missing, as Greece observes three days of national mourning.. But Professor Malizos has said it is difficult to tell how many people are unaccounted for. . He also questioned how the prime minister could have reached such a quick a conclusion that human error was to blame and said an extensive independent investigation was essential.  . \"It's a disaster, it's catastrophic. Families are crying tonight. Unfortunately, the majority of the lost people are young students. They left home, happy after the long weekend, to go for their studies or to see their relatives and never reached them.\".

The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B.
