        "content": "Rescuers have been working through the night to find survivors, the fire service said.. The cause of the crash is not known.. The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other train, leading to a fire in at least one of the carriages.. One survivor described how the carriage he was in was engulfed in flames as it rolled over following the crash. . \"We heard a big bang,\" passenger Stergios Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. . \"It was a nightmarish 10 seconds. We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis said.. \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\". Another passenger named Angelos Tsiamouras told local media the crash had felt like an earthquake. . \"It was a very powerful collision,\" the regional governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, told state-run television.. \"This is a terrible night... It's hard to describe the scene.\". Footage of the collision's aftermath showed thick plumes of smoke rising from derailed carriages. At least one of them was completely crushed.. Around 150 firefighters and 40 ambulances were at the scene, the fire service said.. Conditions for rescue workers were \"very difficult\" because of \"the severity of the collision\", fire service spokesman Vassilis Varthakoyiannis told reporters.. \"I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It's tragic. Five hours later, we are finding bodies,\" an exhausted rescuer emerging from the wreckage told AFP news agency. . \"We are living through a tragedy. We are pulling out people alive, injured... there are dead. We are going to be here all night, until we finish, until we find the last person,\" another volunteer rescue worker told ERT state broadcaster in comments cited by Reuters.. ",

        "content": "Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia.. Russian energy giant Gazprom operates a facility near the village of Gubastovo, about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, where the drone crashed.. Gazprom told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that its operations in the Kolomna district had not been interrupted.. The target of the drone in Kolomna \"was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, which was not damaged\", Mr Vorobyov posted on Telegram. . \"There are no casualties or damage on the ground. The FSB (Russian security service) and other competent authorities are investigating,\" he added.. Images shared by Russian media and officials show a damaged drone in a snow-covered field in front of a forest of birch trees. The area around the Gazprom facility is heavily forested.. The appearance of the drone matches that of the UJ-22 Airborne, a product of Ukrainian manufacturer Ukrjet.. Ukrjet says the vehicle has a range of 800km - enough for it to reach the Kolomna area from Ukraine.. A reverse image reveals no previous matches for the image, suggesting it is recent.. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, tweeted a photo of the drone. . \"It is more than 500km away from Russian border with Ukraine. Soon Putin might get very afraid to show himself in public as drones can reach far distances,\" he wrote alongside the photo.. If Ukraine was behind the Kolomna drone, it would be the closest attempted drone attack to the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.. It came as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had downed two Ukrainian drones in southern Russia.. The ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to use drones \"to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar region and the Adygea Republic\", adding that they were \"neutralised by electronic warfare units\".. Moscow has accused Ukraine of being behind attacks on Russian military infrastructure during the war, but Kyiv has not confirmed this. .  left three people dead, Moscow said. The Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.. Just weeks before, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the same airfield, which is home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine.. In August, a series of blasts rocked a military base in Crimea, in what was seen as a significant expansion of the conflict by Ukraine into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . President Vladimir Putin told the FSB on Tuesday to intensify its activity against what he said was increasing espionage and sabotage by Ukraine and the West.. He instructed the FSB to strengthen security in territories occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He said units deployed at the border must stop sabotage groups and prevent the passage of illegal weapons and ammunition.   . \"We need to beef up our counterintelligence in general, because Western special services have traditionally been very active in relation to Russia,\" he said.. \"And now they have put in additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly.\". Russia's defence ministry said its fighter jets were involved in a training exercise in the country's western airspace on Tuesday, hours after airspace over St Petersburg was closed due to reports of an unidentified object..

        "content": "\"It became evident that some people wanted all schools, especially girls' schools, to be closed down,\" the deputy health minister said on Sunday.. However, he later said that his remarks had been misunderstood.. The prosecutor general announced last week that he was opening a criminal investigation. However, he said that the available information only indicated \"the possibility of criminal and premeditated acts\".. Meanwhile, public frustration is continuing to grow.. The first poisoning took place on 30 November, when 18 students from the Nour Technical School in the religious city of Qom were taken to hospital.. Since then, more than 10 girls' schools have been targeted in the surrounding province.. At least 194 girls are reported to have been poisoned in the past week at four schools in the city of Borujerd, in the western province of Lorestan.. And on Tuesday another 37 students were poisoned at the Khayyam Girls' School in Pardis, near the capital Tehran.. The poisoned girls have reported the smell of tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill. . Earlier this month, at least 100 people protested outside the governor's office in Qom.. \"You are obliged to ensure my children's safety! I have two daughters,\" one father shouted in a video widely shared on social media. \"Two daughters... and all I can do is not let them go to school.\". \"This is a war!\" declared a woman. \"They are doing this in a girls' high school in Qom to force us to sit at home. They want girls to stay at home.\" . Some parents have said their children were ill for weeks after the poisoning.. Another video from a hospital shows a teenage girl lying dazed on a bed, with her mother beside her.. \"Dear mothers, I'm a mother and my child is in a hospital bed and her limbs are weak,\" says the distraught mother. \"I pinch her but she doesn't feel anything. Please don't send your children to school.\". At a news conference on Sunday, Deputy Health Minister Younes Panahi said the girls had been poisoned by chemicals that \"are not military grade and are publicly available\".. \"The pupils do not need any invasive treatment and it's necessary to maintain calm,\" he added.. Dr Panahi's comment that it was \"evident that some people wanted all schools... to be closed down\" appeared to confirm the government believed the poisonings were premeditated. . His subsequent denial suggested splits among officials over how to handle public anger when no suspects have been identified.. The poisonings have notably been concentrated in Qom, a city that is home to important Shia Muslim shrines and the religious leadership that forms the backbone of the Islamic Republic.. Since September, the clerical establishment has been challenged by the mass protests that erupted after the death in custody of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf \"properly\".. Some Iranians have speculated that if the schoolgirls are being poisoned as \"payback\" for their role in the unrest. Social media was flooded with videos showing schoolgirls ripping off their headscarves and chanting anti-establishment slogans.. Others have speculated that the poisonings are the work of hardliners who want to \"copy\" the Taliban in Afghanistan and the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria by terrorising parents to stop sending their girls to school. . \"Has Boko Haram come to Iran?\" former Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi asked in an Instagram post. . The reformist politician also warned that \"extremists will interpret the boundaries of government and religion in their favour\".. Iran's leaders have traditionally rejected criticism of its restrictions on women, such as the mandatory headscarf, and instead boasted about the number of women who attend university. But if young girls do not finish school, college is just a dream.. The comments of one schoolgirl, who says she has been poisoned twice, at the meeting with Qom's governor earlier this month highlighted how vague and misleading some of the statements from the authorities have been.. \"They [officials] tell us: 'All is good, we've done our investigation.' But when my father asked at my school, they told him: 'Sorry, the CCTV has been down for a week and we can't investigate this,'\" she said.. \"And when I was poisoned for the second time on Sunday, the school principal said: 'She has a heart condition, that's why she is hospitalised.' But I don't have any heart condition!\" . ",

        "content": "His main rival Atiku Abubakar polled 29%, and Labour's Peter Obi 25%. Their parties had earlier dismissed the poll as a sham, and demanded a rerun.. Mr Tinubu is one of Nigeria's richest politicians, and based his campaign on his record of rebuilding the biggest city, Lagos, when he was governor.. He was nevertheless defeated in the city by Mr Obi, a relative newcomer who mobilised the support of many young people, especially in urban areas, shaking up the country's two-party system.. Mr Tinubu won most other states in his home region of the south-west, where he is known as a \"political godfather\".. He campaigned for the presidency under the slogan: \"It's my turn\". . President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two terms in office, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east to a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. Mr Tinubu now has the task of solving these problems, among others, in Africa's most populous nation and biggest oil exporter.. After fighting military rule in Nigeria, escaping into exile and being one of the founding members of the country's democracy in 1999, Mr Tinubu will feel that he was destined to become president.. He was always the favourite to replace Mr Buhari - whom he helped become president - and the hurdles he has surmounted to get here will make this an even sweeter win for him.. He was not expected to win the party primary, yet he won.. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. Many said his decision to go with another Muslim as a running mate would prove an obstacle, but it was not.. Previously all major parties have split their presidential tickets with a Christian from the south and a northern Muslim in order to achieve broad support across this vast nation of 210 million people.. He will now have to prove that he can hit the ground running and that he is still the same formidable force who built modern Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.. Mr Tinubu will be taking charge of a crumbling economy, widespread insecurity and as the results map shows, a country retreating into regional and religious blocs.. ",

The three men arrested are said to have sailed the boat from Izmir in Turkey to Calabria in Italy despite bad weather conditions..

        "content": "It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.. China has denied a lab leak in Wuhan, calling the allegation defamatory. . Mr Wray's comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to \"be more honest\" about Covid's origins.. In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China \"has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. . \"And that's unfortunate for everybody,\" he said.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is a 40-minute drive from a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. Other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI's, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings.. US media reported on Sunday that the US energy department had assessed with \"low confidence\" that Covid leaked from a lab. The agency had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.. On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports \"a whole-of-government effort\" to discover how Covid began.. But he added that the US still lacks a clear consensus as to what happened.. \"We're just not there yet,\" he said. \"If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.\". An unclassified report released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.. For months, at the height of the pandemic, the lab leak hypothesis was widely dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theory. Top health officials publicly rejected the idea that the coronavirus could have been created in a lab before escaping.. A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\", but after deep criticism of that investigation, the agency's director-general called for a new inquiry, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\". Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019 and has since led to the deaths of nearly seven million people. . ",
