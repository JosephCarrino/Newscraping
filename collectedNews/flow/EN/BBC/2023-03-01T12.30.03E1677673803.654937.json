        "content": "Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia.. Russian energy giant Gazprom operates a facility near the village of Gubastovo, about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, where the drone crashed.. Gazprom told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that its operations in the Kolomna district had not been interrupted.. The target of the drone in Kolomna \"was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, which was not damaged\", Mr Vorobyov posted on Telegram. . \"There are no casualties or damage on the ground. The FSB (Russian security service) and other competent authorities are investigating,\" he added.. Images shared by Russian media and officials show a damaged drone in a snow-covered field in front of a forest of birch trees. The area around the Gazprom facility is heavily forested.. The appearance of the drone matches that of the UJ-22 Airborne, a product of Ukrainian manufacturer Ukrjet.. Ukrjet says the vehicle has a range of 800km - enough for it to reach the Kolomna area from Ukraine.. A reverse image reveals no previous matches for the image, suggesting it is recent.. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, tweeted a photo of the drone. . \"It is more than 500km away from Russian border with Ukraine. Soon Putin might get very afraid to show himself in public as drones can reach far distances,\" he wrote alongside the photo.. If Ukraine was behind the Kolomna drone, it would be the closest attempted drone attack to the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.. It came as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had downed two Ukrainian drones in southern Russia.. The ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to use drones \"to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar region and the Adygea Republic\", adding that they were \"neutralised by electronic warfare units\".. Moscow has accused Ukraine of being behind attacks on Russian military infrastructure during the war, but Kyiv has not confirmed this. .  left three people dead, Moscow said. The Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.. Just weeks before, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the same airfield, which is home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine.. In August, a series of blasts rocked a military base in Crimea, in what was seen as a significant expansion of the conflict by Ukraine into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . President Vladimir Putin told the FSB on Tuesday to intensify its activity against what he said was increasing espionage and sabotage by Ukraine and the West.. He instructed the FSB to strengthen security in territories occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He said units deployed at the border must stop sabotage groups and prevent the passage of illegal weapons and ammunition.   . \"We need to beef up our counterintelligence in general, because Western special services have traditionally been very active in relation to Russia,\" he said.. \"And now they have put in additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly.\". Russia's defence ministry said its fighter jets were involved in a training exercise in the country's western airspace on Tuesday, hours after airspace over St Petersburg was closed due to reports of an unidentified object..

        "content": "It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.. Many scientists have rejected the lab leak theory as lacking in evidence.. And other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI's.. Some of them have said - but with a low level of certainty - that the virus did not start in a lab but instead jumped from animals to humans.. The White House has said there is no consensus across the US government on the origins.. A joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) investigation in 2021 called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\".. However, the WHO investigation was deeply criticised and its director-general has since called for a new inquiry, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\". Mr Wray's comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to \"be more honest\" about Covid's origins.. In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China \"has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. . \"And that's unfortunate for everybody,\" he said.. In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\".. \"The conclusions they have reached have no credibility to speak of,\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is near a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at University of Glasgow.. \"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said this week.. On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports \"a whole-of-government effort\" to discover how Covid began.. \"We're just not there [at consensus] yet,\" he said. \"If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.\". Tensions in bilateral ties between the US and China have spiked in the wake of the recent spy balloon saga.. A bipartisan panel of US lawmakers this week kicked off a series of hearings on the \"existential\" threat of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.. The first session of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party focused on issues such as human rights and the US economy's dependence on Chinese manufacturing.  .

Officials have warned the final death toll could climb to more than 100.. Rescuers pulled another body from the sea, that of a man, on Tuesday morning.. The three men arrested are said to have sailed the boat from Izmir in Turkey to Calabria in Italy despite bad weather conditions.. Police say they allegedly asked the migrants for about €8,000 (£7,000; $8,500) each to make the long journey.. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for.. The coffins of the victims found so far have been laid out in a sports hall in Crotone - small white caskets for the younger victims and brown ones for the adults - to allow people to pay their respects. At least 12 children including a baby are among the victims.. Relatives of the victims living in northern Europe have arrived to try to get news of their relatives and identify bodies where necessary. . Rescuers said many of the migrants on board had come from Afghanistan, and Pakistan has said 16 of its citizens had survived the disaster, but four were missing.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. At least 36 people died and dozens more were injured in the head-on collision between two trains near the city of Larissa on Tuesday night.. The front carriages of a passenger train involved were mostly destroyed.. \"We heard a big bang,\" said 28-year-old passenger Stergios Minenis, who jumped to safety from the wreckage.. \"We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. . \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\". The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames, shortly before midnight local time. . It is being described as the worst train crash Greece has ever seen.. Survivors have described the panic and chaos of the crash, with one shaken passenger telling Skai television, \"the windows suddenly exploded\" and \"people were screaming and were afraid\".. \"Fortunately, we were able to open the doors and escape fairly quickly. In other wagons, they did not manage to get out, and one wagon even caught fire.\". Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Angelos Tsiamouras told Greek broadcaster ERT the crash had felt like an earthquake, and he smashed the train window using his suitcase. \"We broke the windows with our backs,\" another unnamed passenger said. . One survivor, Lazos, told the newspaper Protothema: \"I wasn't hurt, but I was stained with blood from other people who were injured near me.\".  An investigation has been launched to find out how it occurred.. Many of the 350 passengers on board the passenger train were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Sixty-six people were being treated in hospital for their injuries, including six admitted to intensive care.. \"It was a very powerful collision,\" the regional governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, told state-run television.. He said the first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two carriages caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\".. \"They were travelling at great speed and one (driver) didn't know the other was coming,\" the governor added.. As daylight broke, dozens of rescue workers aided with cranes were lifting the derailed carriages to search the wreckage for more victims. . \"I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It's tragic. Five hours later, we are finding bodies,\" an exhausted rescuer emerging from the wreckage told AFP news agency. .

        "content": "His main rival Atiku Abubakar polled 29%, and Labour's Peter Obi 25%. Their parties had earlier dismissed the poll as a sham, and demanded a rerun.. Mr Tinubu is one of Nigeria's richest politicians, and based his campaign on his record of rebuilding the biggest city, Lagos, when he was governor.. He was nevertheless defeated in the city by Mr Obi, a relative newcomer who mobilised the support of many young people, especially in urban areas, shaking up the country's two-party system.. Mr Tinubu won most other states in his home region of the south-west, where he is known as a \"political godfather\" - who helps put others into office.. He campaigned for the presidency under the slogan: \"It's my turn\". . In his acceptance speech, Mr Tinubu called for reconciliation with his opponents.. \"I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants to let us team up together. It is the only nation we have. It is one country and we must build it together,\" he said in a televised speech to the nation.. He said that they had the right to challenge the results in court but said that the lapses in the election \"were relatively few in number and were immaterial to affect the outcome of this election\".. President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two terms in office, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east to a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. Mr Tinubu now has the task of solving these problems, among others, in Africa's most populous nation and biggest oil exporter.. After fighting military rule in Nigeria, escaping into exile and being one of the founding members of the country's democracy in 1999, Mr Tinubu will feel that he was destined to become president.. He was always the favourite to replace Mr Buhari - whom he helped become president - and the hurdles he has surmounted to get here will make this an even sweeter win for him.. He was not expected to win the party primary, yet he won.. Many said his decision to go with another Muslim as a running mate would prove an obstacle, but it was not.. Previously all major parties have split their presidential tickets with a Christian from the south and a northern Muslim in order to achieve broad support across this vast nation of 210 million people.. He will now have to prove that he can hit the ground running and that he is still the same formidable force who built modern Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.. Mr Tinubu, known as \"Jagaban\" by supporters, will now be looking at unifying a country that is retreating into regional lines and religious blocs, as the election results show.. While he met the 25% requirement in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to show he was nationally accepted, the nature of the win indicates the absence of a truly national party.. Mr Obi won in Christian-dominated states and former strongholds of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the south, while the PDP support shrank back into its northern heartlands. . ",
