        "content": "Tens of thousands of people have spent a freezing fourth night in makeshift shelters, after losing their homes. . Turkey's president called the quake \"the disaster of the century\".. A major international relief effort is gathering pace. On Thursday the World Bank pledged $1.78bn (Â£1.38bn) in aid to Turkey including immediate finance for rebuilding basic infrastructure and to support those affected by the earthquakes. . Another donation came from the US, which pledged a package of $85m to both countries.  . Meanwhile, the efforts of 100,000 or more rescue personnel on the ground are being hampered by logistical hurdles including vehicle shortages and devastated roads.. UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the full extent of the catastrophe was still \"unfolding before our eyes\", especially in Syria where a long-running civil war has devastated the country.. On Thursday, the first UN humanitarian aid crossed the border into north-western Syria through Idlib's Bab al-Hawa crossing. . The crossing is the only way UN aid can reach the region without travelling through areas controlled by Syrian government forces.. Mr Guterres promised more help was on its way and he urged the UN Security Council to allow supplies to be delivered through more than one border crossing. . \"This is the moment of unity, it's not a moment to politicise or to divide but it is obvious that we need massive support,\" he said.. Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo in Syria after the quake, told Reuters on Thursday that her family was in desperate need of heating and more supplies, saying: \"Last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad.\". The White Helmets rescue group said the only UN convoy that reached the region did not contain specialised equipment to free people trapped beneath the rubble.. Officials said on Friday that 18,342 people had died in Turkey, surpassing the more than 17,000 killed when a similar quake hit northwest Turkey in 1999.. An earlier update from Syria had put the toll there at 3,377.. The tremor ranks among the most deadly natural disasters of the century - surpassing others such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.. Resat Gozlu, a survivor in south-eastern Turkey who is now living on the floor of a sports complex with his family, said rescue workers did not arrive until three days after the quake.. He said many remain trapped under the rubble and others died of hypothermia.. \"If this continues there could be serious health issues and illness,\" he told the BBC. . The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier warned a second humanitarian disaster will strike unless survivors can get access to shelter, food, water and medicine \"very fast\". . The WHO's Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, told the BBC the organisation's staff in Turkey's Gaziantep were sleeping in cars because \"there's still hundreds and hundreds of aftershocks\".. Dr Kluge said communities in Syria depended on water reservoirs, which were the first to fall. He said the reservoirs need to be replaced or the country faces cholera outbreaks - which he said was an issue before the earthquake.. ",

        "content": "Sex workers will also have to close their venues at 3am. . Local media reported that almost all councillors supported taking action to reduce nuisance to residents.. The city council also announced on Thursday that restaurants and bars would have to close by 2am on Fridays and Saturdays and no new visitors would be allowed into the old city district after 1am. . Currently, the sale of alcohol from shops, liquor stores and cafes in the red light district is illegal from Thursday to Sunday after 4pm. Now, the council will ask vendors to completely remove alcohol from their shopfronts during that time, or hide them from view.. It is illegal to consume alcohol in most public spaces in Amsterdam. . The Dutch capital is well known for its cannabis cafes and attracts millions of tourists a year. But locals have complained they attract street dealers and that drug and alcohol abuse is driving up crime rates.. Under current laws in the Netherlands it is a criminal offence to possess, produce or deal drugs. However, the use of drugs by a person over the age of 18 is not a criminal offence.. While it is illegal to sell or possess drugs, the Netherlands has a \"toleration policy\" that allows coffee shops to sell cannabis under strict conditions. One of those conditions includes that the shops must not cause any nuisance. . In addition to the new laws, the Amsterdam council will launch a \"stay away\" campaign in the spring to target tourists travelling to the capital for drugs, alcohol and sex purposes. . ",

        "content": "US military official: 'We think before we shoot'. It was equipped with multiple antennas capable of \"intelligence collection operations\", a senior State Department official said in a background briefing.. On Thursday, US lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution condemning China for the balloon. . China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes. . It has said the balloon was a weather device blown astray.. The US, however, believes the balloon is part of a wider fleet of surveillance balloons that has spanned five continents.. House of Representatives lawmakers called the balloon a \"brazen violation of United States sovereignty\" as the body voted 419 to 0 on Thursday morning to condemn its use.. Its appearance in US airspace has provoked a diplomatic crisis and led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. The US military used a fighter jet to shoot the balloon down over the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend.. China on Thursday said it was not aware of any wider fleet of surveillance balloons. The claim is \"probably part of the information and public opinion warfare the US has waged on China\", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.. China also took aim at US President Joe Biden after he said during a PBS interview that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was facing \"enormous problems\". Those remarks were  \"highly irresponsible and violate basic diplomatic protocols\", Ms Ning said. . The senior State Department official said on Thursday that high resolution images revealed the balloon - which was about 200 ft (60 metres) tall  - had large solar panels capable of operating \"multiple active intelligence collection sensors\" as well as antennas that were able to collect and geo-locate communications.. The US is considering taking action against groups linked to the Chinese government that were involved in the balloon's flight, the official said.. The latest US government information suggests that the craft indeed was some type of surveillance balloon, experts told the BBC. . \"The types of antennas are meant for surveillance technology and this is not something you would expect for any type of scientific mission,\" said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Civil and Systems Engineering.. It's still not possible to glean exactly what type of data China might have been trying to gather on the balloon mission, experts said, but it may have intercepted radio, cell phone and other communications from the military bases it flew over, said Matt Kroenig, the senior director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council. . The balloon's large solar panels - as well as the fact that it was able to hover over US airspace for long periods of time - is concerning, Dr Falco said. . \"They have a high-powered system that can do a lot of data relay,\" said Dr Falco. \"I don't know exactly what they were collecting, but all the mechanics are there for getting a lot of data back to their satellites.\". The US may have taken countermeasures to prevent China from gathering data, including jamming equipment, Dr Kroenig said. . The FBI said that its lab is helping process debris that has been collected, which has so far included parts of the balloon canopy, wires and electronic components collected from the surface of the sea.. Most of the balloon's \"payload\" - which would likely include surveillance gear and other items of interest to investigators - remains underwater off the South Carolina coast. Officials warn that processing the wreckage could take a long time, which could be prolonged by poor weather conditions. . This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. US intelligence, military and foreign policy officials began briefing members of Congress on Thursday about the balloon.. The hearings come amid mounting criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the incident from his political opponents. . On Wednesday, an open letter from Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Roger Wicker said they lack \"a clear understanding\" of the government's response to the balloon.. Speaking to senators, US Army Lieutenant General Douglas Sims said that \"the risk of Chinese intelligence collection was low to moderate\" as the balloon flew over the US.. The potential of harming civilians on the ground if it was shot down over land, conversely, was \"moderate to significant\". . Officials also defended the timing of the balloon's destruction, saying that doing so over rough terrain in Alaska or the cold waters of the Northern Pacific would have made recovery efforts difficult and dangerous. . At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South East Asia, East Asia and Europe..

        "content": "Watch: The moment SpaceX tests its powerful rocket system. Engineers conducted what's called a \"static fire\", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment.. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement.. Starship will become the most powerful operational rocket system in history when it makes its maiden flight.. This could occur in the coming weeks, assuming SpaceX is satisfied with the outcome of Thursday's test.. The static fire took place at SpaceX's R&D facility in Boca Chica on the Texas/Mexico border.. On Twitter Elon Musk said that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall.. But, he added, it was \"still enough engines to reach orbit\".. Even though this was not the full contingent of engines, it was still notable for the number of engines working in concert. The closest parallel is probably the N1 rocket that the Soviets developed in the late 1960s to take cosmonauts to the Moon.. It had 30 engines arranged in two rings. But the N1 failed on all four of its flights and was eventually cancelled.. The SpaceX Super Heavy booster, with all 33 modern power units, should produce roughly 70% more thrust off the launch pad than the N1. Even the US space agency Nasa's new mega-rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which flew for the first time back in November, is dwarfed by the capability being built into Starship.. Mr Musk has high hopes for the vehicle. The entrepreneur wants to use it to send satellites and people into Earth orbit and beyond.. Nasa has already contracted SpaceX to develop a version that can play a role in its Artemis programme, to once again land astronauts on the Moon. . Mr Musk himself is focused on Mars. He's long held the ambition to get to the Red Planet, to establish settlements and, as he puts it, to make humans \"a multi-planet species\". He's also talked about point-to-point travel, taking passengers from one side of the planet to the other in rapid time.. If Starship can be made to work it will be a game-changer, not just because of the mass it will be able to lift into space.. The concept is designed to be fully reusable, with both parts - the Super Heavy booster and the ship on top - coming back to Earth to fly, time and time again.. This means it could operate much like an airliner. The long-term cost savings compared with conventional, one-time-use rockets would be immense.. SpaceX will now review its data to understand why it couldn't fire all 33 engines on this occasion. It will also inspect the launch pad to see what, if any, damage occurred during the short firing. Previous, smaller-scale engine tests had fractured the concrete under the launch mount, requiring repairs. . Mr Musk has talked about an orbital attempt of the full Starship system in late February or March.. The ship, or upper-stage of the rocket, was removed for Thursday's test in case there was a catastrophic failure of the booster.. ",
