        "content": "The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv.. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials.. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a \"crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime\".. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions \"for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked\".. The announcement described Ms Tikhonova as \"a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry\". . Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, \"leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin\". . Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets.. \"We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,\" the official said.. \"We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them.\" . The US sanctions announced by the White House include:. Meanwhile the UK has announced . , including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow.. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases.. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not \"tolerate any indecisiveness\".. Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe \"war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses\" to back tougher sanctions. . He added that \"Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine\", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war.. Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; £833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion.. Some European member states, including Germany, are heavily reliant on Russian energy and had been reluctant to directly target the sector.. However, in a first, the . , which must be agreed by all 27 members. Europe buys around €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.3bn) worth of coal from Moscow every year. . Sentiment appeared to change after evidence of Russian war crimes emerged, with French President Emmanuel Macron joining calls for a ban on coal earlier this week. . The ban was suggested ahead of a range of sanctions set to be announced in coordination with the US and other G7 nations.. European member states are also expected to impose a \"full transaction ban\" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth €5.5 billion ($6bn; £4.59bn). . And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region.. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of \"waging a cruel and ruthless war\" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must \"sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point\". . But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a \"feeble response\" which is \"an invitation for more atrocities.\". \"Coal, four banks…a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,\" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter. .

        "content": "A 23-year-old Tigrayan trader told investigators how he was beaten up and left for dead in Rawyan by a patrol of Amhara Special Forces, who said: \"We will erase you from this land. This land is ours. This is the last time a Tigrayan will live in the area.\". The western part of Tigray has been largely inaccessible to journalists and aid agencies since the war in Tigray erupted in November 2020 - and all lines of communication have been blocked.. It is an area where land and boundary disputes between neighbouring regions and ethnic groups have long caused tensions and resentments.. The conflict - which followed a fallout between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and Tigray's dominant political party - has provided an opportunity to settle old scores.. After the war began, Amhara's forces, along with their allies in the Ethiopian army, quickly moved in, took control and a new administration was set up in western Tigray.. , is based on interviews with 423 people, mainly survivors of alleged abuses, and satellite images.. Amnesty and HRW says the evidence collected over a year shows that western Tigray has been the site of some of the worst atrocities committed during the 16-month war - and has been largely ignored.. In the first days of the offensive, one of the first large-scale massacres was in Mai Kadra on 9 November. It involved both sides and left around 229 of the town's residents - both Amhara and Tigrayan - dead. . Afterwards the report says Tigrayans were targeted in revenge attacks by Amhara security forces, their property was pillaged and occupied.. At this time Jamila told how some Amhara militiamen came into her hair salon in the town of Dansha early one morning as she was working. The 27-year-old was raped in front of her children, aged seven and two: \"They said: 'You Tigrayans should disappear from the land west of Tekeze.'\" . This refers to the River Tekeze, which splits the western zone of Tigray from the rest of the region.. Once in control of western Tigray, interviewees said the new authorities banned the speaking of Tigrinya and put in place policies to push Tigrayans out, distributing leaflets with a 24-hour or 72-hour ultimatum to leave or be killed. . Three survivors told investigators about the massacre of about 60 Tigrayan men near the Tekeze River Bridge on 17 January 2021 - an incident that prompted many people to flee.. Militias rounded up Tigrayan men in the town of Adi Goshu and took about 60 of them to the Tekeze River where they were lined up in rows and shot.. Mesfin said: \"They shot all of us, me included. I was shot in my right shoulder and right hand. Bodies were falling one after the other.. \"I woke up at around 4am... I saw so many dead bodies around me,\" the 57-year-old said.. \"Some cow herders found me when I entered the forest. They took me to the people hiding in the forest. They treated me there, until I recovered... I lost my son and son-in law that day.\". The report also details how Tigrayan livestock, crops and homes were targeted and how security forces have tortured and deprived people of food.. \"This campaign of ethnic cleansing was conducted through a series of human rights abuses, including mass detention and torture, sexual violence, extrajudicial killings, denial of humanitarian aid and forced expulsion of Tigrayans,\" Amnesty researcher Fisseha Tekle told the BBC.. The two rights groups say that hundreds of Tigrayans remain unlawfully detained and have called for their immediate release.. They also want militias to be disarmed, officials linked to the abuses suspended and have called for an African Union-led international peacekeeping force to be deployed to western Tigray.. The conflict has forced millions of people to flee their homes - and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine.. The war is continuing - though a humanitarian truce was declared less than two weeks ago that has seen several lorries of food make it to the capital of Tigray for the first time in months.. However, Amnesty says the western Tigray region is still not getting the help it needs.  . During the conflict both sides have been accused of atrocities.. In particular, Ethiopian and Eritrean forces were accused of carrying out massacres in Tigray's holy city of Aksum and using widespread sexual violence, while Tigrayan forces face accusations of war crimes when they invaded Amhara last year..

He contracted coronavirus and died weeks after being admitted to hospital with pneumonia.. His death was finally confirmed by parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on Wednesday, after two reports earlier this year had been discounted. . Zhirinovsky was, he said, always in the thick of things: \"A man who deeply understood how the world works and foresaw a lot.\". Zhirinovsky's brand of clownish ultranationalism kept Russians shocked and entertained during more than 30 years of his political career. . In the early 1990s he claimed he dreamt of the day \"when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean\". In one of his final appearances before MPs, he said Russia would invade Ukraine and predicted almost to the day when it would happen.. \"At 04:00 on 22 February you'll feel [our new policy]. I'd like 2022 to be peaceful. But I love the truth, for 70 years I've said the truth. It won't be peaceful. It will be a year when Russia once again becomes great.\". His career was laced with similar threats to other countries, from the Baltics and Germany to Japan and the Middle East. He achieved international notoriety when he threw juice in the face of a political rival, Boris Nemtsov, during a TV debate.. Before he entered politics, he ran a Soviet state-approved Jewish cultural organisation. His Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was the country's first official post-communist political party and was widely viewed first as a Soviet stooge. Russians and the West were shocked when his party won Russia's first democratic elections in 1993.. Political commentator Konstantin Eggert labelled him \"the Kremlin's pocket nationalist and scandal-monger\". With hindsight, said Eggert, his success in 1993 was a precursor of the \"barbaric revanchism\" that had led to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. Zhirinovsky told the BBC in 2018 that Ukraine was Russian territory: \"It's our territory; it's our people. It's part of our country.\". His career had declined in recent years - even though his party is widely viewed favourably by the Kremlin. . He secured a mere 5.6% of the vote in a 2018 presidential election that was marred by irregularities and by a ban on Russia's leading opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who is now in jail.. When a respected Russian journalist accused Zhirinovsky in 2018 of groping him 12 years earlier, the politician's son condemned the remarks as slander..

Watson Farley & Williams said they would be \"remembering and honouring\" him.. The alarm was raised on Monday afternoon by the family's 15-year-old daughter after the landslide killed her father and younger brother, leaving her mother and older brother critically injured.. The teenage girl was said to be \"extremely distressed\" and is being kept in hospital under observation.. The two bodies were recovered from the mountains, near the popular walking spot of Wentworth Falls, about 60 miles (96km) from Sydney, at about 09:30 local time on Tuesday.. Tour guide Graham Chapman said landslides are common in the Blue Mountains and have been made more likely by recent heavy rain.. \"This beautiful family from England were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's so sad,\" he said.. \"Maybe another 50 metres either side or a delay during the day, this wouldn't have happened.\". Torrential rain has returned to the Blue Mountains. Thick bands of low cloud have moved in, obscuring buildings and bushland.  . As the rain beats down near Wentworth Falls, car headlights occasionally emerge from the mist. But this popular tourist destination is mostly quiet: walking tracks and some roads have been closed. . Months of heavy downpours are likely to have been a key factor in the tragedy involving the family of five from Britain. . They came on a day of rare sunshine in a year that's been dominated in much of eastern Australia by storms and floods. . In this World Heritage area, the ground is sodden and signs warn of the dangers of rockfalls and landslips. The earth and the famous sandstone cliffs have become saturated, and still it rains. . Landslides here are not uncommon - but rarely, if ever, have they devastated the lives of an entire family. . The family had set out on the hike on Monday in bright, sunny weather but the Blue Mountains had previously been lashed by weeks of heavy rain.. Mr Chapman said: \"I've seen so many landslides I couldn't tell you how many. But the thing is with landslides here in the mountains, you don't actually get to hear about them a lot because it's so remote.. \"Here in the mountains, it can change in the blink of an eye and sadly for the English family, that's exactly what happened the other day.\". He said he had cried when he heard the news of their deaths, adding: \"We've only just opened up our international borders, and to know that that family has come to our country and that this has happened on our soil, man, it's just heart breaking.\". The family are understood to be members of the Zoroastrian religion, . .. Zubin Appoo, president of the Australian Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales, said the accident was \"beyond tragic\". \"Everyone is shocked and so many in our community are reaching out to offer support in any way they can.\". Mr Appoo said tributes to the family were \"flooding in\", adding that the religion had a small and tight-knit global community.. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident was \"tragic\" and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open.. The Department of Environment and Heritage in the state said the area was closed to the public until further notice and a \"comprehensive review\" would be undertaken.. It said it had a \"world-class\" programme in place to assess the risks of incidents such as landslides but \"it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks\"..

Under an edit function users could be able to fix typos or errors in a tweet without losing any replies, retweets or likes it has already gained.. Jay Sullivan, the company's vice president of consumer product, said it had been \"the most requested Twitter feature for many years\" in a thread on Tuesday. . However, he said the company was exploring how to build the feature \"in a safe manner\".. \"Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,\" he said. \"Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.\". During a talk in 2018, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said the firm would \"probably never\" add the feature amid concerns about transparency. . But rival social media platforms Facebook and Instagram already allow users to edit their posts, and Twitter's new boss Parag Agrawal appears open to the idea. .

Twitter polls are notoriously unscientific - yet Mr Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results. . In November last year, he asked his 80 million followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll concluded he should, and he did. . Mr Musk's poll on whether there should be an edit button on Twitter is being taken seriously by the chief executive of Twitter. \"The consequences of this poll will be important.

In the US, where mid-term elections will be held in November, it has also become a major political issue, weighing on President Biden's support.. Executives warned that there was \"no quick fix\" to the problem. . They said their investments will raise output this year, but warned that staffing and supply issues stemming from the pandemic meant it is taking longer to start new production.. \"What can be done to ensure vital energy products remain available and affordable?\" asked Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil. . \"While there is no quick fix, the answer in the near-term, until there are more widely available and affordable alternatives, is straightforward. We need to increase the supply of oil and natural gas.\" . Energy prices were already increasing before Russia's invasion, as firms struggled to respond to disruption from the pandemic, which prompted a dramatic collapse in demand in 2020, followed by a faster-than-expected rebound. . Oil prices are up roughly 70% from a year ago, accelerating in recent months.. New Yorker Doreen Aniakor says the dramatic rise in petrol prices means her car now costs $100 (£76.50) to fill. In response, she has stopped filling her tank in one go and started cutting off the engine at red lights to save fuel..

Republicans blamed policies backed by President Joe Biden for the higher costs, accusing him of an \"assault\" on the US energy industry with actions such as halting oil and gas leases on public lands.. \"High gas prices are a feature of President Biden's policies, not a bug,\" said Rep Cathy Morris, a Republican from Washington. \"Why? They want to usher in a green revolution.\". After questioning by Republicans, some executives said in their testimony that Mr Biden's push for green energy alternatives was chilling investment..

        "content": "Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, had claimed the \"Oh I\" hook in Sheeran's track was \"strikingly similar\" to an \"Oh why\" refrain in his own track.. After the ruling, Sheeran said such \"baseless\" claims \"are way too common\".. In a video on social media, he said there was now a culture \"where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim\".. He added: \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music.. \"Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year and there's only 12 notes that are available.\". This video can not be played. Shape of You was the UK's best-selling song of 2017 in the UK and is Spotify's most-streamed ever.. Judge Antony Zacaroli ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song.. He acknowledged there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\" in Shape of You and Oh Why, but said \"such similarities are only a starting point for a possible infringement\" of copyright.. After studying the musical elements, he said there were \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs, which \"provide compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".. He added that there was only a \"speculative foundation\" for the defence's case that Sheeran had heard Chokri's song before writing Shape of You. \"I find, as a matter of fact, that he had not heard it,\" he said.. Sheeran wrote his chart-topping track with two collaborators, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, who all denied having previously heard Oh Why.. The case dates back to 2018, when the trio asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed the copyright of Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. That led to an 11-day trial in London last month.. This ruling will come as a huge relief to Ed Sheeran, who took the unusual step of pre-emptively suing Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue in 2018 in an attempt to clear his name. . He was stung by the accusation that he'd deliberately copied another writer's work without giving them credit. On the witness stand, the star was often terse and abrupt as he explained how, in several other instances, he shared royalties with writers who inspired him. Even on Shape of You, he protested, some of the profits went to the writers of TLC's No Scrubs.. He later sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good and Blackstreet's No Diggity on the stand in an attempt to prove the melody he was accused of stealing was commonplace in pop music.. Chokri was more emotional. He said he felt \"robbed\" by an artist he respected, and that he wished the trial had never come to court. However, he remained adamant that Sheeran had heard and copied his song.. In the end, the judge disagreed. In order for copyright infringement to be proved, Chokri needed to prove that Sheeran had listened to his song - otherwise the similarities would just be coincidence. But Mr Justice Zacaroli said Chokri's team had failed to establish that Oh Why had ever graced Sheeran's speakers. . As a star who has faced his fair share of copyright claims, Sheeran will presumably hope this verdict makes future litigants think twice. . The Shape of You songwriters took legal action in 2018 after the track's royalties were frozen when Chokri and O'Donoghue asked the Performing Rights Society (PRS) to add them to the hit's credits as co-writers.. Shape of You earns Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon about £5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments having being frozen due to the dispute.. In his ruling, Mr Justice Zacaroli said Sheeran and his collaborators were justified in thinking the request from Chokri and O'Donoghue to be named as co-writers \"was a tactic designed to extract a settlement\".. After the initial legal action, Chokri and O'Donoghue launched a counter-claim alleging copyright infringement.. In a joint statement after the judgement, Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon said their mental health and creativity had suffered as a result of the case, as well as their wallets.. \"There was a lot of talk throughout this case about cost,\" they said. \"But there is more than just a financial cost.

He is thought to have founded Wagner and given it its name - his own former call-sign.. He is a veteran of the Chechen wars, a former special forces officer and a lieutenant colonel with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service.. The Wagner Group first went into action during Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, says Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King's College London.. \"Its mercenaries are thought to be some of the 'little green men' who occupied the region,\" she says. \"About 1,000 of its mercenaries then supported the pro-Russian militias fighting for control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. . \"Running a mercenary army is against the Russian constitution,\" she adds. \"However, Wagner provides the government with a force which is deniable. Wagner can get involved abroad and the Kremlin can say: 'It has nothing to do with us'.\" . Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says Wagner mainly recruits army veterans who need to pay off debts: \"They come from rural areas where there are few other opportunities for them to make money.\". Some suggest Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, secretly funds and oversees the Wagner Group. . Mercenary sources have told the BBC that its training base in Mol'kino in southern Russia is next to a Russian army base. . Russia has consistently denied Wagner has any connection with the state.. The BBC investigation that identified Utkin's links to the Wagner Group also links Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch known as \"Putin's chef\" - so-called because he rose from being a restaurateur and caterer for the Kremlin.. Many of Mr Prigozhin's companies are currently under US sanctions for what it calls his .   He has always denied any connection with the Wagner Group.. In 2015 the Wagner Group started operating in Syria, fighting alongside pro-government forces and guarding oilfields. . It has been . , supporting the forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar. It's thought that up to 1,000 Wagner mercenaries took part in Haftar's advance on the official government in Tripoli in 2019.. In 2017, the Wagner Group was .  (CAR) to guard diamond mines. It is also reported to be working in Sudan, guarding gold mines.     . In 2020, the US Treasury said Wagner had been \"acting as a cover\" in these countries for Mr Prighozin's mining companies, such as .  and .  - and placed them under sanctions.. Most recently, the Wagner Group has been . , in West Africa, to provide security against Islamic militant groups. Its arrival in 2021 influenced the decision by France to pull its troops out of the country. . Samuel Ramani says the Wagner Group has about 5,000 mercenaries in total operating across the world.  .

The United Nations and the French government have accused Wagner mercenaries of committing rapes and robberies against civilians in the Central African Republic, and the EU has imposed sanctions on them for this..

In the weeks leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is thought Wagner Group mercenaries carried out \"false flag\" attacks in eastern Ukraine to give Russia a pretext for attacking, says Tracey German..

Then he fell.\" . At that point, the teenager said, the soldier shot him in his left hand and he fell too. While he was on the ground, he said, he was shot again, this time in the arm.  . \"I was lying on my stomach, I couldn't see anything that was happening around me,\" Yuriy said. The soldier, he said, shot again, aiming at his head. \"[But] the bullet went through my hood.\" . Yuriy said the soldier shot again, this time at his father's head. But Ruslan was already dead. \"I had a small panic attack, lying there with my wounded arm underneath me. I saw that my hand was bleeding,\" he said.  . It was only after a while, when the soldier went behind a tank, that Yuriy got up and ran, he said. . The BBC has not independently verified the details of Yuriy's account, but it comes as evidence grows of atrocities committed by Russian forces while they were in control of Bucha and other towns north of Kyiv.. In Bucha alone, bodies of dead men were found lying in the street, many with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed. Others had their hands or legs tied behind their backs. Some had clearly been run over by tanks. . Many of the bodies were seen along a stretch of Yablonska St, just 2km (one mile) from the street where Ruslan is said to have been killed. . Yuriy's mother Alla told the BBC how she had gone to see her husband after the teenager returned home and told her what had happened. She thought Yuriy could be wrong, and that Ruslan was wounded, in need of medical help.  . \"My son begged me not to,\" Alla said. \"He said they would kill me too.\" . When she tried to walk down the street, she said, her neighbours stopped her. \"[They] told me not to go further, saying the Russians were killing everyone in the territories under their control.\" . The next morning, Alla got her mother to help. Wearing white scarves, they went to the site of the shooting. Her mother talked to Russian soldiers and they managed to get through. They finally collected Ruslan's body, and brought it home. . A photograph of the partially covered body, taken by Alla and shared with the BBC, appears to confirm Yuriy's testimony. It shows a gunshot wound to the right side of the chest, near the heart. . Ruslan, a lawyer, was 49 when he was killed. He was \"active in the community,\" Alla said. \"He couldn't just sit in the shelter and wait. So, he was volunteering and helping people.\" . They buried him in the garden of the family home.  . Yuriy said the soldier who killed him was clearly Russian. His uniform was dark green, he said, typical of the Russian army. \"I saw that on his flak jacket it was written 'Russia' in Russian,\" he said. . \"We were no danger to the military, we were civilians, wearing white scarves to show that,\" Yuriy said. \"It's very stupid.\".
