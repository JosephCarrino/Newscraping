        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. . However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's Chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Moscow has accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. . The French President, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday echoed this sentiment - saying that while \"nothing is excluded\" when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",

        "content": "The court petition disputes a 2016 amendment to Lisa Marie's will that ousted Priscilla as the estate trustee. . The document misspelled her mother's name and had a signature that appeared unusual, Ms Presley's lawyers argue. . In a filing to the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for the 77-year-old said that she only became aware of the \"purported 2016 amendment\" after Lisa Marie's death. . The amendment in question removes her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaces them with her children Riley, 33, and Benjamin Keough. . Benjamin Keough died in 2020 at the age of 27. Riley Keough is an actress with credits including 2020 film The Devil All the Time and the Amazon series The Terminal List.. According to the legal challenge, Ms Presley argues that the amendment was never delivered to her during her daughter's lifetime, as specifically required by the will. . The amendment to Lisa Marie's will also \"misspells her mother's name\" and bears a signature by Lisa Marie that \"appears inconsistent with her usual and customary signature\", says the court filing seen by the BBC.. This video can not be played. Watch: Lisa Marie Presley - \"Music has been important for me my whole life\". Her lawyers also argue that the amendment was neither witnessed nor notarised.. \"Based on the foregoing, the Purported 2016 Amendment should be deemed invalid and the Trust, as amended and completely restated in 2010 is the controlling and authoritative document and its terms administered,\" the petition reads.. The legal action comes less than a week after the surviving family of Lisa Marie Presley attended a public memorial service for her at the family's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. . At the service, Priscilla read a poem that she said was written by one of Lisa Marie's three daughters. All three of them, including Riley, were present for the service. . Lisa Marie's cause of death has not yet been revealed by the Los Angeles County coroner. . ",

As part of the policy change in Sichuan, unmarried individuals will also now be able to raise children.. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.. In 2016, China scrapped its controversial one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases even lost jobs. . In a culture that historically favours boys over girls, the policy also led to forced abortions.. But the changes that began in 2016 failed to halt the decline in the birth rate. Deaths outnumbered births . Now, there will be no limit on the number of children people can have in Sichuan, a province of 80 million people in the south west of the country.. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made boosting birth rates a priority. The government has offered tax breaks and better maternal healthcare to reverse or slow the falling rates. . It comes as China is still battling Covid-related .  The virus tore through towns and cities after the lifting of zero-Covid restrictions in December.. Neighbouring countries, including Japan, are also facing falling birth rates. Japan's prime minister says, as a result, .  of not being able to function as a society.. ",

Rhino numbers in Africa have dropped significantly in recent decades to feed demand for rhino horn in China and Vietnam.. Poachers killed 61 black and 26 white rhinos mainly in Etosha, where 46 rhinos were found dead, Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said.. \"We note with serious concern that our flagship park, Etosha National Park, is a poaching hotspot,\" Mr Muyunda said.. International criminal gangs now use sophisticated equipment to track and tranquilise the animals before hacking off the horn, leaving them bleeding to death.. Poaching in South Africa and Botswana has led to wildlife teams sawing off the rhino horns in order to keep them alive.  . For many generations rhino horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine despite there being no proven medical benefit. . Poaching is also being fuelled by demand in Vietnam, where horns are displayed as a sign of wealth.. The most endangered is the black rhino with just over 5,000 still alive.. However, elephant poaching in Namibia has declined from a high of 101 in 2015 to four last year.. This video can not be played. Colchester Zoo welcomes birth of Southern white rhino calf. ",
