        "content": "with a simple message: \"I'd love for him to get some sales.\" . The book jumped to No. 1 on Amazon's Serial Killer Thrillers list. . Her dad's response was: \"I'm ready for a nap.\". The viral video, which details Mr Richards' long journey to finishing the novel, Stone Maidens, has garnered more than 40 million views.. TikTok, a short-form video hosting platform, has helped fuel sales of hundreds of books in recent years, including through the hashtag #BookTok, which readers use to discuss their favourite authors and book picks. In 2021 alone, BookTok helped authors sell 20 million printed books, according to a New York Times report.. The news of his overnight fame has overwhelmed Mr Richards, who cried while reading the comments section of the TikTok post after his daughter told him it went viral.. His daughter cried, too, thanking fans for the purchases. \"Because of them, you're number one,\" she told her dad. . \"He doesn't even know what TikTok is,\" she added. . Mr Richards' daughter said her dad - who lives with his wife in Montpelier, Vermont - was content simply to have finished the novel, which was published in 2012, and tells the story of an FBI forensic anthropologist investigating a serial killer who strangles women and dumps their bodies in the ravines of southern Indiana. . The book may have been inspired by Mr Richards' previous work. He garnered true crime expertise while serving as a senior law clerk for an Indiana judge researching and writing drafts for published opinions, including one on the appeal of a serial killer sentenced to death, according to his Amazon biography. . Fans on TikTok were quick to praise the book, as well as its author's story. . \"I've never ordered something so fast in my life,\" one user said after seeing the heart-warming video. . After \"25 years of little hope\", Mr Richards' unexpected success should serve as a reminder to never give up, his daughter said in a later TikTok video. . \"These last couple of days... I can't understand it,\" Mr Richards said in the video, toasting the boost in sales with milkshakes. \"I feel so blessed.\". But Mr Richards is not taking too long a break to celebrate. He is now working on a sequel to the book, according to his Amazon biography. . ",

        "content": "The quake in neighbouring Turkey is known to have killed almost 40,000 people in the two countries.. Many Syrians have been angry over the lack of aid to their war-torn nation.. The government of President Bashar al-Assad has blamed difficulties in rescue efforts on the impact of Western sanctions imposed on the country.. But international aid groups say the key impediments are the Assad government's mismanagement and refusal to engage with all areas of the country.. More than 5,700 people are now known to have been killed in Syria by the 6 February earthquake.. In Turkey, the death toll has already exceeded 31,000.. More than one million people have been left homeless in Turkey, and in Syria this number could be much higher, aid organisations warn.. Rescue teams in both countries are now winding down rescue operations in the vast area, as chances of finding any more survivors are fading.. The UN made an announcement about the two new border crossings - in Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee on the border with Turkey - after high-level talks with President Assad in Damascus on Monday.. It said the crossings into rebel-held north-western Syria would initially be open for three months.. \"Very shortly we will use the other two crossings,\" Mr Guterres' spokesman St√©phane Dujarric told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme.. \"We hope that the agreement will last as long as we need to use it. We will start using it as quickly as possible and I don't want to make any assumptions, the only thing I want to assume is that people will put politics aside wherever they stand in this conflict.\". He did not give any further details on when the two crossings would open.. And Mr Dujarric defended the delay in waiting for Syria's permission to open the crossings.. \"It is our understanding that other aid organisations not affiliated with the UN have been using these border crossings. We have to operate within certain perimeters, that's the nature of the United Nations. . President Assad has made no public comments on the issue.. In the first few days after the quake, some supplies reached the government-controlled areas of Syria, primarily from friendly countries like Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.. But the devastated north-western rebel-controlled areas of Syria remain virtually cut off.. This is because international humanitarian aid to these parts can only arrive through a single crossing from Turkey or through the government-controlled areas of Syria.. This video can not be played. Watch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horror. ",
