        "content": "Fighter jets brought the craft down over US territorial waters on Saturday and debris is spread over a wide area.. The US believes the balloon was monitoring sensitive military sites.. Its discovery set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend's trip to China.. The Chinese authorities denied it was used for spying and insisted it was a weather ship blown astray. . Admiral Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Sunday he thought the Chinese military might have launched the balloon intentionally to disrupt Mr Blinken's trip to China. His visit would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.. Adm Mullen rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\". . \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Republican politicians. meanwhile, accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered.. Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN it was a \"brazen effort\" by China to embarrass the president ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday.. Brenda Bethune, the mayor of Myrtle Beach which is near to where the object was shot down, said: \"I do have concerns about how the federal government can allow a foreign adversary to fly uninterrupted from Montana to our doorstep.\". She said she hoped the government would explain how this happened and how they will prevent it from happening again.. The high-altitude balloon - thought to be the size of three buses - was shot out of the sky by a Sidewinder air-to-air missile fired from an F-22 jet fighter. It came down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT) on Saturday. . US TV networks broadcast the moment the missile struck, with the giant white object falling to the sea after a small explosion.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. Martin Willis said he was visiting Myrtle Beach when he filmed the fighter jet shoot down the suspected surveillance balloon. . He told the BBC he couldn't believe what he was witnessing. \"It was really exciting. It felt very historic,\" he said.. Police have warned people in the area not to touch or move any debris they find. \"Tampering could interfere in [the] investigation,\" Horry County Police Department said.. The remnants of the object landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than officials expected - and is spread over seven miles (11km).. Explaining the decision to shoot the balloon down, a US defence official said in a statement, that \"while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon's overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us\".. China's foreign ministry expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US's use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft\".. In a written statement, the Chinese government said it would \"resolutely safeguard\" the rights and interests of the company operating the balloon and that it reserved the right to \"make further responses if necessary\".. Mr Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk.. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast and advised mariners to leave the area.. Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty.. US military officials on Friday said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted over Latin America. The same day, Colombia's Air Force said an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. China has not commented publicly on the second balloon.. ",

        "content": "He added people with \"homosexual tendencies\" are children of God and should be welcomed by their churches.. His comments were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland.. Archbishop Justin Welby and Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, travelled with the Pope to South Sudan where they jointly called for peace in the war-torn country.. It is the first time the leaders of the three traditions have come together for such a journey in 500 years.. Archbishop Welby and Dr Greenshields praised the Pope's comments during a news conference with reporters on board the papal plane as they travelled from Juba to Rome.. \"I entirely agree with every word he said there,\" said Archbishop Welby, noting that the Anglican church had its own internal divisions over gay rights. . Last month the Church of England said it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to be married in its churches.. Expressing his own support, Dr Greenshields referred to the Bible, saying: \"There is nowhere in the four Gospels that I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whoever he meets, and as Christians that is the only expression that we can give to any human being in any circumstance\".. During the news conference Pope Francis repeated his view that the Catholic Church cannot permit sacramental marriage of same-sex couples.. But he said he supported so-called civil union legislation, and stressed that laws banning homosexuality were \"a problem that cannot be ignored\".. He suggested that 50 countries criminalise LGBT people \"in one way or another\", and about 10 have laws carrying the death penalty.. Currently 66 UN member states criminalise consensual same-sex relations, according to ILGA World - the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.. \"This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God,\" said the Pope.. \"God loves them. God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\". Under current Catholic doctrine, gay relationships are referred to as \"deviant behaviour\" and Pope Francis has previously . .. But some conservative Catholics have criticised him for making comments they say are ambiguous about sexual morality.. In 2013, soon after becoming Pope, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but added that homosexual orientation was not.. Five years later, during a visit to Ireland, Pope Francis stressed that parents could not disown their LGBT children and had to keep them in a loving family.. ",

        "content": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has said troops are fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman, in  east.. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister.. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party.. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry. . Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army.. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that \"war dictates personnel policies\". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries.. President Zelensky .  as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government. . At an earlier press conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February.. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine.. The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday.. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine.. \"I am sure that we will win this war,\" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, \"it will cost us more lives\". . Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat.. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area.. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were \"fighting to the last\".. Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago.. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region.. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months.. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: \"Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles.\" But, he added, \"we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning\".. The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town.. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire.. This video can not be played. Watch: Mum turns TV up to hide shelling from daughter. ",

        "content": "It is true that the fighting has become more static during typically cold conditions. . However, all signs seem to be pointing towards an upcoming Russian push. . Moscow has mobilised hundreds of thousands more men, as well as increased its production of weapons and ammunition. . Kyiv is expecting to see major attacks from the east and south as soon as 24 February, which would mark a year since the full-scale invasion. . So, if Russia does launch another offensive, what will it try to take?. It's the eastern city which has been grabbing the headlines because of the endless conflicting claims over who controls it. . For now, Kyiv isn't hinting at a tactical retreat. It claims the Russians are suffering about 500 casualties per day as they stage relentless attacks. Ukraine reckons its own losses are not as high.. Regular Russian forces appear to have replaced mercenaries from the Wagner Group as they continue to surround the city. For now, Ukrainian troops are continuing to hold it. . If or when the city falls, invading forces are expected to push towards the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. It could allow Moscow to capture the entire eastern Donetsk region, one of its official goals. . But that would involve capturing more than 4,000 square miles (10,360 sq km). In a period where Russia has been making minimal, costly gains, the Ukrainians would have to be seriously overpowered, or taken by surprise. . After trying and failing last November, Russian forces have started launching attacks on the small town of Vuhledar, also in the Donetsk region.. It sits on the south-eastern curve of the current battlefield and is significant for Moscow for two reasons. . Firstly, it's close to the only rail line linking the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russian-controlled territories in the east. It's from Vuhledar that Ukrainian forces have been firing artillery at Russian supply trains. . Vuhledar is like Bakhmut in that for the Russians it carries more symbolic than military significance. Ukraine is convinced Moscow is going to chase its two main goals as quickly as possible. . Alongside capturing the whole of Donbas (Luhansk and Donetsk regions), Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought to be looking to widen the land corridor he has seized between Crimea and Russia. . The capture of Vuhledar would certainly go towards those - but it would be more valuable to the Kremlin in a propaganda sense. Military milestones help the Kremlin to justify its \"special military operation\" back in Russia, as well as appease critics. . They also could provide President Putin with a political way out, if he can keep hold of what he seizes. . Away from the eastern front, the conflict line south of the city Zaporizhzhia is another direction Kyiv is worried about. . The concern is that Russian forces could push north towards the towns of Orikhiv and Pokrovsk (the latter is in Donetsk region). . If this were to happen, it would push back the firing positions of longer-range Ukrainian missiles which can strike deep into the land corridor Russia controls further south. . Given that American HIMARS have been able to travel up to 80km (50 miles), and are about to go up to 120km, the occupied cities of Melitopol and Tokmak are comfortably within Ukraine's range. . Moscow is also wary of a Ukrainian advance here too towards Melitopol. Kyiv has talked about the importance of the city before, saying its liberation would allow Ukraine to cut off Russian supply routes to Crimea. . However, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, has also admitted his troops don't have the numbers of equipment for such an attack.. This video can not be played. Building hit by missile in Kharkiv's Freedom Square. Despite being less than 25 miles from the border with Russia, Ukraine's second largest city in the north-east has never fallen into Moscow's control. . Like so many areas, it has been mostly torn apart from Russia's attempts to snatch it from Kyiv's control. Kharkiv's population has endured almost constant missile strikes and resulting blackouts throughout this winter. . Authorities say while there hasn't been an increase in nearby enemy forces, Russians have been shelling civilian areas more frequently. . Some officers in the local military have said they \"wouldn't be surprised\" if the Russians launched another attack, especially with the frozen ground.. While there is no guarantee Russia could take a city it has failed to penetrate over the past year, its capture would bring a significant strategic advantage. . Invading forces could seal the city off from Kyiv, which could prevent Ukrainian troops currently south of Kharkiv from retreating to the capital.. Ukraine's capital is still Russia's ultimate prize. However, this isn't 2022. . Last year, joint military exercises between Belarus and Russia turned into an advance on Kyiv when Moscow used its ally as a launchpad for its invasion. . At the start of this year there were fears of history repeating itself when both countries announced drills once more - this time in the form of \"defensive\" air force exercises north of Ukraine. . Belarus denied it had plans to join the invasion. Moscow rejected claims it had tried to force it. . Now, both the West and Ukraine seem to agree on there being no intelligence suggesting the capital could be under the threat it faced last year. Plus, Russia used its best-trained forces during its first attempt, when its goal was to topple the Ukrainian government. . \"We do not see formed assault groups capable of reaching Kyiv,\" said Ukraine's outgoing Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov.. \"Besides, it is impossible to capture Kyiv in principle. It is a large city with four million people, ready to defend themselves.\". If Russia indeed launches a large-scale offensive and gains momentum, Mr Reznikov's successor could give a different assessment.. ",
