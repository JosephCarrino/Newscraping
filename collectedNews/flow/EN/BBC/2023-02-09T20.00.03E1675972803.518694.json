        "content": "US military official: 'We think before we shoot'. It was equipped with multiple antennas capable of \"intelligence collection operations\", a senior State Department official said in a background briefing.. On Thursday, US lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution condemning China for the balloon. . China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes. . It has said the balloon was a weather device blown astray.. The US, however, believes the balloon is part of a wider fleet of surveillance balloons that has spanned five continents.. House of Representatives lawmakers called the balloon it a \"brazen violation of United States sovereignty\" as the body voted 419 to 0 on Thursday morning to condemn its use.. Its appearance in US airspace has provoked a diplomatic crisis and led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. The US military used a fighter jet to shoot the balloon down over the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend.. China has said the decision to shoot down the balloon was \"irresponsible\" and did not \"create a proper atmosphere for dialogue\" between the two countries.. High resolution images revealed the balloon - which was about 200 ft (60 metres) tall  - had large solar panels capable of operating \"multiple active intelligence collection sensors\" as well as antennas that were able to collect and geo-locate communications, the senior State Department official said on Thursday.. The US is considering taking action against groups linked to the Chinese government that were involved in the balloon's flight, the State Department official said.. The latest US government information suggests that the craft indeed was some type of surveillance balloon, experts told the BBC. . \"The types of antennas are meant for surveillance technology and this is not something you would expect for any type of scientific mission,\" said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Civil and Systems Engineering.. It's still not possible to glean exactly what type of data China might have been trying to gather on the balloon mission, experts said, but it may have intercepted radio, cell phone and other communications from the military bases it flew over, said Matt Kroenig, the senior director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council. . The balloon's large solar panels - as well as the fact that it was able to hover over US airspace for long periods of time - is concerning, Dr Falco said. . \"They have a high-powered system that can do a lot of data relay,\" said Dr Falco. \"I don't know exactly what they were collecting, but all the mechanics are there for getting a lot of data back to their satellites.\". The US may have taken countermeasures to prevent China from gathering data, including jamming equipment, Dr Kroenig said. . But it could have been \"too little too late\", Dr Falco said, adding that there was likely a gap in time before the US was aware of the craft and could take action. . This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. US intelligence, military and foreign policy officials began briefing members of Congress on Thursday about the balloon.. The hearings come amid mounting criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the incident from his political opponents. . On Wednesday, an open letter from Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Roger Wicker said they lack \"a clear understanding\" of the government's response to the balloon.. Speaking to senators, US Army Lieutenant General Douglas Sims said that \"the risk of Chinese intelligence collection was low to moderate\" as the balloon flew over the US.. The potential of harming civilians on the ground if it was shot down over land, conversely, was \"moderate to significant\". . Officials also defended the timing of the balloon's destruction, saying that doing so over rough terrain in Alaska or the cold waters of the Northern Pacific would have made recovery efforts difficult and dangerous. . At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South East Asia, East Asia and Europe..

        "content": "But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions - breaking policies set out by SpaceX.. A Ukrainian official said companies had to choose which \"side\" they were on.. They could join Ukraine and \"the right to freedom\", or pick Russia and \"its 'right' to kill and seize territories\", tweeted presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.. At an event in Washington DC on Wednesday, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell explained that Starlink technology was \"never meant to be weaponised\".. She made reference to Ukraine's alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use.. Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow's own drone attacks.. Russia has been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.. Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology \"for comms\", but said her intent was \"never to have them use it for offensive purposes\".. She said the company had taken steps to \"limit\" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details. . The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year. . After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media.. The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected.. They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit.. As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments.. In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position.. In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work. . \"SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,\" he wrote. . \"However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don't part.\" . ",

        "content": "He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels.. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move.. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives.. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing.. Mr Zelensky said that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public, and presidential office adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak later told Ukrainian TV that long-range missiles and attack aircraft would be supplied this year, although it was up to negotiations.. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had. . Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act \"within the entire formation of Nato\", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly.. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years.. \"Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,\" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the \"biggest anti-European force of the modern world\". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine.. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table.. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be \"game-changers\" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, \"the quicker this Russian aggression will end\", he explained.. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not.. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France \"determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights\". Chancellor Scholz added: \"The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war.\". Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results.. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was \"very little time\" to provide much-needed weaponry.. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. \"The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,\" Mr Rutte told the BBC.. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls \"provocations\".  . Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict.. \"We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,\" said Mr Peskov.. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a \"public bidding war\" of weapons systems for Ukraine.. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: \"Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.\" . Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was \"a long-term solution\" and that training pilots could take years..

        "content": "Leader Kim Jong-un was seen at the midnight parade with his young daughter elevated to his side.. Kim Ju-ae's appearance has fuelled speculation she's being positioned as the successor.. The number of long-range missiles shown in the parade has prompted concern. Analysts say such a number of the missiles - which can in theory hit as far as the US mainland - could potentially overwhelm US nuclear defences if each missile carried multiple war heads.. North Korea's media did not provide detail, but said such an arsenal demonstrated the country's \"mighty war deterrence and counterattack capabilities\".. Pictures published by North Korean media on Thursday morning appeared to show more than a dozen ICBMs rolling through the central square of Pyongyang - accompanied by an army of foot solders.. Some North Korea analysts said the display also included a new ICBM launcher which appeared to design to accommodate a solid-fuel missile. . Solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which are hard to defend against. . However, Kim's regime has never successfully tested long-range solid-fuel missiles.. \"This is one of North Korea's major nuclear modernisation goals,\" said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.. \"We should expect to see the first flight tests of longer-range solid fuel missiles in the coming months,\" he told the BBC.. He added the expansion of North Korea's ICBM arsenal presented potentially \"serious military planning challenges\" for the US in a conflict, as it would be difficult for the US to find and destroy all of North Korea's mobile ICBMs.. The parade comes after a record year of missile testing by North Korea in breach of UN economic sanctions. That has led to several flare-ups of tensions on the Korean peninsula.. The state's Korean Central News Agency reported the parade stressed the country's ability to face down its enemies \"nuke for nuke, confrontation for confrontation\".. Images published showed Mr Kim clad in a black coat and fedora inspecting rows of soldiers holding bayonets, and saluting as troops and missile units paraded past. . He was also photographed observing the parade from a balcony with Ju-ae by his side.. The elevation of Ju-ae - who is believed to be about 10 years old - has been another key talking point for observers.. State media photographs showed her taking centre stage at a pre-parade banquet with military leaders, where she was seated in the centre between Mr Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju, a spot usually given to her father.. The trio were pictured smiling and flanked by top military commanders. Ms Ri was also seen wearing a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a Hwasong-17 ICBM, North Korea's largest missile which was test-launched last year.. While some analysts say this points to Ju-ae as Mr Kim's heir apparent, others say the state may be portraying the North Korean leader as a \"family man\".. \"The inclusion of Kim's daughter in the banquet was difficult to miss. North Korea's state propagandists are clearly try to portray Kim Jong-un as a family man, but the exclusion of his other reported daughter is curious,\" said Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at Stimson Center who focuses on North Korea.. Kim Jong-un reportedly has at least three children, including an elder son and a younger daughter. Ju-ae is believed to be his second child.. She only made her first appearance in public three months ago in November, when her father took her to the launch of a major ICBM launch.. While succession positioning may ultimately be the case, it is \"too early\" to arrive at the conclusion, Mr Williams told the BBC.. Mr Panda said Ju-ae's prominence in recent months could indicate that Kim expects his country's nuclear enterprise to become a multi-generational affair. . ",

Local rescuers expressed disappointment at the failure to send the specialist equipment they need to save lives.. \"The UN aid... is the regular and periodic assistance that has been occurring since before the earthquake,\" . , an organisation whose volunteer first responders operate in the region.. \"It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble.\". , as well as basic relief items and solar lamps, to cover the needs of at least 5,000 people.. \"We are working very closely with authorities to support in any way we can and hope that aid will quickly reach those most impacted,\" said its director general, António Vitorino. . UN Secretary General António Guterres said: \"More help is on the way, but much more is needed.\". The White Helmets have reported at least 1,970 deaths since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in the early hours of Monday. . They have warned that the figure is likely to rise significantly because hundreds of families are still trapped beneath 418 destroyed and more than 1,300 partially destroyed buildings.. This video can not be played. Watch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horror. On Thursday morning, as the window to find survivors narrowed, the White Helmets said the lack of heavy machinery was significantly hampering their work and appealed to the international community for help.. Harsh winter weather conditions have also complicated the operation, while major power outages have resulted in fuel shortages at hospitals overwhelmed by the 2,950 injured survivors.. \"The situation is very bad. And there is no aid,\" Ibrahim Khalil Menkaween told Reuters news agency in the town of Jindayris.. The 56-year-old, who lost seven members of his family including his wife, was waiting next to the remains of his home with a body bag to give to rescuers. . \"I'm holding this bag for when they bring out my brother, and my brother's young son, and both of their wives,\" he explained.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive in the opposition-held north-west, which is controlled by a jihadist alliance and Turkish-backed rebel factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.. Last year, about 600 lorries carrying aid crossed from Turkey each month via Bab al-Hawa, the only border crossing that the UN is authorised to use. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of so-called \"cross-line\" aid.. The UN special envoy for Syria said on Thursday that earthquake-affected regions of the country had received \"nowhere near enough\" lifesaving aid and warned that assistance must not be \"politicised\".. \"We need it urgently through the fastest, most direct and most effective routes. They need more of absolutely everything,\" Geir Pedersen told reporters in Geneva.. He was speaking after a meeting of the UN's humanitarian task force for Syria, which includes Russia and Iran, whose forces have backed the Syrian government in the country's 12-year civil war, as well as Turkey, the United States and the European Union, which support the opposition.. The UN top aid official in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih, has said the country is experiencing a \"crisis on top of a crisis\", with 10.9 million people affected by earthquake nationwide.. Aid from countries including Iran, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Egypt, India and Venezuela has already reached government-controlled areas, where the health ministry says at least 1,260 people have been killed. . The government has suggested that lifting US and EU economic sanctions would help to speed up its emergency response. However, the EU has said the sanctions do not prohibit the export of food, medicines or medical equipment.. ",

        "content": "Along with lyricist Hal David, he also wrote numerous movie themes including What's New Pussycat?, Alfie and The Look Of Love - a major hit for Dusty Springfield.. Another collaborator, Dionne Warwick, said the songwriter's death was like \"losing a family member\".. Bacharach died on Wednesday at home in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Tina Brausam said.. Known for his airborne melodies and sumptuous orchestral arrangements, Bacharach was one of the most important songwriters of the 20th Century.. Over his career, he scored 50 chart hits in the US and UK, working with artists including Warwick, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Barbra Streisand, Tom Jones, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello.. Bacharach won three Oscars, two Golden Globes and six competitive Grammy Awards, and was hailed as music's \"greatest living composer\" when he accepted the Grammy lifetime achievement honour in 2008.. In her tribute, Warwick said: \"These words I've been asked to write are being written with sadness over the loss of my Dear Friend and my Musical Partner.. \"On the lighter side we laughed a lot and had our run-ins but always found a way to let each other know our family like roots were the most important part of our relationship.\". Other music stars shared their thoughts about Bacharach. .  said he was \"a hero of mine and very influential on my work\", adding: \"He was a giant in the music business. His songs will live forever,\" he added.. Former Oasis star . : \"RIP Maestro. It was a pleasure to have known you.\" . Oscar-winning songwriter Diane Warren said the field had \"lost its Beethoven\", while film and TV composer David Arnold agreed he was \"one of the greatest songwriters of all time\".. The Kinks guitarist .  Bacharach was \"probably one of the most influential songwriters of our time\" and \"a great inspiration\".. Charlatans frontman .  Bacharach left \"one of the greatest songwriting legacies in the history of ever\", adding: \"Farewell Burt Bacharach, you were a king.\". Bacharach's music touched multiple genres, from cool jazz and rhythm and blues, to bossa nova and traditional pop - but they shared one thing in common: you could recognise them within a couple of notes.. It was a style inspired by his tutor, French jazz musician Darius Milhaud. . \"His observation was: Never be ashamed of something that's melodic, one could whistle,\" Bacharach recalled. \"That was a valuable lesson I learned from him. Never forgot that one. Never be afraid of something that you can whistle.\". Born in Missouri, Bacharach grew up in New York City, where he first studied cello, drums and piano as a child. . Enraptured by jazz and be-bop, he would often sneak out to watch sets by his heroes Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and began playing in jazz bands of his own in the 1940s.. After graduating from school, he studied music theory and composition. Even when his education was interrupted by a spell in the military, he toured army bases as a uniformed concert pianist.. After returning home, he toured with Marlene Dietrich, becoming her personal conductor - but said his early success was all down to luck.. \"I wasn't chasing it. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was caught in the drift of things,\" he later reflected. \"I'm not a person who will walk over people, kill people, step on people to get to the next place where they want to be. Things just happened for me. I was very fortunate.\". In the 1950s, he was hired to work in New York's Brill Building, an epicentre of the music industry, and started writing country-rock smashes like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Only Love Can Break A Heart for Gene Pitney.. He scored his first UK number one in 1957 with Michael Holliday's sweet-but-charming The Story of My Life - a song that was originally recorded by Marty Robbins in the US.. That song also happened to be his first collaboration with Hal David, with whom he forged one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the '60s.. Their sophisticated, debonair pop was often at odds with the more raucous sounds of rock 'n' roll, but the hits kept coming - especially when they teamed up with Dionne Warwick. . Over a period of 10 years, the trio enjoyed 39 consecutive US hits, including such memorable songs as Walk On By, Don't Make Me Over, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and Promises, Promises.. Warwick later sued Bacharach after he and David stopped working together, leaving her without new material to record. . It was a \"very costly and unfortunate\" dispute, Bacharach told the Guardian in 2019, adding: \"I stupidly handled it wrong.\". He and Warwick reconciled for the 1985 charity single That's What Friends Are For, which raised $1.5m for the American Foundation for Aids Research (AmFar) - and also featured vocals from Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight.. Outside of that partnership, Bacharach and David won a Grammy and an Oscar in 1969 for Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, performed by BJ Thomas and featured in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.. Bacharach's music for the film also won the Oscar for best original score.. Although his hits tailed off in later years, Bacharach remained a popular figure, collaborating with Adele, Sheryl Crow and Dr Dre, among others.. Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher was a huge admirer, and once admitted to lifting the chords for Half The World Away from Bacharach's This Guy's In Love With You.. \"It sounds exactly the same. I'm surprised he's not sued me yet.\". Bacharach made a memorable appearance in the second Austin Powers film, performing I'll Never Fall in Love Again on an open top bus with Elvis Costello.. In 2016, he also wrote the score for John Asher's indie drama Po, saying he identified with the story, which explores the impact of autism on children. . Bacharach's daughter Nikki had died of suicide in 2007, at the age of 40, after a lifelong struggle with Asperger's syndrome.   . The musician was married four times, to Paula Stewart in 1953, actress Angie Dickinson in 1958, his frequent musical collaborator Carole Bayer Sager in 1982, and finally Jane Hansen in 1993.. He is survived by Hansen and their children Oliver and Raleigh, as well as son Cristopher from his marriage to Bayer Sager.. ",
