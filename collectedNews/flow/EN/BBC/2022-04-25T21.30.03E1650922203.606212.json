The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.. Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Mr Musk said . . . \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\" he added. . \"Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\". Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had full assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was \"the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders\".. Under the deal, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. . Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business. . Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted . Twitter responded by putting in place a so-called \"poison pill\" defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company.. Mr Musk has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will put in $21bn of his own money. . How many miles do you need to drive before it pays off?.

        "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked the court to hold Mr Trump in contempt after he missed a March deadline to present certain documents. . Mr Trump's lawyer said she would appeal the ruling. . \"Everything that your honour and the attorney general said that we haven't done - we have done,\" attorney Alina Habba said in court. . After a \"very diligent\" search, there were simply no more relevant documents to provide, she said. . Ms James, a Democrat, opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump, a Republican, had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans.. The stakes have been raised in this year's long legal wrangle between Donald Trump and New York's dogged state attorney general. . Letitia James has accused the former president of stonewalling - and now she's successfully made it that much more costly for him not to comply with her requests. . $10,000 a day adds up quickly, and if that isn't enough to convince him to provide the requested materials, the judge could yet increase the fines further. . That's not out of the realm of possibility given the judge's remark that - while Donald Trump takes his business seriously - so does the judge. . Mr Trump and his family have denied wrongdoing, and the former president has called the inquiry a \"witch hunt\". In court on Monday, Ms Habba called the civil probe as a \"fishing expedition\". . Justice Engoron said a contempt finding was warranted because of what he called \"repeated failures\" to hand over the requested materials.. \"Mr Trump... I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt,\" he said, although the former president was not in the courtroom.. The attorney general's office called the ruling a \"major victory\" in the legal battle against Mr Trump. . \"Today, justice prevailed,\" said Ms James. \"For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company's financial dealings. Today's ruling makes clear: no one is above the law.\". The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices..

        "content": "He also announced the US would allocate an extra $713m (£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations.. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of attempting to \"split Russian society and destroy Russia from within\". . Mr Austin, a retired four-star general, was speaking after meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. . The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. . At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".. The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with \"the right equipment\" and the \"right support\". . BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. . Mr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to \"destroy Russia\", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments.. US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (£260m) would be allocated to Ukraine. . It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (£2.9bn). . Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles.. Last week the US confirmed it had supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. . Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. . Mr Blinken announced some US diplomatic staff would start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv initially, with a longer-term plan to re-open the US Embassy in the capital, Kyiv. . President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. . Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration had assembled had put pressure on President Putin's government.. \"The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,\" Mr Blinken said. \"And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding.\". \"A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,\" Mr Blinken added. . Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated \"the unprecedented assistance\" from Washington and added that he \"would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine\". . President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. . But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US defence secretary. . America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. . More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. . Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. . To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China.  . For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. . In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. . On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow had made minor advances in the region but had \"yet to achieve a breakthrough\" because of logistical issues. . The update said: \"Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.\" .
