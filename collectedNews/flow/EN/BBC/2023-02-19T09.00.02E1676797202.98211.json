        "content": "\"I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,\" he said.. But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to \"crush\" the nation.. The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.. \"I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,\" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.. \"Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.\" . Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.. But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.. The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to \"bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace\".. He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, describing similar efforts around the world as a \"total failure\".. Despite Mr Macron's comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine's leaders.. On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.. Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the \"terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics\", he said.. President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was \"no trust\" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also .  to strike a peace deal with Moscow.. Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.. Last June, he was .  for saying it was vital that Russia was not \"humiliated over its invasion\".. Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was \"humiliating itself\" - needed to be put in its place.. ",

        "content": "Her daughter is inside. Next to her are the bodies of five other members of their family.. It's another cold bright afternoon at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing between southern Turkey and opposition-held north-western Syria.. Syrian refugee families who have lost loved ones in the earthquake that struck southern Turkey last week are gathered there to help repatriate their bodies. . Around us the heavy smell of death hangs in the air.. Aysha, her husband Nouman, and their four-year-old granddaughter Elma, were the only survivors after the six-story block of flats they were living in collapsed.  . Aysha and Nouman lost two daughters, one son, and two granddaughters, and were still searching for their son-in-law.. The family fled the civil war in Syria eight years ago, hoping for a fresh start, and took refuge in the southern Turkish city of Antakya. The city is now in ruins, with more than half of its buildings damaged. . The name of each Syrian victim brought to Bab al-Hawa is written with a blue pen on the body bags, to ensure they can be identified once back home. . \"Take good care of each other. Shirin, my dear, take care of your brother and sister and my beloved grandchildren,\" says Aysha as she kisses her daughter's body through the white cloth. . Her fingers linger on the lorry as it begins to pull away, clearly not wanting to let go.. Her husband breaks into tears at the sight of the truck crossing the border.. \"Goodbye my dears... You will all go home... You will be together,\" Nouman says, waving a bandaged hand. . That morning, five more lorries arrive at the border carrying the bodies of Syrians recovered from under the rubble. Some are just wrapped in blankets, rather than body bags.. Among the wreckage of the the Moarri family's flat back in Antakya, two glass pomegranates sit perfectly intact on a shelf. A painting still hangs above the table. The rest of the room has collapsed. . Wearing a high-visibility vest, Ali, who was engaged to Aysha's middle daughter, Viam, carries on searching through the rubble.. He shows us where he found Viam's body. They had been in love for four years but it was only a week before the earthquake that he had persuaded her father to accept their engagement. . \"That night we were still texting each other on WhatsApp until late. We weren't able to sleep,\" he says.. At around 04:00 he received a text message from Viam: \"Are you awake? I had a weird nightmare,\" she wrote.. They were in the middle of a video call when the earth started to shake. . \"I had just been telling her that she shouldn't think about that bad dream. And then we told each other we loved each other. She was sitting on her bed and laughing quietly,\" Ali recalls, trying hard to not break into tears.. \"I saw her trying to run, but her phone was plugged into the wall and it slowed her down. Then the picture froze. The screen went black.\" . A fitness trainer who has combat training experience with the armed opposition in Syria, Ali was able to protect himself by crawling under the table in his room. . \"When the earthquake finished, I ran out. Our whole neighbourhood was devastated. . \"I can't remember how I walked to the street where she [Viam] was living. It took me twice as long as all the roads were blocked.\". When he got to the block of flats, a makeshift rescue operation organised by neighbours was already under way. He called friends to join them. Hours went by and no official aid came. . Ali says he and his friends are from areas of Syria that have been frequently bombed by Syrian government forces during the war, so they have had some training and experience in search and rescue already. Syrians have to help Syrians, he adds.  . Part of the large area of north-western Syria affected by the earthquake is under the control of the Syrian government. Another part - where the Moarri family is from - is held by armed groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. . The co-ordination of the rescue and aid operations has therefore been highly complex, involving multiple parties to the conflict, the countries supporting them and international humanitarian organisations.. Ali feels resentful towards the international community, saying powerful countries are playing out larger conflicts in Syria and that the Syrian people are suffering as a result. . \"All the world came to help Turkey, and thank God that Turkey is a strong country itself. But how about Syria?\" . \"I don't want to talk about politics but from a humanitarian point of view, we don't have electricity, or clean water, not even homes.\" . He added: \"Our houses have been devastated by the war, and now the earthquake. Of course, we accept what comes from God. But I should tell the world: enough.\". After eight days of searching, Ali found the body of his beloved Viam. She was hugging her brother Mohammed when she died. . Now, with a group of 15 fellow Syrians, Ali is working to find other Syrian families. . Fine concrete dust covers them. It is everywhere here - making our eyes gritty, and our hair grey.. During the first 10 days after the earthquake more than 2,306 bodies were sent over the border into Syria, according to Turkish authorities. . Turkish border police tell us that it has been a massive operation for them, and a challenging one to co-ordinate. Sometimes they are ready to send the bodies, but the other side is not ready to receive them. Sometimes, it is the opposite.. As we prepare to leave, we see a man cuddling the body of his three-week-old baby wrapped in a small blanket. He is asking for help to take her body back to their home in an opposition-held part of Idlib province. . He had dug his daughter out of the rubble, then brought her across the border to Turkey for medical treatment. But she did not survive. . The Moarri family finally recovered the last person they were looking for - the body of their son-in-law - 10 days after the earthquake.  . I ask Ali why the Syrian refugees are sending their family's bodies to Syria. . \"It is our home. It is where we still hope and believe that one day we will go back to. We want our loved ones to wait for us there.\". ",

        "content": "Mr Carter, 98, has suffered from recent health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.. The country's oldest living leader, he served one term in office from 1977-81.. During his tenure as president Mr Carter faced a spate of foreign policy challenges and the Democrat was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan. . \"He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,\" the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday.. Terminally ill patients may seek hospice care instead of going through further medical treatment. The priority is not to provide further treatment, but to provide comfort towards the end of a patient's life. . Mr Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator, tweeted that he visited \"both of my grandparents yesterday.\". \"They are at peace and - as always - their home is full of love. Thank you all for your kind words,\" he said. . In 2021, Mr Carter and his wife Roslyn celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They have four children together.. Born in Georgia in 1924, Mr Carter entered politics in the 1960s when he was elected as state senator, before becoming the state's governor in 1971.. Five years later he defeated the sitting Republican President Gerald Ford to become the 39th commander-in-chief. . But problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter as president. . At home, an oil crisis produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures.. The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treaty returning control of the Panama Canal to Panama.. But in 1979 the last Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in the aftermath. Mr Carter cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in response and introduced a trade embargo.. However, the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped as the US hostages were held for 444 days. His approval ratings took a further hit after an attempt to rescue the hostages failed and eight US military members were killed.. Iran then delayed the release of the hostages until after Ronald Reagan was sworn in.. Since leaving the White House, Mr Carter has remained active, carrying out humanitarian work with his Carter Center.. He led a delegation that sought to persuade military leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there.. He went on to gain an international reputation for his work in promoting human rights, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.. With Nelson Mandela, he founded The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights. . He also travelled extensively - well into his early 90s - and took part in annual trips to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity charity. . But the former president has also battled a host of health issues in recent years. In August 2015, Mr Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. . The following year he announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. . He has frequently expressed a striking calmness when dealing with his health challenges. . \"I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,\" he said in 2015. \"I've had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.\". Mr Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife were born between the First World War and the Great Depression, and where they returned when he left office. . A host of senior US politicians - including Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock - offered their thoughts and prayers to Mr Carter's family as news broke on Saturday night. . \"In this tender time of transitioning, God is surely walking with him,\" Senator Warnock tweeted. \"May he, Rosalynn & the entire Carter family be comforted with that peace and surrounded by our love & prayers.\".

        "content": "But now an investigation .  has revealed more details.. According to the investigation, M'Barki ran reports on a variety of subjects - luxury yachts in Monaco, a Sudanese opposition leader, allegations of corruption in Qatar - that had all one thing in common: they were planted by an Israel-based outfit specialising in 'news for hire'.. M'Barki has denied being paid to run the stories, but he admits to bypassing BFM's editorial checks.  . He says he was offered the reports by an intermediary and exercised his own professional judgment in selecting to use them.. But the investigators say they have evidence that the origin of the stories lies in the shadowy Team Jorge, an operation based in Tel Aviv and run by a former Israeli special forces officer whose real name is Tal Hanan.. According to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories, Team Jorge is one of several players in a growing world of disinformation mercenaries - private sector experts in intelligence who for a price will use the internet to damage an enemy's reputation or influence an election.. To get access to Team Jorge, three journalists from the Forbidden Stories consortium posed as potential clients seeking to shape opinion in French-speaking Africa on behalf of a major multinational. . After a lengthy negotiation, they finally arranged a face-to-face meeting and got what amounted to a sales pitch.. Hanan claimed to have intervened in more than 30 elections and to have access to email and social media accounts of prominent African figures.. Central to the Team Jorge offer was a platform called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (AIMS), which generates tens of thousands of fake identities with accounts on Facebook and Telegram. These accounts then spread the content of a campaign.. The investigators identified around 20 different international campaigns which they believed Team Jorge had organised. . Among the material being circulated on social media, they especially noticed two television news reports in French that purportedly ran on BFM.. After checking with BFM's management, they had confirmation: the reports were shown late at night on the channel, but without the knowledge of the editorial team. . At that point, on January 11, M'Barki was called in and suspended.. The first of the reports was on the EU's Russia sanctions, and their impact on the luxury yacht business in Monaco. . It was claimed that 10,000 jobs were at risk and that the industry had appealed to Prince Albert to intervene on their behalf. None of that has been proved.. The second report, broadcast in mid-December, was about a leafleting campaign in Paris accusing a former state prosecutor in Qatar of corruption.. When originally shown in the early hours of the morning, the reports would have gone almost unobserved.  . But that changed when they were picked up by social media and Team Jorge's massed avatars. Suddenly they were viral.. By seemingly planting the reports onto mainstream French television, the organisers would have immeasurably boosted the credibility of what would otherwise have been unsubstantiated gossip.  . It also would mean Team Jorge had evidence for future clients of its access to western media.. M'Barki's late night show also ran items on a Sudanese general who was considering running for the presidency, and a trade show in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. . In this second piece, the name of the territory was replaced by the politically-charged term Moroccan Sahara.. The area has been the subject of .  between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.. The people or organisations that ultimately commissioned the suspected campaigns remain a mystery, according to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories.  . Some may have been commissioned by governments, but most - like the yacht story - were probably ordered by private interests, the investigation concluded.. A worrying sign, the investigators say, of the growing \"Uberisation\" of the fake news business.. ",
