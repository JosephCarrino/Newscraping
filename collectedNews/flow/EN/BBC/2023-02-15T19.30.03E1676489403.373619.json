        "content": "He had been enrolled in a football academy in the UK since late last year.. He was captain of the Thai boys' football team, which was trapped deep inside a cave for over two weeks while exploring in Chiang Rai province. . His grinning face, caught by the torch light of a diver after the boys were found in the cave, was one of the most memorable images from the rescue. . It is not known how the teenager died, but Leicestershire Police said his death is not being treated as suspicious. Reports in Thailand said he suffered a head injury.. Promthep was driven by ambulance to Kettering General Hospital on Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson for East Midlands Ambulance Service said. An air ambulance was also sent to the scene.. In August last year, his team mates rejoiced when Promthep, who they call Dom, announced on Instagram that he had won a scholarship to join the Brooke House College Football Academy in Market Harborough. . \"Today my dream has come true,\" he wrote. . Just six months on, they are mourning the loss of their friend. . News of his death emerged after his mother informed the Wat Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai, which the team frequented. . \"May Dom's soul rest in peace,\" said the post, which was accompanied by pictures of the football team with monks.. Soon, messages began pouring in from his team mates. . \"You told me to wait and see you play for the national team, I always believe that you would do it,\" wrote Prachak Sutham, one of the boys who was rescued with Promthep in 2018.. \"When we met the last time before you left for England, I even jokingly told you that when you come back, I would have to ask for your autograph. . \"Sleep well, my dear friend. We will always have 13 of us together.\" . Another of the boys, Titan Chanin Viboonrungruang, wrote: \"Brother, you told me that we would be achieving our football dream... if the next world is real, I want us to play football together again, my brother Dom.\". Principal of Brooke House College, Ian Smith, said they were \"deeply saddened and shaken\" by the death.. \"We unite in grief with all of Dom's family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college's global family,\" he said.. In a . , British Ambassador to Thailand Mark Gooding passed on \"his condolences to all his friends and family.\". Promthep studied in Vachiralai Bee School in Chiang Mai before he went to the UK. A diehard football fan, he had been a member of a youth team in Chiang Mai.. His Instagram account is filled with posts on the sport, often accompanied with the hashtag #footballismylife. . One of his last posts in January shows a sketch of his \"dream team's football kit\" - jersey, shorts, socks and shoes with blue and pink stripes. . After football practice on 23 June 2018, the Wild Boars (Moo Pa in Thai) football team - of which Promthep was captain - raced to the Tham Luang cave on their bicycles. It was one of the team's favourite haunts.. But a sudden storm caused the narrow passageways in the cave system to flood, trapping the boys and their coach inside. . They spent nine days in darkness and without food - while a desperate search effort involving some 10,000 people went on - before they were found by divers. . Promthep turned 13 while he was trapped in the cave. His teammates were aged between 11 and 16 at the time, while their coach Ekkaphon Kanthawong was 25.. The boys used rocks to dig holes to escape, while their coach taught them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible. . Divers sent them food and letters from their family even as they planned the rescue. They were eventually brought out after being sedated with the drug ketamine.. The rescue made headlines around the world, and various films and books were later made to retell the extraordinary story, including a six-episode miniseries that Netflix released last year..

        "content": "She was also barred from activities as a journalist for five years.. Hundreds of civilians died when the Mariupol theatre was bombed last March.. Ponomarenko was detained last April, weeks after the bombing, for posting that Russian warplanes had carried out the attack even though the Russian defence ministry had denied it.. She is one of a growing number of Russian dissidents jailed for criticising the war in Ukraine.. Some 1,200 civilians were seeking shelter inside the theatre when it was bombed by Russian fighter jets. Ukrainian authorities believe 300 people were killed but an Associated Press investigation said the number was closer to 600. Many of the bodies were found in the basement.. Amnesty International said it was a war crime carried out by Russian forces and the international monitoring group .  that a Ukrainian battalion had blown up the theatre.. Prosecutors said Maria Ponomarenko had committed a criminal offence brought in within days of the invasion of spreading \"knowingly false information\" about the Russian armed forces.. Addressing the court ahead of her sentence she stressed that under Russia's constitution she had done nothing wrong: \"Had I committed a real crime then it would be possible to ask for leniency, but again, due to my moral and ethical qualities, I would not do this.\". Declaring herself a patriotic, opposition pacifist, she ended her address by saying: \"No totalitarian regime has ever been as strong as before its collapse.\". The journalist and activist, who has two young children, has suffered mental health problems in jail, according to her lawyer, and last year compared her conditions in pre-trial detention to torture.. Last summer, Moscow councillor Alexei Gorinov was jailed for seven years after he was filmed speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine in a city council meeting. Earlier this week a UN working group called for his release, concluding that his detention was arbitrary and contravened the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.. In December one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years for spreading \"fake news\" about the military after he went on YouTube to condemn the killing of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians by Russian occupying forces in Bucha, near Kyiv. .

Millions of people across Syria and Turkey are living in makeshift camps and require humanitarian aid. . Video of the rescue posted to social media by the Mayor of Darica, Muzaffer Biyik, showed workers applauding and embracing one another as Ms Kekec was loaded into the ambulance.. Local media reported that when they found the 42-year-old survivor, Ms Imamoglu, they told her she was \"awesome\".. In Antakya- another Turkish city badly affected by the earthquakes - local media reported that a mother and her two children were pulled alive from the rubble.. Ten days on from the disaster, it is becoming harder to find quake survivors. The combined death toll has now passed 41,000.. Foreign rescue workers who arrived in Turkey shortly after the quakes are beginning to pack up and return home, while locals are shifting their focus to cleaning up the debris.. Survivors must now begin to rebuild their lives. The Turkish government has encouraged people to return to their homes if possible, after authorities have declared they are safe. . But many have lost their homes and are living in makeshift camps. In Kahramanmaras, where the women were rescued, more than 1,000 survivors camped in a local stadium. . In Syria, relief efforts have been hampered by the civil war that has divided the country.. The UN did not provide aid to Syria for days, saying logistical issues were to blame.. When aid did arrive following the opening of a second border crossing through Turkey, rescuers said they did not supply any of the heavy machinery required to remove rubble. . \"It has never happened before, that there was an earthquake somewhere and the international community and the UN don't help,\" said Raed Saleh, who is leading the White Rebels rescue force in opposition-held areas..

        "content": "The other 28 defendants were also acquitted - among them Moroccan dancer Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, who figured in an earlier Berlusconi case.. Berlusconi has faced many court cases.. In the Ruby case, the right-wing senator won an appeal against his conviction for paying for sex with an underage prostitute. Ruby and he both denied having had sex and she denied having ever been a prostitute.. In his various court cases, he has denied wrongdoing, accusing prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him. He insisted the parties - described by some as \"orgies\" - were actually elegant dinners.. The only Berlusconi trial that ended in a conviction was his sentencing for tax fraud in 2013. Given his age, Italian justice treated him leniently - he did a year of community service at a care home near Milan.. Berlusconi was prime minister three times between 1994 and 2011. He was accused of giving witnesses millions of euros in hush money in the \"bunga-bunga\" trial, but said the money was given as compensation for reputational damage to people linked to the notorious parties.. He was temporarily barred from political office over his conviction for tax fraud, but won a seat in the Senate in 2022 elections.. His Forza Italia party plays a key role in Italy's ruling right-wing coalition, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. She hailed his acquittal as \"excellent news that puts an end to a long legal case that also had important repercussions on Italian political and institutional life\".. As Italian leader, Berlusconi forged a close friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And this week, Berlusconi made controversial comments about the war in Ukraine which were condemned by Kyiv.. On Sunday, Berlusconi said he would \"never\" have met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, as Ms Meloni did last Thursday in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU summit.. Berlusconi said that if President Zelensky had stopped attacking the two Russian-backed regions of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, the war would not have happened. \"So I judge very, very negatively the behaviour of this gentleman,\" he said.. Ms Meloni reaffirmed Italian support for Mr Zelensky after Berlusconi's remarks. And Zelensky aide Mykhailo Podolyak denounced Berlusconi as \"a VIP agitator who is acting in the interests of Russian propaganda\". \"He is bartering away Italy's reputation for his friendship with Putin,\" he said..
