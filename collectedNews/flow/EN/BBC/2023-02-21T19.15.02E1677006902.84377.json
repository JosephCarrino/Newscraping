        "content": "Iran accused him of being the leader of a pro-monarchist terrorist group. . He denied the claim and a human rights group said he faced a grossly unfair trial based on forced \"confessions\".. Germany's Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, condemned the sentence as \"absolutely unacceptable\".. \"We call on Iran to remedy these shortcomings in the appeals process, correct the verdict accordingly and refrain from the death penalty,\" a statment said.. \"Imposing the death penalty on Mr Sharmahd will provoke a strong reaction.\". , a former deputy Iranian defence minister who was convicted of spying for the UK.. The Iranian judiciary's Mizan news agency reported that a Revolutionary Court in Tehran had found Jamshid Sharmahd guilty of \"spreading corruption on Earth through planning and leading terror operations\".. It alleged that he was the leader of a terrorist group known as Tondar and that he had \"planned 23 terror attacks\", of which \"five were successful\", including the 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in that killed 14 people.. Tondar - which means \"thunder\" in Persian - is another name of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran (KAI), a little-known US-based opposition group that seeks to restore the monarchy overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. . , Sharmahd created a website to publish statements from the KAI, including claims of explosions inside Iran. He also read out statements in radio and video broadcasts. . However, he denied his involvement in the attacks attributed to him by Iranian authorities, saying he was only a spokesman, and rejected all accusations during his trial, which began earlier this month.. Amnesty International said Sharmahd alleged in two telephone calls with his family last year that he had been tortured and subjected to other ill-treatment in detention, including by being held in prolonged solitary confinement. . He also said he had been denied adequate healthcare, with access to medications required for his Parkinson's disease delayed routinely.. In August 2020, Iran's intelligence ministry announced that it had arrested Sharmahd following a \"complex operation\", without providing any details.. The previous month, Sharmahd had arrived in the United Arab Emirates on a flight from Germany. He was staying at a hotel in Dubai, awaiting a connecting flight to India, when his family lost contact. . They were able to track his mobile phone's location, however, and noticed that it had crossed the border with Oman, despite it being closed for travel because of coronavirus-related restrictions, . . . The source said the family had received a message from Sharmahd's phone saying that he was well a day before Iran had published a video in which he appeared blindfolded and confessed to various crimes. . The UN working group said the UAE did not contest the claim that Sharmahd was kidnapped and transferred to Oman by Iranian agents. Oman meanwhile concluded that he infiltrated the country with the help of a group of facilitators and illegally left for Iran by sea \"of his own free will\".. In 2019, dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam was reportedly abducted by Revolutionary Guards during a visit to Iraq and forcibly returned to Iran. . .. ",

        "content": "The men had held a wedding ceremony in 2019, but same-sex marriage is not recognised in South Korea.. Activists say the ruling is a leap forward for LGBT rights in the country.. However, the case will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  . The plaintiff, So Seong-wook said he welcomed the ruling and \"recognition of a very obvious right that has not been given\".. In 2021, he sued the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) after being denied coverage on his partner Kim Yongmin's plan.. The couple had been granted coverage at first, but this was then revoked as the NHIS said they had made a mistake in granting it to the same-sex couple.. Celebrating the ruling, Mr So praised the court for seeing \"the principle of equality as an important issue\".. \"I think it has a great meaning for LGBTQ people who have been in a discriminatory situation, those who support them and all those who are discriminated against,\" he told the BBC.. The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's verdict. It found spousal coverage under the NHIS extended to not just families as defined by law. . It also found that denying same-sex couples such benefits amounted to discrimination.. \"Everyone can be a minority in some way. To be in the minority is to be different from the majority and cannot be wrong itself,\" the court judgement read.. \"In a society dominated by the principle of majority rule, awareness of the rights of minorities and efforts to protect them are necessary.\". A Human Rights Watch report last year found that discrimination against LGBT people in South Korean society remained \"pervasive\". . Same-sex couples  - without the legal status of marriage - are often excluded from government benefits for newlyweds.. After Tuesday's court ruling, Amnesty International released a statement saying: \"There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTI community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome.\".

        "content": "\"Russia suspends its participation in the New Start treaty,\" announced the Kremlin leader in his state of the nation address. As usual he blamed the West.. New Start is the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America. It limits the nuclear arsenals of the two countries. . But there was more. . The Russian president announced that he had signed a decree on \"putting new ground-based strategic complexes on combat standby duty\". . He warned that Russia was ready to resume nuclear weapons testing.. \"Of course, we will not do it first,\" President Putin added. \"But if the US conducts tests, we will do it as well.\". New Start had been in trouble. Last month Washington had accused Moscow of violating the agreement by refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory. . Moscow's suspension of its participation in the treaty raises the stakes.. \"This is more about nuclear blackmail, but it is extremely dangerous,\" believes Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \"because we cannot predict how Putin will behave in the future and what is in his mind.. \"In order to avoid nuclear war, it's better to have a framework,\" he added.. \"By losing this framework we are witnessing the real threat of a nuclear war.\". Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.. The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.. Each side's limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.. Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world's nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.. We're also witnessing a Kremlin leader who expresses no remorse or regret for his decision to invade Ukraine. . His \"special military operation\" has not gone at all according to plan, bringing misery to Ukraine, heavy military casualties for Russia and forcing President Putin to draft hundreds of thousands of Russians into the army. . So, was the invasion a huge mistake? A giant miscalculation? You won't hear Putin admit to one of those. He continues to push the false narrative that the West is to blame for the war.. \"I want to repeat,\" he said. \"They [the West] started the war. And we used force and are using force to stop it.\". \"The Western elites do not conceal their goals to bring Russia a strategic defeat. What does it mean? It means to end us, once and for all. . It means they plan to turn a local conflict into a global confrontation. We understand it exactly like that. We will react to it accordingly. This is because in this case it is about the very existence of our country.\" . President Putin exuded confidence that Russia could survive international sanctions and - despite Western support for Ukraine - emerge victorious. No hint of compromise. No sign he's looking for an off-ramp.. \"He thinks he has reserves for continuing the war and confrontation. It's a bad sign,\" Mr Kolesnikov concludes.\" He has disrupted any connection with Western countries. He is not ready to finish this disaster right now. He will continue.\". ",

A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and dozens of subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit.. Ali Mazlum, 18, told AFP news agency he had been looking for the bodies of family members from the previous earthquakes when the latest tremors hit. . \"You don't know what to do... we grabbed each other and right in front of us, the walls started to fall,\" he said. . In a visit to the southern province of Osmaniye, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised to hold to account anyone responsible for shoddy construction that led to deaths in the initial earthquake a fortnight ago. . \"It is our duty to hold the wrongdoers accountable before the law,\" he said. . Shortly after the earthquake, . , a move that some saw as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . In the city of Adana, the latest earthquake drove people to a volleyball centre that had been converted into a rescue centre following the first earthquake.. The authorities have told the BBC they believe as many as 600 people may have arrived overnight - seeking a sturdy, ground-level building in which to take shelter.. When the quake struck, people were reported to have run out into the streets rather than staying put, reflecting the fact that there is still significant fear two weeks after the initial disaster. . In Syria, some 470 injured people are said to have visited hospitals after Monday's quakes, which were also reportedly felt in Egypt and Lebanon. . In a visit to Turkey on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid, saying that America would help with earthquake recovery \"for as long as it takes\".. It is one of several countries to have offered their help in the wake of the first earthquake. . Rescue operations have .  in all but two areas, with hopes of finding people alive fading fast. .
