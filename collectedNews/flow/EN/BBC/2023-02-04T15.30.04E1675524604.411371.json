        "content": "Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier called off a visit to Beijing, saying the \"surveillance\" balloon's presence was \"an irresponsible act\".. Later the US reported a second Chinese balloon floating over Latin America.. China expressed regret over the balloon over the US, saying it was a weather airship that had been blown astray. It was last spotted over Missouri.. It is expected to reach America's east coast near the Carolinas this weekend.. The US has decided not to shoot down the high-altitude airship due to the danger of falling debris.. The incident comes amid fraying tensions between the US and China.. In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing \"never violated the territory and airspace of any sovereign country\".. It said its senior foreign policy official Wang Yi had discussed the incident with Mr Blinken over the phone, stressing that maintaining communication channels at all levels was important, \"especially in dealing with some unexpected situations in a calm and reliable manner\". . It added that Beijing \"would not accept any groundless conjecture or hype\" and accused \"some politicians and media in the United States\" of using the incident \"as a pretext to attack and smear China.\". According to US officials, the airship floated over Alaska and Canada before appearing over the US state of Montana, which is home to a number of sensitive nuclear missile sites.. The incident angered top US officials, with Mr Blinken saying he had told Beijing the balloon's presence was \"a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law\" and \"an irresponsible act\". He called it \"unacceptable\" and \"even more irresponsible coming on the eve of a long-planned visit\".. America's top diplomat had been set to visit Beijing from 5 to 6 February to hold talks on a wide range of issues, including security, Taiwan and Covid-19. It would have been the first high-level US-China meeting there in years.. But on Thursday, US defence officials announced they were tracking a giant surveillance balloon over the US.. This video can not be played. Watch: 'At first I thought it was a star'. While the balloon was, the Pentagon said, \"travelling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic\" and did \"not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground\", its presence sparked outrage.. On Friday, China finally acknowledged the balloon was its property, saying that it was a civilian airship used for meteorological research, which deviated from its route because of bad weather.. And late on Friday, the Pentagon said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted - this time over Latin America.. \"We are seeing reports of a balloon transiting Latin America. We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,\" said Pentagon press secretary Brig Gen Patrick Ryder. . He provided no further details about its location, but there have been reported sightings over Costa Rica and Venezuela.. China has so far made no public comments on the reported second balloon.. ",

        "content": "\"I would not have missed coming to Juba for anything. We are here to get the Pope's blessings. I am confident that with his blessings things will change for this country,\" she told the BBC.. Driven by faith and a sense of patriotism, the women had set off from Rumbek - some 300km (190 miles) north-west of Juba.. Their mission: to join the Pope in prayer for the world's youngest nation, which has been beset by conflict since its independence in 2011 - a situation that has brought untold misery to millions of its people.. \"We walked for a couple of hours each day and then we would spend the night in the parishes at the centres where we were. It was tiring but worth it,\" said Faith Biel.. As they walked for the last few miles, dust and joyful songs filled the air as a caravan of people sang and stamped their feet.. The spectacle attracted crowds of onlookers. Some joined in as the dancing became more vigorous. Others, unsure, stood at a safe distance to make way for the group of women dressed in white and wearing headscarves with a print of Pope Francis's face.. Their besmirched clothes, blistered feet and cracked lips attested to the ordeal of the nine-day trek, but they still danced and jumped to celebrate their accomplishment. . Refreshments awaited them at Juba's St Theresa's Catholic Church, where a welcoming party had also started singing and dancing. . One pilgrim, who was shedding tears as she arrived, hinted at the trauma the years of fighting have brought to this country.. \"When you have smelled and seen death and hopelessness, then you will search for peace with all the might that you have,\" said the woman, who did not want to give her name. . \"I have lost enough, but along the way I saw love and we all spoke one language - that of peace. I really pray that even after the Pope leaves, we will still be like that,\" she continued.. \"He is a prophet and whatever he prays in the next few days, while on our soil, will come to pass. Things will be different. We are going to be one people.\". The church is seen as a symbol of hope for many in South Sudan. It is where many displaced by the country's conflicts seek refuge.. It has also continued to take a leading role in the social welfare of the people and given most of them a sense of belonging. . Pope Francis is spending three days in the country and will hold a Mass on Sunday.. In a historic first, he travelled with two other Christian leaders - Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland Rev Iain Greenshields.. In 2019 Pope Francis kissed the feet of South Sudan's bitter political rivals, President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, when they met at the Vatican. . This was an act that shocked many, even if it did not immediately end the fighting.. Although that conflict has now subsided, many local disputes still turn deadly on a regular basis - on the eve of the Pope's arrival, more than 20 people were killed in a cattle raid.. Millions of South Sudanese will be hoping - and praying - that the visit of the three religious leaders will mark a new beginning for this troubled country.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "The proposed $72bn (£60bn) buyout never materialised.. If found liable, Musk could have been ordered to pay out billions in damages.. It took the nine jurors less than two hours to reach their verdict on the class-action lawsuit on Friday afternoon. . Mr Musk - who had wanted the trial moved to Texas, where Tesla is based, arguing he could not get a fair trial in San Francisco - welcomed the outcome.. Taking to Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44bn last October, he posted: \"Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!. \"I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.\". Central to the lawsuit was Mr Musk's tweet on 7 August 2018: \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\". The plaintiffs also argued Mr Musk had lied when he tweeted later in the day that \"investor support is confirmed\".. The stock price surged after the tweets, but fell back again within days as it became clear the deal would not go through.. According to an economist hired by the shareholders, investor losses were calculated as high as $12bn, after many made decisions about buying and selling their shares based on the tweet.  . The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mr Musk over his tweets, accusing him of lying to investors. Mr Musk agreed to step aside as Tesla board chairman and settled for $20m.. During the three-week trial, Mr Musk - who also leads SpaceX and Twitter - had argued he thought he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund for the deal.. During his nearly nine hours on the witness stand, the world's second-richest man said: \"Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.\". Shareholders had argued that \"funding secured\" suggested more than a verbal agreement. . Although Tesla's share price shot up after the tweet was posted, Mr Musk also questioned whether his tweets had any effect on Tesla's share price. . \"At one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high... and it went higher, which is counterintuitive,\" he said - arguing the effect his tweets have on the stock price can be unpredictable. . Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan to take Tesla private after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded.. He was not in court when the verdict was read, but he was present during closing arguments earlier on Friday as duelling portraits were drawn of him by the rival legal teams.. Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders, said: \"Our society is based on rules. We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else.\". Mr Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said: \"Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud.\". After the verdict, Mr Porritt said: \"We are disappointed with the verdict and are considering next steps.\". Mr Musk was generally calm during his testimony - though at times he appeared annoyed at the line of questioning. . There were also times of levity. After a lawyer representing shareholders accidentally called Elon Musk \"Mr Tweet\", Elon Musk promptly changed his name on Twitter to the same moniker. . Several Tesla directors also testified, including James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. They testified that Mr Musk did not need the Tesla board to review buyout tweets. . Securities fraud lawyer Reed Kathrein called the tweet about taking Tesla private \"as concrete a statement of taking a company private as there can be\", and said the not guilty verdict was \"a travesty to investors and the securities laws\".  .

Mr Kishida said the remarks were \"outrageous\" and \"completely incompatible\" with his government's policies.. Japan - a country still largely bound by traditional gender roles and family values - is the only G7 nation that does not recognise same-sex marriage.. However, recent polling suggests most Japanese support gay marriage.. A number of same-sex couples have also filed lawsuits across Japan in recent years arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage violates the country's constitution.. Prior to Mr Arai's dismissal, Mr Kishida had talked about issues surrounding same-sex marriage in parliament.. He stated that it needed to be carefully considered because of its potential impact on traditional family structures.. Mr Arai reacted to the remarks afterwards, telling reporters that he \"wouldn't like it if [LGBT couples] lived next door\" and \"doesn't even want to look at them.\". He added that it would \"change the way society is\" and \"quite a few people would abandon this country,\" according to Kyodo News.. In response, Mr Kishida said he had dismissed Mr Arai, adding: \"We have been respecting diversity and realising an inclusive society.\". Mr Arai later apologised, stating that his remarks were not appropriate and were not representative of the prime minister's views.. His resignation represents a further blow to Mr Kishida, whose government has seen plummeting approval ratings after a number of his ministers have resigned over various scandals in recent months..
