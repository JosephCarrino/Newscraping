        "content": "The deal, signed in 2010, limits the number of US and Russian nuclear warheads and gives each the power to inspect the other's weapons. . Mr Biden's comments came as he met a key group of Nato allies in Poland. . The group of eastern European states, known as the Bucharest Nine, reiterated their condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year since its start. . Putin's decision to suspend involvement in the nuclear treaty was officially pushed through by both houses of Russia's parliament on Wednesday.. But Russia's foreign ministry later said Moscow would continue to comply with the New Start treaty's restrictions in a \"responsible approach\".. A senior military official told Russia's lower house that the country would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes.. Signed in 2010 by two then presidents - Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev - the New Start treaty was designed to prevent nuclear war. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both sides can deploy, and gives each country the power to inspect the other.. The arrangement came into force in 2011 and was extended 10 years later - although weapons inspections were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.. Each side's limit is 1,550 long-range nuclear warheads, a lower number than under the previous Start deal.. Between them, the two former Cold War rivals account for almost all of the world's nuclear weapons. Russia had previously said it wanted to keep the treaty running - despite hostile rhetoric on both sides during the Ukraine war.. Speaking ahead of the meeting with leaders from the Bucharest Nine nations - which make up Nato's eastern flank - Mr Biden said suspending New Start was a \"big mistake\" and reiterated the US commitment to the military alliance.. \"Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made. We will defend literally every inch of Nato,\" he said. Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any member state is treated as an attack on all and requires a joint response.. At the meeting he told the assembled leaders that they were the \"front line of our collective defence\". In a joint statement after the meeting the group said they were committed to increasing Nato's military presence on their territories.. Russia says Nato - which could soon see Sweden and Finland become new members - represents an existential threat.. Mr Putin, speaking at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of the war, said Russia was fighting in Ukraine for its \"historical\" lands.. \"I just heard from the top military leadership of the country that a battle is ongoing right now, for our historical lands, for our people,\" he said.. Earlier he met China's top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow and said cooperation with Beijing was \"very important to stabilise the international situation\". . Mr Wang said Beijing was ready to strengthen its partnership with Moscow and said their relationship would not be affected by pressure from other countries.. ",

French newspaper Sud Ouest said the attacker entered the classroom while the teacher was giving a Spanish class and attacked her. . The teacher was in her 50s and died of cardiac arrest after emergency services arrived at the school, local media reported.. French TV station BFM said the attacker locked the classroom door and stabbed the teacher in her chest.. Local prosecutor Jerome Bourrier said that an investigation had been opened by local police for assassination and the suspect was in custody. He added that the suspect was not known to the police or the justice system.. The prosecutor will give a news conference on Thursday afternoon to give further details about the investigation.. France's Education Minister Pap Ndiaye called the attack \"a tragedy of extreme gravity\" and expressed his condolences. . \"Today is a time of emotion and a time for solidarity,\" he said on a visit to the school. \"The whole nation is present here to express its sorrow and emotion.\". Local media reported the student might have been suffering from mental health issues. They said at this stage of the investigation there was no suggestion the incident was terror-related. . In a news conference, Mr VÃ©ran said the government would support educators across the country in the wake of the incident.. \"I can hardly imagine the trauma that this represents,\" he said. . The school is a private, Catholic establishment near the centre of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, a well known French summer holiday location.. By lunchtime, students who had been told to remain in their classrooms were able to leave the school and many were collected by their parents.. ",

        "content": "It comes after a suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and Canadian airspace before it was shot down by the US military. . China has also been recently accused of interfering with Canadian elections. . Monitoring buoys were discovered and retrieved last fall as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the country's security by surveilling air, land and sea domains.. A spokesperson for Canada's Department of National Defence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, said in a statement that the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches\". . Mr Le Bouthillier added that China does this using \"dual-purpose technologies\", meaning devices that conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes. . He said the military has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory since 2022, but did not elaborate on their nature.. China has long displayed interest in the Arctic. It has sent high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and participates in most major Arctic institutions. . It has also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north, often for research expeditions.. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate change, and gain access to emerging resources.. But experts say that China's research interests in the region have also doubled as attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.. Their efforts are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US, Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped potential in the region.. \"This is a part of the world that has not been mapped and understood to the same degree of detail as other latitudes,\" said Roberto Mazzolin, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a former high-ranking official in the Canadian Armed Forces. . Mr Mazzolin said Canada has historically looked at the Arctic as a safe area with little potential for threat. But interest in the region by Russia, and more recently China, has changed that.. \"[Canada is forced to] look at how we would posture our own security, our military defence, or our economic development activities to secure Canadian and American interests,\" he said. . On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that she views China as an increasingly disruptive power. . Ms Joly added that Canada is working closely with the US to protect North American airspace, as well as Canada's Arctic sovereignty.. The Canadian military's discovery of the Chinese buoys comes at the heels of revelations by Canadian intelligence that China had tried to interfere in Canada's last federal election in 2021. . In documents first reported on by the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service outlined China's efforts to re-elect Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority of government, and to ensure the defeat of Conservative politicians who are seen as unfriendly to China.. It did so through cash donations to preferred candidates, the spread of disinformation and using consulates and paid students to help certain Liberal candidates, according to reporting by the Globe. . Canadian parliamentarians are in the midst of probing allegations that China interfered in Canada's 2019 federal election. On Tuesday, they expanded their scope to include the 2021 election as well. . On Wednesday, Prime Minister Trudeau called the suspected Chinese election interference \"an extraordinarily serious issue\", and said he supported a further probe into these reports. . He added the meddling efforts so far appear to have been unsuccessful, but still raise concern that foreign countries are trying to interfere with Canada's democratic processes. . \"Foreign actors are trying to undermine people's confidence in democracy itself,\" Mr Trudeau said.. Chinese officials in Canada have denied these reports, saying they do not interfere in Canadian election or internal affairs. Earlier this month, China's suspected surveillance efforts in North America dominated headlines after a Chinese balloon was discovered flying over North America.. Both the US and Canada said that the balloon was spying on sensitive military assets. China, however, has denied it was used for surveillance, instead saying it was a civilian weather balloon that had blown off course.. ",

        "content": "There they were, sitting within handshake distance, with an oval-shaped table in the middle.. It could be that the proximity was achieved by seating placement at a previously used table, with the Chinese delegation directly across the middle rather than at the long ends but the effect was the same. . When the footage was released, it appeared to be a deliberately symbolic move to show that he felt safe enough to be that close to the representative of such an important friend.. Of course, it has not always been that way. Decades ago, Beijing's network of underground fallout shelters was designed to protect the citizens of the Chinese capital from a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.. Yet now Xi Jinping's administration sees Russia as a front-line enemy of US influence. A nation which - like North Korea - may be considered an international pariah but which serves a useful geopolitical purpose.. The Chinese government did not even seem that embarrassed when President Putin returned home from attending Beijing Winter Olympics, having proclaimed a new \"no limits\" relationship with China and, within weeks, launched the invasion of Ukraine.. Many have asked whether Mr Xi was warned about the imminent war when he sat next to his Russian counterpart who must have been considering barely anything else at the time.. China is walking along a very delicate path in its dealings with Russia over Ukraine. Mr Xi may feel like he is confidently striding down the track, but some think that the path is crumbling at the edges, with Beijing's claim to neutrality increasingly difficult to stand up.. Wang Yi comes out of meetings proclaiming that China and Russia are together promoting \"peace and stability\".. In other parts of the world, it will seem ludicrous to use expressions like \"peace and stability\" on a trip to Russia just before the first anniversary of that country's invasion of Ukraine.. Beijing knows this and yet decided to press ahead nevertheless, in the full knowledge that it will take a hit reputationally because it has calculated that is more important to offer significant moral support to Vladimir Putin at this time.. When Wang Yi met Sergei Lavrov he said, \"I am ready to exchange views with you my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest and I look forward to reaching new agreements.\". Russia's foreign minister said the two were showing solidarity and defending each other's interests despite \"high turbulence on the world stage\", as if this turbulence was something floating in the ether rather than chaos of his own government's making.. This video can not be played. Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. Earlier this week in Beijing, China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that the conflict in Ukraine could spiral out of control if certain countries kept pouring fuel on the fire.. He was referring to the US, a country which is openly giving military assistance to the Ukrainian army but which has warned China not to provide Russia with weapons and ammunition.. Analysts are now asking what options China might consider if it looks like President Putin is facing a humiliating battlefield defeat.. Researchers in America say that Beijing is already supplying Russia with dual-use equipment, technology which can appear to be civilian but which can also, for example, be used to repair jet fighters.. It has also not tried to hide the fact that it is buying up Russian oil and gas to make up for markets its neighbour lost because of sanctions which followed the invasion.. And Vladimir Putin confirmed in his meeting with Wang Yi that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would soon travel to Moscow. It is thought this might happen in the coming months.. In a way, the Kremlin is doing China's dirty work. It is draining Western military resources and putting pressure on Nato and if Russia's economy tanks because of it, does that really matter to Beijing? It will just need more Chinese products for the recovery afterwards.. The problem is that Western countries have been quite united, Russia does not appear able to win and, increasingly, China is being seen standing side by side with a bully who forced a bloody, prolonged war on Europe.. China has to be careful not to bite off more than it can handle, but the rest of the world also will not want Asia's giant dragged into this war to a greater extent than it already is.. ",
