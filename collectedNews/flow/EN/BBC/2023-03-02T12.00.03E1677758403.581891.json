        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. Rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Protests were also held in Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa, near where the disaster happened on Tuesday night.. The government has said an independent investigation will deliver justice.. Three days of national mourning have been declared across the country following the incident, in which a passenger service crashed head on into a freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames. . The front carriages of the passenger train were mostly destroyed.. Many of the 350 passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said \"tragic human error\" was to blame for the disaster.. A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence. He has denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on a technical fault.. Rail union members believe safety systems were not working properly, with repeated warnings about this over many years.. In protest and mourning, rail workers are planning on striking on Thursday at what they say is official neglect of the railways.. \"Pain has turned into anger for the dozens of dead and wounded colleagues and fellow citizens,\" the workers' union said in a statement announcing the strike.. \"The disrespect shown over the years by governments to the Greek railways led to the tragic result,\" it added in comments cited by Reuters news agency.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. But outside a hospital where bodies of the train crash's victims were being brought, a banner was hung claiming that any systemic failings would be covered up in the official investigation now under way.. At a silent vigil in Larissa on Wednesday to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had only been a matter of time.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. \"This is an inadmissible accident. We've known this situation for 30 years,\" a doctor based in Larissa, Costas Bargiotas, told AFP.. A vigil was also held in Athens, outside the offices of Hellenic Train. Later in the day, things turned violent in the same area, with police using tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones and lit fires in the streets.. At the site of the country's worst ever train crash, rescuers yet again worked through the night. . Families have been arriving at a nearby hospital to give DNA samples so that their missing loved ones may be identified.. But this will become an increasingly difficult process as more remains are retrieved of those who were at the front of the passenger train and who bore the full force of the head-on collision and the fire that then ripped through their carriages.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage had reached 1,300C (2,370F), which made it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\"..

        "content": "The coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the ex-workers and compensate others who were affected.. In response, Starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies.. \"We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review,\" Starbucks told the BBC.. In a more than 200 page decision, Michael A Rosas, who is a federal administrative law judge, also ordered Starbucks to rehire another worker that he ruled had been illegally forced out of their job.. Mr Rosas said Starbucks had showed \"a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights\" in response to union campaigns.. The judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay.. It also repeatedly sent high-ranking staff to stores \"in order to more closely supervise, monitor, or create the impression that employees' union activities are under surveillance,\" he said.. The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to safeguard employees' rights to unionise at their workplaces.. Michael Sanabria, a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, said the ruling was \"such a massive win for us, and for the labour movement as a whole.\". \"The decision results from months of tireless organising by workers... demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,\" said Michelle Eisen, a barista at another Starbucks location in Buffalo.. Last year, workers at around 270 of Starbucks stores across the US voted to join unions, despite opposition from the firm. Starbucks has around 9,000 company-owned stores in the US.. Union campaigners have accused the company of dragging its feet at the bargaining table and violating labour laws as it tries to shut down the movement.. Starbucks - which has long prided itself on its reputation as a progressive, worker-friendly employer - has said it respects workers' right to protest.. In recent months the company has raised pay and made other changes in response to the discontent.. This video can not be played. Watch: How UK strike rules could be about to change. ",

        "content": "It is a growing issue for people in the area, her lawyer told BBC News. . The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",

        "content": "A UN official said their submissions were \"irrelevant\" and \"tangential\" to the issues being discussed.. Self-styled guru Nithyananda is wanted in India in several cases, including rape and sexual assault.. Nithyananda, who claims he founded the United States of Kailasa (USK) in 2019, has denied the allegations against him.. USK's appearance at the UN events last week had made headlines in India. The Indian government hasn't publicly commented on the matter yet. . A UN official told the BBC in an email that \"USK representatives attended two UN public meetings in Geneva in February\". . The first was a discussion on the representation of women in decision-making systems, organised by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 22 February. USK representatives also participated in a second discussion on sustainable development, hosted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), on 24 February.. These general discussions are public meetings open to anyone who is interested, said Vivian Kwok, a media officer at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which oversees the two committees.. Ms Kwok said USK's written submission to CEDAW would not be included in their report as it was \"irrelevant to the topic of the general discussion\".. She also said that a statement made by a USK representative at the second discussion would not be taken into consideration as its focus \"was tangential to the topic at hand\".. A video on the UN website of the second session shows that when questions are invited from attendees, a woman introduces herself as Vijayapriya Nithyananda, \"the permanent ambassador of the United States of Kailasa\" and says she wants to ask a question about \"indigenous rights and sustainable development\".. She describes USK as the \"first sovereign state for Hindus\" established by Nithyananda, the \"supreme pontiff of Hinduism\". She also claims that USK has been \"successful with sustainable development\" because it provided necessities such as food, shelter and medical care for free to all its citizens. Her question is regarding what measures can be put in place to \"stop the persecution\" of Nithyananda and the people of Kailasa. . Others who asked questions at the discussion included a representative of an organisation called One Ocean Hub and a lecturer at Essex University.. Former Indian diplomat Preeti Saran, who holds the Asia Pacific seat at CESCR, was among the attendees at the discussion. The BBC has emailed her for comment.. Nithyananda, who was facing charges of rape, fled India in 2019. A female disciple had accused him of rape in 2010, after which he was briefly arrested before getting bail. He was charged in court in 2018.. Days before he left the country, a separate police complaint had also accused him of kidnapping and confining children at his ashram in the western state of Gujarat. . It's unclear where he escaped to and how he reached there. . That same year, he claimed to have bought an island off the coast of Ecuador and founded a new country called Kailasa, named after a mountain in the Himalayas that is considered the abode of the Hindu god Shiva. . At the time, Ecuador denied that he was in the country, and said that \"Nithyananda has not been given asylum by Ecuador or has been helped by the government of Ecuador\".. Nithyananda has not made any public appearances since 2019, though videos of his sermons are regularly released on his social media channels. .  reported last year that Nithyananda's UK representative had attended \"a glamorous Diwali party at the House of Lords\" on the invitation of two Conservative members.. News of the UN event began circulating on Indian social media after Nithyananda's Twitter account tweeted a photo of Vijayapriya Nithyananda.. A tweet thread later appeared to introduce USK's ambassadors to different parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and the Caribbean. . According to its website, Kailasa counts \"two billion practising Hindus\" among its population. It also claims to have a flag, a constitution, a central bank, a passport and an emblem.. ",

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials say they spotted the device during a routine screening. . Officials say Mr Muffley checked in for Allegiant Air Flight 201 at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 65 miles (105km) north of Philadelphia, on Monday morning. . About an hour later, TSA screeners discovered the suspicious item and called FBI specialists, including a bomb technician, to examine the device. . In charging documents, FBI bomb technician Jared Witmier said a 3 inch (7.5cm) device hidden in the lining of the suspect's rolling suitcase was found to contain fuses and explosive powder. . There was a quick fuse, which appeared to be a part of the original manufacture of the compound, and a hobby fuse, which seemed to have been added post-manufacture, according to the criminal complaint.. The \"powder is suspected to be a mixture of flash powder and the dark granulars that are used in commercial grade fireworks\", the FBI court document says. . \"The black powder and flash powder are susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and posed a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.\". The bag also contained \"a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with white powder residue, a wireless drill with cordless batteries\" and two circuit breakers that were taped together. . Five minutes after he was paged over the airport loud speaker, Mr Muffley was seen by security cameras leaving the airport, the court papers say. He was traced to his home in Lansford, Pennsylvania, later on Monday. . He is charged with possession of an explosive in an airport and possessing or attempting to place an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft. . He is due in court on Thursday. . ",

        "content": "The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders.. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea.. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea's son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk. . The OCCRP claimed in a .  that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports.. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material.. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials.. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.  . NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa.. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle.. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. . The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa's Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled . .. The story examined Mr Ayuk's involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians. . After the story was published, the M&G's web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet's entire website for a morning in response to the complaint. . M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website. . Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\".. Last November during the UN's climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called . .. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN's flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk's US fraud conviction. . The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication.. Two weeks later, Climate Home News' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered.. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed. . Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles.. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\". Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered.. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\". . Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\". When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims. . Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication.. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.. ",
