        "content": "The visit comes as Beijing, an ally of Russia, has offered proposals to end the war in Ukraine, to which the West has given a lukewarm reception.. Western countries have warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with weapons. . This will be President Xi's first visit to Russia since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. He is due to have lunch with Mr Putin on Monday followed by talks on Tuesday. . A foreign ministry spokeswoman said China would uphold \"an objective and fair position\" on the war in Ukraine and \"play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace\". . The fact that the Chinese leader is coming signals Beijing's strong support for Moscow. There's no surprise about that: Putin and Xi share a similar world view, both embrace the idea of a multi-polar world.. Last year the two men declared their partnership has no limits. That's not strictly true. . Up until now China has not supplied Russia with lethal aid to help it win the war in Ukraine, though the US claims that China is considering doing so.. As for the declared partnership between Moscow and Beijing, Russia - with an economy a tenth the size of China's - finds itself increasingly in the role of junior partner. . China's peace proposals called for peace negotiations and respect for national sovereignty. But the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine.. In February Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Xi - \"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said. . Some US media have reported that Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky will speak by phone after the Chinese leader's visit to Moscow, but this is yet to be confirmed.. Kyiv has been pushing hard for some kind of engagement. Ukraine believes President Xi is making the visit to send a signal to the world that Russia has at least some allies. . In an interview with the BBC before President Xi's visit was announced, Mr Kuleba said: \"I don't think China has reached the moment now when it wants to, when it's ready to arm Russia. Nor do I think that this visit will result in peace… The visit to Moscow in itself is a message but I don't think it will have any immediate consequences.\". The message, Mr Kuleba said, was \"that China and Russia are very close, close enough for the Chinese leader to visit his Russian counterpart, who is not doing very well. . \"And I think this is the message to the entire world, to the West but also most importantly, to the non-West, that Russia is not alone, that China is talking to them.\". The US is keen for Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky to be in contact. US National Security Council spokesman said it would be \"a very good thing if the two of them talk\". . Meanwhile, China's foreign minister on Thursday urged Kyiv and Moscow to restart peace talks as soon as possible during a phone call with Mr Kuleba, who in turn said the two had discussed the \"significance of the principle of territorial integrity\"..

        "content": "Authorities interpreted the books - about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village - as referring to Hong Kongers and China's government.. The arrests are another deterioration of Hong Konger's rights, critics say.. Human Rights Watch described the arrests as \"shameful\", and said the territory was using its colonial-era sedition law to clamp down on dissent.. Hong Kong media reported police arrested the men, aged 38 and 50, at their apartments on 13 March. They raided their homes in Kowloon and Hong Kong island and seized multiple copies of the books, which are part of a series titled Yangcun.. Both men have been released on bail but must report to the police next month, authorities said.. Officials also confirmed the books were the same that had been the subject of a high-profile trial last year - where a court had to determine if the Yangcun books advocated for rebellion against the state. The court ruled the picture books had \"seditious intention\" and j.  for publishing the books.. The group, aged between 25 and 28, had produced cartoon e-books that some interpreted as trying to explain Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement to children.. In one of the three books, a village of sheep fight back against a group of wolves who are trying to take over their settlement.. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. Under its \"one country, two systems\" principle, residents are supposed to enjoy certain freedoms unavailable on the mainland.. But these rights have been eroded since Beijing in 2020 imposed a national security law in response to the months-long Hong Kong protests against Beijing's control in 2019.. Beijing said the law was needed to bring stability to the city - but critics said it was designed to squash dissent, and weaken Hong Kong's autonomy.. In January, police arrested a 24-year-old student for sedition after he posted a download link of the Yangcun series on Facebook - accompanied by alleged inflammatory statements, local outlet Mingpao reported..

Ukraine has asked Western countries for modern jets . , but because of long training times, these are seen only as long-term options.. It sees the extra aircraft as key to its defences and possible counter-attacks, a year into Russia's invasion.. Other Nato countries are considering sending Soviet-era planes such as the MiG, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the plans, saying that the aircraft would not affect the outcome of Moscow's \"special military operation\", as it calls the war, but only \"bring additional woes for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people\".. \"Of course, during the special military operation, all this equipment will be subject to destruction,\" he added.. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have about 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s.. On Friday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger tweeted . He said \"promises must be kept\" and that he was glad others were answering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for more weapons.. He said Slovakia would also send Ukraine part of its Kub air defence system.. On Thursday, Poland pledged four MiG-29s, to be sent in the coming days, but more are expected to follow.. It is not clear how many of the Slovakian planes are currently operational.. ",

Among the UK banks, shares in Lloyds and Barclays were up 1.3% higher.. Stock markets in France and Germany were up by about 0.6%, and earlier, Japan's Nikkei index had closed 1.2% higher.. The .  said the action reflected their \"confidence in the country's banking system\".. US financial officials said the move was \"most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system\".  . After the failure of two US banks in the past week - Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank - investors have been worried that other banks could also collapse. . US regulators stepped in at the weekend to ensure that customers at SVB and Signature Bank had full access to their money.. Shares in San Francisco-based First Republic had sunk nearly 70% over the last week, amid fears it would be the next bank at risk of a rush of customers withdrawing their deposits. . But the rescue plan by the 11 banks, led by JP Morgan and Citigroup, boosted stock markets, and shares in First Republic were up more than 20% at one point.. However, there are signs that not all worries have been eased.. Shares in First Republic dropped 20% in after-hours stock market trading after the bank said its was suspending its dividend - its payment to shareholders - \"during this period of uncertainty\".. Swetha Ramachandran, investment director at GAM Investments, said authorities were moving \"proactively\".. \"What they're trying to do is really ringfence the specific issues around individual isolated banks to stop them from becoming systemic,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.. \"So this is very different to 2008 which was a widespread issue across the banking sector.\". On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said \"the banking system overall is safe and sound\", while the vice president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Luis de Guindos, said Europe's banking sector was \"resilient\".. Europe has not escaped the jitters in the banking sector, due to difficulties at Swiss bank giant Credit Suisse.. Shares in Credit Suisse sank earlier in the week on concerns over its future, before the Swiss National Bank said on Wednesday that it was supplying the bank with up to £44bn in emergency funds.. Credit Suisse shares opened higher on Friday, but then fell back. The bank's shares are now down by about 22% since the start of the week.. Central banks around the world have sharply raised borrowing costs over the past year to try to curb the pace of overall price rises, or inflation. . The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower, a change that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about whether other firms are facing similar situation.. Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at US asset manager Payden and Regal, said other banks could be caught up in the problem.. \"There could be other vulnerabilities... if central banks are intent on continuing to raise interest rates,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.. \"Historically when that happens we do see fragility, we do see problems in the financial system.\". Before the turbulence in the banking sector erupted, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates further at meetings next week. However, due to recent events, some have speculated these rate rises might be scaled back or even scrapped.. On Thursday, the ECB announced a further increase to interest rates from 2.5% to 3%.. \"For the ECB their core fight right now is against inflation,\" said GAM Investments' Ms Ramachandran.. \"While they're monitoring wider financial market stability, I think their view was that the Credit Suisse issues are idiosyncratic and contained to that specific bank.\" .

With spotlights to illuminate a section of Cronulla's surf known as \"The Alley\", Johnston kept going overnight and had ridden over 700 waves by the end. . The previous record of 30 hours and 11 minutes was held by South African Josh Enslin.. The 40-year-old Johnston, a former pro surfer and distance runner, faced the risk of blindness, infected ears and dehydration, as well as sleep deprivation, hypothermia, shark attack and jellyfish stings.. He emerged briefly from the sea at lunchtime on Friday for a medical check-up, and to receive eye-drops.. Johnston left the beach wearing a black cowboy hat while draped in a thermal blanket.. \"I surfed at two in the morning with him, and the lights actually went out so it was pitch black,\" his brother Ben told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. . \"There were a whole bunch of jellyfish out there, so it was interesting to say the least.\". Speaking ahead of his challenge, Johnston said: \"I thought, I could just do it. I can run for 40 hours,\". \"But, this way, I can surf with people, bring in the community and make a difference for the future.\". Johnston is fundraising for the Chumpy Pullin Foundation, set up in the memory of Australian Olympic snowboarder Alex 'Chumpy' Pullin who drowned off the Gold Coast while spearfishing in 2020. . He is also supporting mental health charities, partly in tribute to his father who took his own life a decade ago.. Three of his friends have also died from mental health conditions, according to media reports. . ",
