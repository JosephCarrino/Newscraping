        "content": "Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has 29%, while third-party candidate Peter Obi has 25%.. The parties of both Mr Abubakar and Mr Obi have called for the election to be cancelled and rerun.. They alleged that the inability of the electoral commission to upload results to its website showed that the results had been manipulated.. Many voters reported problems with uploading results through the new electronic voting system, which was intended to speed up the process.. There were also widespread delays, with many polling stations opening several hours late, and some attacked by armed men. Voting was held overnight, and on Sunday in some areas.. The electoral commission says the opposition parties should take their complaints to court and is pressing ahead with the release of results.. A candidate needs to have the most votes nationwide and at least a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states, plus Abuja, to be declared the winner.. If those thresholds are not reached then there will be a run-off round between the top two candidates.. President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after serving two terms, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. The election had been seen as a referendum on his time in office but Mr Tinubu seems to have managed to mobilise his supporters to vote.. Earlier on Tuesday, a group of angry protesters denounced the electoral commission, known as Inec, outside the national collation centre in the capital, Abuja.. \"Everything happening there is all lies, all lies, lies... they are cooking up results,\" one man told the BBC.. Another group held a counter-protest, urging the electoral commission to \"complete your job\" and calling on \"Nigerians to stand up for democracy\".. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. European Union observers said the electoral body's poor planning and communication had undermined trust in the process.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Mr Atiku's Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999.. Mr Obi ran for president for the first time, promising to challenge the two-party system. . He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. ",

        "content": "Most of those on the wooden vessel, thought to carry 200 people, were said to be from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran. . Officials have warned the final death toll could climb to more than 100.. Rescuers pulled another body from the sea, that of a man, on Tuesday morning.. The three men arrested are said to have sailed the boat from Izmir in Turkey to Calabria in Italy despite bad weather conditions.. Police say they allegedly asked the migrants for about €8,000 (£7,000; $8,500) each to make the long journey.. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for.. The coffins of the victims found so far have been laid out in a sports hall in Crotone - small white caskets for the younger victims and brown ones for the adults - to allow people to pay their respects. At least 12 children including a baby are among the victims.. Relatives of the victims living in northern Europe have arrived to try to get news of their relatives and identify bodies where necessary. . Rescuers said many of the migrants on board had come from Afghanistan, and Pakistan has said 16 of its citizens had survived the disaster, but four were missing.. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. ",

        "content": "It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.. China has denied a lab leak in Wuhan, calling the allegation defamatory. . Mr Wray's comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to \"be more honest\" about Covid's origins.. In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China \"has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. . \"And that's unfortunate for everybody,\" he said.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is a 40-minute drive from a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. Other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI's, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings.. US media reported on Sunday that the US energy department had assessed with \"low confidence\" that Covid leaked from a lab. The agency had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.. On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports \"a whole-of-government effort\" to discover how Covid began.. But he added that US still lacks a clear consensus as to what happened.. \"We're just not there yet,\" he said. \"If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.\". An unclassified report released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.. For months, at the height of the pandemic, the lab leak hypothesis was widely dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theory. Top health officials publicly rejected the idea that the coronavirus could have been created in a lab before escaping.. A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\", but after deep criticism of that investigation, the agency's director-general called for a new inquiry, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\". Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019 and has since led to the deaths of nearly seven million people. . ",
