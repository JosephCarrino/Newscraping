        "content": "Until Thursday, Ukraine had just gone for more than three weeks in a row with no blackouts and and even had surplus in the system. . There had been no Russian attacks for three weeks either, and it looked as if Vladimir Putin's battle to bring down Ukraine's supply was over.. \"Yes, we're doing it, but who started it?\" he said in December, pinning the blame on Kyiv.. It was a far more desperate story at that point. As much as half the energy infrastructure was damaged and a Ukrainian nuclear security expert warned the situation was close to critical.. But during those weeks of quiet, Russia had been stocking up weaponry. In the early hours of Thursday it fired 81 missiles and left four regions grappling with emergency power cuts. By Friday, half a million people still had no power in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city.. \"It's totally cold now. We have food, but only part of it has been cooked,\" said Oleksii as he watched the battery life on his mobile phone slip to 14%.  . Another 500 people live in his block of flats, and when he went to his local \"invincibility centre\" to power up his phone, there were too many people with the same idea.. Another 150,000 people were left with no power in Zhytomyr, two hours' drive south of the Belarus border. The mayor said the next few weeks would be critical and rolling blackouts are looming for this city west of Kyiv.. \"We had three weeks without attacks and we had power,\" said Eugene Herasymchuk. \"And the power in the system allowed local authorities to start up the trolleybuses and trams. That was a big step because before that, public transport was on a pause.\". Kyiv was also hit and one hospital treating 700 people went without heating and hot water for several hours. But for many Ukrainians, it was not long before they were back on the grid.. \"It's safe to say that Ukraine won on the energy front,\" said Tetyana Boyko from civic network Opora, praising the fleet of energy workers and international help. \"Let's pray, but I think the worst-case scenario is over.\". The winter may be over, but Oleksii believes the battle to save Ukraine's power supply from Vladimir Putin's missiles will continue as long as Russia has the ability to strike it.. Every one of Ukraine's thermal and hydroelectric power plants has been damaged since Russia launched its assault on the energy infrastructure last October. Kyiv had already lost the use of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, which is in Russia hands.. Sub-stations have been reduced to hunks of twisted metal, no longer capable of transforming the electricity to power for homes and businesses.. For two weeks in the depth of winter, the BBC followed teams of engineers and technicians rushing to repair the damage that the missiles had done.. One substation had been hit six times with missiles or drones and replacing these damaged transformers will take time.. Transformers soon became Ukraine's number one requirement. It needed more than the world could produce in a year and so far only one high-voltage transformer has been sent, while dozens of lower-power machines have arrived.. As the winter wore on, Ukraine's armed forces grew more adept at shooting down Russia's missiles and drones. . But this week, only 34 of the missiles were destroyed, because Russia used different, high-speed weapons. They included hypersonic Kh-47 Kinzhal missiles as well as anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.. \"They can cause huge, huge destruction,\" said one industry official. . Until Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine began in February 2022, there were 15 nuclear reactors on stream at four power stations. Six of those reactors were at Zaporizhzhia, seized by the occupying military in the early days of the invasion.. For months, the plant has been at the centre of a high-stakes nuclear row, amid accusations that Moscow wants to connect it to Russia's electricity grid.. The other three power stations are South Ukraine and Rivne and Khmelnytskyi in the west. Between them, they now produce half of Ukraine's power.. That may sound bleak, but a combination of an unusually mild winter and sheer hard work means Ukraine has moved back from the brink and the sense of optimism is palpable.. Power plants have been restored and repaired. One source in the industry told the BBC that as the days became sunnier and warmer, it would become harder and harder for Russia's military might to terrorise his country.. The east-central city of Dnipro has endured several deadly missile strikes over the winter, and this week was no different.  . But there have been no problems for weeks with energy supplies.. \"The city has transformed. Finally, street lights are back, and it's no longer scary to walk the city streets,\" said Inna Shtanko, a young mother with a son under the age of two.. Cooking and having a hot shower have become part of the daily routine once more for her family. \"Our psychological state has improved considerably, because our family and other mothers too can easily plan our day.\". There's a similar story in Kherson, occupied by Russian forces until they retreated across the Dnipro river last November.. Life was hard for several weeks after the Russians left the southern city with no basic utilities. . \"We didn't have any electricity for about month and a week, then we had it for two hours a day, then gradually it stopped breaking,\" said local entrepreneur Alexei Sandakov. . Now he boasts a regular power supply, although the pressure on the system is far lower than before the war because the population of 55,000 is a fraction of what it was before the Russians invaded. . Population numbers have fallen across Ukraine, with more than eight million refugees beyond its borders, and that too has put less strain on the energy infrastructure. Consumption is down and the refugees have not yet come back, as one official remarked.. The overall sense is that the damage caused by this latest wave of missiles will be repaired quickly. . There was considerable damage, but engineers have become highly skilled at restoring power within days, even after a major attack.. \"It's like a competition: how quickly can they cause us damage and how quickly can we repair. And we are winning that competition,\" said Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of Kyiv's Energy Industry Research Centre.. In Zhytomyr, Eugene Herasymchuk believes things are looking up. \"A lot of Ukrainians say it's better to have one cold and one dark winter than 100 years with Russia - so I think we can handle this.\". Ukrainians now have everything on their side, according to Mr Kharchenko, from the improving weather to the support of international donors and the professional of staff in the energy industry. But he is more guarded about the future.. \"I don't say we've won the energy war, but I can say we won the energy battle this winter.\". ",

They regard each other as a threatening power that seeks regional dominance. They also support rival sides across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq - and most overtly in Yemen.. Iran has supported Shia Houthi rebels who forced out the Saudi-backed government in 2014, while Saudi Arabia has led a devastating air campaign against the Houthis since the following year.. Saudi Arabia has also accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack it.. In the most serious incident of its kind, drones and missiles struck major Saudi oil facilities in 2019, causing damage and disruption to production. Saudi Arabia and its US ally blamed Iran for the attack - something Iran denied.. Previous attempts at reconciliation have been unsuccessful, but on Friday the two countries said they would reopen embassies within two months. They will also re-establish trade and security relations.. The US cautiously welcomed the announcement. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the administration supported \"any effort to de-escalate tensions in the region\". But he added: \"It really does remain to be seen if Iran is going to meet their obligations.\". UN chief Antonio Guterres thanked China for brokering the deal. . The secretary-general is ready to help efforts \"to ensure durable peace and security in the Gulf region\", his spokesman said. . Israel, which has called for maximum pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme, has not commented.. ",

        "content": "Inviting him to a grand jury indicates he could face charges, experts say. . Ms Daniels says she got $130,000 before the 2016 election in exchange for silence about an alleged affair. . Mr Trump denies they had sexual relations.. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue charges in a case. It is held in secret, and several former aides of Mr Trump have reportedly testified in this case.. If prosecutors proceed, it could be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. The New York Times was the .  Mr Trump had been invited to testify to the grand jury.. If the Manhattan district attorney's office has asked Mr Trump to appear, that indicates the office may be considering indicting the former president, Catherine Christian, a former financial prosecutor in District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, told the BBC. . Mr Trump, she said, is unlikely to accept the opportunity to testify.. \"Most people decline for a host of reasons. You waive immunity, you open yourself up, if you lie, to perjury charges,\" she said. \"You're also letting the district attorney know what your defence is.\". The Stormy Daniels case is one of several cases in which Mr Trump is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. They come as the 76-year-old Republican embarks on another campaign for the White House.. Prosecutors have not commented on news of the invitation, reported in US media and confirmed by Mr Trump's legal team.. The case stems from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair.. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges. Cohen testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (£110,000) just days before the 2016 election. . Mr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. . The former president could face two charges for his actions, Ms Christian said. . The first, she said, could be a straight-forward misdemeanour charge for falsifying business records, as prosecutors allege he listed reimbursements he made to Cohen as legal fees.. The district attorney's office may also seek to charge Mr Trump with a low-level felony, but that presents a much more complicated legal case, she said. . The felony charge would be brought against Mr Trump for falsifying business records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime. . Prosecutors could argue Mr Trump's efforts to hide his payments to Ms Daniels were election campaign related, as he allegedly did so to keep voters from knowing he had engaged in an \"illicit relationship\" with Ms Daniels, Ms Christian said - something she called  \"a novel theory\".. \"That doesn't mean they can't prove it and get a conviction, but it's going to be tough.\". If convicted, Ms Christian said Mr Trump could face probation or a fine. . \"But it would still be a felony, and who wants to be charged with a felony, and who wants to convicted of a felony? Certainly not a former president,\" she said. . On his social media network Truth Social, Mr Trump himself called the investigation a political witch-hunt by what he described as a \"corrupt, depraved, and weaponised justice system\". . Prior to a meeting with the Manhattan DA on Friday, Cohen told media he \"applauded\" Mr Bragg for \"giving Donald the opportunity to come in to tell his story\".  . \"Now, knowing Donald as well as I do understand that he doesn't tell the truth,\" Cohen told the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"It's one thing to turn around and to lie on your untruth social. It's another thing to turn around and lie before a grand jury.\". Legal wrangling over the allegations about Ms Daniels were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency. . A federal inquiry into the Stormy Daniels case was dropped in 2021 after he left office but Manhattan District Attorney's Office has been running a separate investigation since 2018..

The 35-year-old suspect, named only as Philipp F, had a licence to own the weapon for sporting purposes.. The country is preparing a new law involving tighter curbs on gun ownership, the interior minister said.. Seven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in Thursday's attack which unfolded at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the city.. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) to report that shots had been fired, and officers were on site four minutes later.. Video appeared to show the gunman firing through a window. He then stormed the building where dozens of people had gathered, firing nine magazines of ammunition before apparently turning the gun on himself after police arrived.. Eight people were injured, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. She survived but her unborn baby was killed. . Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the death toll could rise.. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers saved many lives. He described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history.. Officials said the suspect had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member before leaving \"on bad terms\". . Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century.. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members.. On Friday, Hamburg Police Chief Ralf Martin Meyer said officers visited the man in February after they received an anonymous letter claiming he \"bore particular anger toward religious believers, in particular toward Jehovah's Witnesses\".. The letter also said he \"might be suffering from a mental illness, although it had not been medically diagnosed\". . Police said he was co-operative and had an open conversation with the officers. \"The bottom line is that an anonymous tip in which someone says they're worried a person might have a psychological illness, isn't in itself a basis for [such] measures,\" Chief Meyer said.. Forensic experts worked at the scene of the shooting on Deelböge street through the night but have since left the area. . Mourners have left floral tributes near to the front door. One man, holding his little boy and girl by the hand, told the BBC he tried to come home last night but his way was blocked by police wielding assault rifles.. Germany already has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a licence.. In 2021, there were about one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters.. After mass arrests were made last December . , the German authorities have been under pressure to tighten the country's gun laws even further.. ",
