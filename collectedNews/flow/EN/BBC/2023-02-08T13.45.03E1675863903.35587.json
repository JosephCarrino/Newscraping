        "content": "Watch: Three testy moments during the State of the Union. The Democrat stressed the importance of finding consensus as he addressed a divided Congress, where the lower chamber now has a Republican majority. . But a series of interruptions and heckles showed the uphill task it will be to find co-operation. . In their speech, Republicans accused the president of \"woke fantasies\".. Mr Biden's words were received by a packed chamber and high-profile guests - including U2's Bono - as well as Supreme Court justices. . Over the president's shoulder at the rostrum in the House of Representatives was one of his most vocal critics, the Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy.. Mr Biden extended an olive branch to the opposition party, which took over the lower chamber last month with vows to investigate the president's family and Cabinet.. \"To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can't work together in this new Congress,\" said the president.. \"We've been sent here to finish the job!\" he added.. The president focused mainly on domestic issues, hailing the resilience and strength of the US economy. . Unemployment dropped to a half-century low in January and there are signs that the worst inflation in four decades is cooling. But the president acknowledged American families needed more \"breathing room\".. Despite Mr Biden saying he wanted unity, he also took shots at Republicans and at one point accused them of wanting to cut welfare for pensioners. . Half of the chamber erupted, with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - the main heckler of the night - shouting \"You're a liar!\". Mr Biden also said that two years after supporters of his predecessor Donald Trump rioted at the US Capitol, America's democracy was \"unbowed and unbroken\".. He made minimal reference in his hour-long speech to the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that gripped the nation as it crossed US territory before being shot down off the coast of South Carolina.. The president said he was committed to working constructively with the rival superpower but cautioned: \"Make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\" . In response to Mr Biden's speech, Beijing said it would \"firmly defend\" its interests and urged the US to work on repairing relations.. Republicans have been demanding to know why Mr Biden waited a week to act on the balloon. The president's administration has said it wanted to avoid risk to civilians from falling debris.. The speech was light on foreign policy in general, with Ukraine - the main topic 12 months ago - only getting a mention towards the end when Mr Biden said the US would stand with Kyiv \"as long as it takes\".. This video can not be played. Huckabee Sanders: Biden has been hijacked by woke mob. Mr Biden aired his political wish-list, calling for an assault weapons ban, a minimum tax for billionaires, and access to pre-school for three and four-year-olds - though many of the proposals are likely to go nowhere in Congress. . He also condemned \"outrageous\" profits by oil companies, but drew scorn from Republicans in the chamber when he said: \"We're going to need oil for at least another decade.\". Following the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis last month, Mr Biden also challenged lawmakers to pass long-stalled reforms to policing, saying: \"Do something.\" . Mr Nichols' mother and stepfather were in the audience as guests of First Lady Jill Biden. . The president also emphasised that \"most cops are good, decent people\", drawing a rare standing ovation by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.. The 80-year-old is expected to announce plans for another presidential run soon, but his age was raised as an issue by the Republican who delivered the party's rebuttal speech after he finished.. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused his government of being more preoccupied by \"woke fantasies\" than \"the hard reality Americans face every day\".. Ms Huckabee Sanders, 40, is the country's youngest governor and best known for her tenure as press secretary to former President Trump.. In her pre-recorded message, she said: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn't start and never wanted to fight.\" . Republicans had left the Congress chamber by this point, departing quickly after the president's speech wrapped up.. As Mr Biden mingled with some members of Congress, one Democrat shouted with a thumbs up: \"Mr President, that was awesome.\". ",

The packages were strung up with buoys and some labelled with a Batman symbol.. Pictures released by New Zealand police and defence officials also showed cocaine packets labelled with a black four-leaf clover symbol.. These were the \"trademark logos\" for the drug producers, believed to be in South America, said New Zealand officials.. \"This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealand agencies, by some margin,\" said New Zealand's police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday.. \"It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,\" he added.. New Zealand's navy deployed a vessel to retrieve the massive shipment last week, which comprised 81 bales of cocaine.. They were brought to Auckland in New Zealand's North Island on Tuesday and taken to a security facility to be documented and destroyed, officials said. . \"We believe we have dealt a significant blow to an international criminal syndicate's operation,\" Mr Coster said.. Authorities did not disclose details of the operation or how they found the drugs. But they said their partners in the Five Eyes intelligence group - which includes Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US - had provided assistance.. ",

        "content": "Now the Russians are attacking from three sides, with regular troops and fighters from the notorious Wagner mercenary group. The Russians have reached one of the main highways into the city, and are closing in on the outskirts.. There is house-to-house fighting in some areas on the outskirts, with \"hard battles for every home\" according to the Ukrainian military.. It feels like Bakhmut is on borrowed time. If so, Ilya and Oleksii intend to use every second of it.. The two Ukrainian National Guardsmen move swiftly and silently across open ground on the frontlines and then plunge into a trench. . Their camouflage backpacks contain weapons of war - a drone, a modified hand grenade, and a Velcro strap. . The German-made grenade had a tail fin attached, made with a 3D printer, to ensure it exploded on impact.. Ilya - an IT guy turned intelligence officer - makes short work of velcroing the grenade to the drone. Then he launches it towards enemy forces nestled in their trenches, a kilometre and a half away. . \"We know there are a lot of Russian soldiers there, walking, living, and sitting,\" said Oleksii, the drone pilot. \"And so, we just give them [a] gift.\" . \"The aim is not to kill a lot of soldiers but to make them afraid of our sky, to make them watch out every second. It's psychological pressure.\". He shows us a drone's eye view as he releases the grenade over a frozen expanse. We can see the impact on his screen but can't tell if they were casualties below. . Oleksii says the fighting in Bakhmut is tough, emotionally and physically: \"It's hard, but we are staying here, and we will protect Bakhmut and the area around it as much as we can.\". But Ukraine is counting the cost and there's speculation it could withdraw to avoid further heavy losses.  . In the Kremlin, a clock is ticking - counting down to the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of its neighbour, on 24 February 2022. President Putin wants a victory before then. Taking Bakhmut would give him one, and bring him closer to his aim of capturing all of the mineral rich Donbas region.. To reach Bakhmut you drive along winding back roads. The route we used for previous trips last September is now classed as \"suicidal\" because of constant Russian attacks.. The city is now a shell. The thud of incoming and outgoing fire echoes through empty streets. Missiles have punched holes through buildings. Power and water supplies are long gone, along with most of the pre-war population of about 70,000. . But some families have remained here, with their children, sheltering in the shadows.. Anna, who is seven, is a bright spark in an airless dark basement. Tiny gold earrings glint in her ears, her blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she's wearing a pink sweater. Her colourful drawings line the walls but it still feels like a prison cell.. This video can not be played. Watch: Anna has befriended Pavlo Dyachenko from Ukraine's White Angels, who brings her a sleeping bag. Anna lives with her mother Yulia, grandfather Valery, two cats and Mushka the dog. She proudly shows us her favourite soft toys, but her blue eyes stand out against her pale complexion. . \"I sit in the cellar almost all day long,\" she tells me in a lilting voice. \"Outside I take Mushka for a walk, but she's afraid of these booms and constantly comes back. Only in the morning, when it is quiet at dawn, I can take her out.\". Yulia sits in the gloom nearby, as Anna lists her friends who have already fled. \"I miss them all,\" she says. \"Arina might be in Poland, Masha in Western Ukraine. Diana went somewhere else. Everyone left.\". But Yulia is staying put with her daughter. \"Of course, I am worried,\" she tells me. \"But I think it is more or less safe. At least we have everything here, everything is prepared. We think nowhere in Ukraine is safe and we have no means to go abroad.\". Their basement shelter is well stocked with food and water, and they get regular deliveries from the White Angels, a unit of Ukrainian police who provide aid and carry out evacuations. . The team leader, Pavlo Dyachenko, lights up when he sees Anna. In the depths of war, they have forged a bond.. He has brought Anna a new sleeping bag to keep her warm, but he would rather be getting her and her family out of the line of fire. . \"I don't understand why they are deciding to stay,\" he said. \"Bakhmut is under attack in the evening, in the morning, in the night. It's very dangerous with bombing and shelling all the time.\". More thuds above ground amplify his point. . The shelling usually intensifies as midday approaches - part of the rhythm of warfare in Bakhmut. After exhausting overnight battles, troops on both sides sleep late into the mornings, before getting back to their guns.  . We race out of the city and onwards through rolling hills that offer a commanding view of the area. . \"These heights are more important for the Russians than Bakhmut itself,\" said a Ukrainian colleague. \"If they can bring their artillery here, they can target bigger cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. \". Bakhmut holds, for now, but for how much longer.. ",

        "content": "Like others, he believes that he is more likely to find his missing brother if he sifts through the rubble himself.. Ismail, a 26-year-old supermarket cashier, had been staying with relatives in Hatay province on the Syrian border at the time of the earthquake.  . Others, including his brother-in-law, were pulled from the remains of the building later that day, but Ismail has not been found, Samet said.. \"I'm missing him so much. I have come from Bahrain to Turkey to search for him. He's my one and only brother,\" he told the BBC.. Samet described Ismail as intelligent and \"shy with girls\". He said he was desperate for good news, but felt there was \"no help\" with the search.. After arriving in Turkey, Samet waited for hours in Istanbul for a flight to take him to Adana in the south of the country, before beginning the hours-long drive to Hatay province.. \"It's so cold here. Life is difficult,\" he said by WhatsApp message late on Tuesday night after arriving in the province, which has been devastated by the earthquake.. With nowhere to stay, he warmed himself by a fire through the night, as he waited for daylight so he could begin the search for Ismail.. Samet is not alone. The BBC has spoken to people from across Turkey and abroad who have been travelling down to areas hit by the earthquake to search for missing loved ones. . In the city of Antakya, men armed with pickaxes and crowbars sifted through the rubble of a fallen building on Tuesday, looking for survivors. They told the BBC they were family members of the building's residents and had come from Istanbul to search for their relatives. . Medical student Aylin Pulat could not get hold of several members of her family, including her parents, after the earthquake struck.. She is based in Mugla, more than 1,000km (620 miles) from her family home in Adiyaman.. With no news on her family's fate, she took a four-hour bus trip, a two-hour flight and a more than two-hour drive back to her home city to find out if they were alive.. To her great relief, she arrived to find that her siblings and parents had survived. But 20 other relatives had died.. \"When I arrived, I saw so much of the city was destroyed and there was no safe place for people to get shelter,\" she said.. \"The only relief I got was to see that almost all of my [immediate] family were safe. I wasn't sure before getting there.. \"When I found them, they were all dressed in pyjamas and that's how I knew they had escaped with nothing. We all just froze.\". She said she could hear noises from some fallen buildings, but that rescue efforts were being left largely to residents of the city.. \"People are just waiting helplessly to reach their loved ones under the rubble. We need support here as soon as possible.\". This video can not be played. Turkey earthquake: Drone flies over Hatay revealing extent of destruction. ",
