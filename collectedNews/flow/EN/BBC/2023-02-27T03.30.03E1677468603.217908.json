        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. The vessel broke apart while trying to land near the coastal town of Crotone in the Calabria region. Survivors said at least 150 people were aboard.. Many of them were fleeing difficult conditions, Italy's president said.. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who visited the scene, said as many as 30 people may still be missing. . A baby thought to be only a few months old was among the dead, according to Italy's Ansa news agency.. Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort. . The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . The exact number of people who were on the boat when it broke apart is not clear - rescue workers told the AFP news agency that the vessel had been carrying \"more than 200 people\", which would mean more than 60 people unaccounted for. . The boat, which sailed from Turkey several days ago, was carrying passengers from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran. . Large numbers of people fleeing conflict or poverty cross from Africa to Italy every year.. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, told Rai News. . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived. . According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

        "content": "Watch: On board with Ukraine's attack helicopter pilots. For helicopter pilots in war-time Ukraine, there is little margin for error. . Just ask Roman. . He has flown countless combat missions for Ukraine's Sikorsky Brigade and been decorated for valour. He tells us his age - 34 - but not his last name.  . \"The closer to the target, the lower we fly. It's one or two metres above ground,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's not enough just to strike the target. You have to come back safe and bring your crew and helicopter back safely for the next mission.\"  . Over the past year some of his fellow pilots have not made it back.. We were given rare access to Ukraine's war in the skies at an air strip on a patch of open ground. We can't say where it is - if Russia could identify the location, it would be a major target. . We watch Roman take off for his latest sortie on Ukraine's eastern front with our camera in the cockpit. His helicopter is followed by two others; their blades slice the air beneath a muddy grey sky.  . Below them a Ukrainian trench zigzags across the landscape, and a village lays deserted. . They speed across a frozen lake as if skating on ice. Half an hour later they return, having unleashed 80 missiles.    . Roman comes in to land circling low enough over our heads for us to see him wave from the window. He's renowned among fellow airmen in his brigade for executing difficult manoeuvres - a Ukrainian top gun in an ageing Soviet aircraft.  . His Mi-8 helicopter is about as old as he is, and lacks heavy armour, or modern warning systems about incoming missiles.  Every mission could be his last.. \"Of course, there is some risk,\" he says after touching down. \"I just don't think about this. If it happens, it will not be my problem, it will be a problem for my relatives\". It sounds like a joke, but his expression is concealed by his balaclava.. He will not disclose his target, but chances are it was . .. \"It was just an ordinary mission. You concentrate 100% on your task,\" he says. \"You think of your guys waiting for you on the ground. They are really striving if they call for aviation.\" . What he doesn't think about is the Russian troops on the receiving end.   . \"If they came here with war,\" he tells me, \"we are just protecting our country. We are not aggressors.  We are the victim. And if to win this war we should kill Russian soldiers, we are ready to kill them all.\". As soon as the helicopters land, maintenance crews converge, refuelling and rearming the aircraft to be ready for the next flight.. The missiles are loaded by hand. One is inscribed with a crude message to Russian troops. . Within minutes Roman has co-ordinates for a new target and is wheels up again. . He says Ukraine can't win this war with the Soviet equipment it's got. . A spokesman for his brigade spells it out.  . \"We need new helicopters with navigation equipment, high precision weapons and ammunition,\" he tells us. \"We need everything.\". Add this to the fighter jets already requested by President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it's a long list for what may be a long war. . When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded last year, Roman was part of a Ukrainian peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now this former peacekeeper sees a danger of endless conflict with Russia.. \"Just look back at our history,\" he says. \"We have always had problems with our neighbour. When we win this one if they don't change, they will come back to attack us again, in years or in decades.\". ",

        "content": "The meeting agreed to support confidence-building steps and \"to work towards a just and lasting peace\".. As the talks took place, a Palestinian gunman shot dead two Israelis in the occupied West Bank.. The Israeli military said it was pursuing the gunman and reinforcing troop numbers in the West Bank, deploying two additional battalions. It confirmed that one of those killed in the village of Hawara, near Nablus, was a soldier. . Israel's government described the killings in Hawara as \"a Palestinian terror attack\".. Hours after Sunday's shooting, a large group of settlers entered the same village and began throwing stones and setting trees and cars alight. . At least 15 houses and a number of cars have been burned, according to Palestinian sources. Several families had to be evacuated from their homes.. The Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said hundreds were injured.. Nearby in the West Bank, in Za'tara, a Palestinian man was killed after being shot when Israeli settlers and soldiers entered the village, Palestinian health officials say.. The summit in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba was called following a recent rise in deadly violence that has stoked fears of a wider conflict.. It brought together Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs for the first time in many years. The US president's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, was also present.. The first point of the summit's communique read: \"The two sides [Palestinian and Israeli] affirmed their commitment to all previous agreements between them, and to work towards a just and lasting peace.. \"They reaffirmed the necessity of committing to de-escalation on the ground and to prevent further violence.\". According to the statement, Israel made a commitment to stop discussing new settlement building for four months. In return, it is understood the Palestinians will not take action against Israel at the UN. . The five parties also agreed to hold further talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, next month.. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he \"welcomed\" the commitments made by both sides, adding that more work is needed in coming months \"to build a stable and prosperous future for Israelis and Palestinians alike\".. But Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - the leader of the far-fight grouping in Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition - said \"there will not be a freeze on construction and development in the settlement, not even for one day\". He added that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will \"continue to act to counter terrorism\" without limitations. . Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, condemned the Palestinian Authority (PA) for taking part in what they called \"worthless\" talks.. The attack on two Israelis at Hawara on Sunday has underlined the lack of influence the PA has over armed groups and lone wolf attackers.. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shooting, which took place on a busy road that often sees friction between Palestinians and settlers.. In response, Netanyahu said his administration would \"continue to act by all means ... to deter the terrorists and maintain Israel's security\".. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces, and on the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in attacks, all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.. The recent flare up in violence has included two Israeli military raids - in Jenin refugee camp and Nablus Old City which killed 10 and 11 Palestinians respectively - in the most deadly operations of their kind since 2005.. In both cases, the IDF said the aim was to arrest wanted men who had carried out shooting attacks targeting settlers or soldiers and were planning further attacks. Palestinian militants and civilians were killed.. Last month, a Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue in a settlement in occupied East Jerusalem killed six Israelis and one Ukrainian citizen - the deadliest attack of its kind since 2008.. There is particular concern about rising tension in the coming weeks when the Islamic holy month of Ramadan will again overlap with the Jewish Passover holiday.  . ",

His brother-in-law Joe Henry broke the news on Instagram, writing that he had \"exited this earthly plane\", alongside an old black-and-white photo of him.. \"I've known him since I was 15, in the spring of our lives in Michigan so many years now gone,\" writes singer-songwriter Henry, who is married to Madonna's sister Melanie Ciccone.. The cause of his death has not yet been revealed.. Madonna has not publicly commented on Ciccone's passing, but the pop star did like Joe Henry's Instagram post that revealed the news. .

        "content": "Further results will not be formally announced until 10:00 GMT on Monday.. Following widespread delays and attacks on some polling stations on Saturday, voting was postponed until Sunday in parts of the country.. Voting continued through the night in some areas.. Turnout appears to be high, especially among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters.. This makes it the biggest democratic exercise in Africa.. The election has seen an unprecedented challenge to the two-party system that has dominated Nigeria for 24 years.. Peter Obi from the previously little known Labour Party, Mr Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are all seen as potential winners. There are 15 other presidential candidates.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. Saturday's voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, as well as scattered reports of ballot-box snatching and attacks by armed men, especially in southern areas, where Mr Obi has strong backing. . Dr Nkem Okoli was just about to vote in the Lekki district of the biggest city Lagos when masked men attacked the polling station.. \"There was pandemonium. There were bottles flying everywhere,\" she told the BBC. \"They broke [the ballot box]. They stole the phones of the officials. Now we can't vote.\". In some areas, voting did not begin until around 18:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after polls were due to close.. First-time voter Susan Ekpoh told the BBC that she spent 13 hours at her polling station in the capital, Abuja, only leaving at midnight.. She said when it got dark, election officials said they needed light to see what they were doing, so she and others . The southern Bayelsa state was among those areas where voting was delayed until Sunday - it is not clear how many parts of the country saw voting postponed.. Harrison Rosaline said she waited for five hours to vote on Saturday in Bayelsa's capital, Yenagoa, without seeing any election officials. But she returned, with her two-week old baby, and is delighted to have finally cast her ballot.. \"I was motivated because I want a better Nigeria. I want this country to be good for everybody, including my baby,\" she told the BBC.. There is tension in parts of Rivers and Lagos states, where some political parties have asked their members to go to the centres where votes are being collated, to prevent them being manipulated.. There have also been complaints over the use of the recently introduced electronic voting system, with many voters accusing electoral officials of refusing to upload the results at the polling units as they are supposed to.. However, in those areas where voting went smoothly, results are being posted outside individual polling stations.. This video can not be played. Voters making sure the ballots cast are counted. The results from tens of thousands of polling stations around the country are being added up. An official from the electoral body in each of Nigeria's 36 states will then travel to the capital, Abuja, where the results will be announced state-by-state.. Final results are not expected before Monday at the earliest, and possibly not until Wednesday.. At a press briefing on Saturday, electoral chief Mahmood Yakubu apologised for the delays in voting.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. Whoever wins will have to deal with a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives.. Mr Obi, 61, enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the largely Christian south.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted because one of the two traditional parties is more likely to win.. The PDP's Mr Abubakar, 76, is the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Mr Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Lagos during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies..
