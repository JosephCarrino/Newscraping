        "content": "Abby Zwerner, 25, intends to sue the Newport News school district for alleged negligence.. She is recovering after being shot at Richneck Elementary on 6 January. . The notice of claim was obtained by the Associated Press news agency through a public records request. . It outlines allegations of previous behavioural issues the child is said to have had at school, including cursing at staff and teachers, trying to whip students with his belt and choking a teacher. . The week of the shooting, the boy allegedly \"slammed\" Ms Zwerner's phone and broke it, according to the claim notice. . He was given a one-day suspension and shot Ms Zwerner in her classroom the day he returned to school. Police have described the shooting at \"intentional\". . Lawyers for Ms Zwerner have previously said that school leaders were warned three times that the boy might have a gun on the day of the shooting. . The boy's backpack was searched, but no gun was found. No further action was taken.. \"It is a miracle that more people were not harmed,\" lawyer Diane Toscano, wrote in the notice. . \"The shooter spent his entire recess with a gun in his pocket, a gun that was loaded and ready to fire ... while lots of first-grade students played.\". In a public statement last month, the child's family said the boy had an \"acute disability\". They said the boy took part in a care plan at the school related to his disability, which usually involved one of his parents attending school with him every day. He was unaccompanied for the first time the week of the shooting. . The school's superintendent lost his job amid the fallout from the incident and the assistant principal resigned. . The teacher involved in the alleged choking described in the claim confirmed the incident to the Associated Press but asked not to be named. She said in 2021, the boy came up behind her, locked his forearms around her neck and pulled her backwards. . She said she informed school administrators of the incident but did not receive the type of response she had hoped for.. The boy was later moved to another school.. ",

        "content": "Dramatic footage showed a man carrying the baby, covered in dust, after she was pulled from debris in Jindayris.. A doctor at a hospital in nearby Afrin said she was now in a stable condition. . The building in which her family lived was one of about 50 reportedly destroyed by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Jindayris, an opposition-held town in Idlib province that is close to the Turkish border.. The baby's uncle, Khalil al-Suwadi, said relatives had rushed to the scene when they learned of the collapse.. \"We heard a voice while we were digging,\" he told AFP news agency on Tuesday. \"We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord [intact], so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.\". Paediatrician Hani Maarouf said the baby had arrived at his hospital in a bad condition, with \"several bruises and lacerations over all her body\".. \"She also arrived with hypothermia because of the harsh cold. We had to warm her up and administer calcium,\" he added. . She was photographed lying in an incubator and connected to a drip, as a joint funeral was held for her mother Afraa, father Abdullah and her four siblings.. They are among 1,800 people known to have been killed by the earthquake in Syria, according to the Damascus-based government and the White Helmets, whose volunteer first responders operate in opposition-held areas. . Another 4,500 people have been killed in Turkey, where the epicentre was.  . The White Helmets have so far reported 1,020 deaths, but they have warned that figure is expected to \"rise dramatically\".. \"Time is running out. Hundreds still trapped under the rubble. Every second could mean saving a life,\" they tweeted on Tuesday. . \"We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and international bodies to provide material support and assistance to organisations responding to this disaster.\". The UN has vowed to use \"any and all means\" possible to get aid to people in the north-west, but it has said that deliveries have been halted temporarily due to damaged roads and other logistical issues.. It has also urged governments not to politicise aid delivery when so many are in desperate need. . A UN Security Council agreement authorises the use of just one border crossing for deliveries from Turkey into the north-west. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of \"cross-line\" aid.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people in the north-west - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian aid to survive.. ",
