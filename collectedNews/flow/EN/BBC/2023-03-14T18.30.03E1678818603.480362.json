        "content": "Is this the start of a financial crisis?. US stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, and some of the US regional banks saw big gains. . Regulators in the UK, the US and Asia have acted quickly to try to contain any fallout from SVB's demise.. The Bank of Japan moved to keep financial markets stable after its leading stock index fell 2.1%.. Investors have been worried that other banks may be exposed to similar problems.. Until last week's shock collapse, SVB was a relatively little-known bank - it was the 16th largest in the US.. However, a decision to invest in assets such as government bonds when interest rates were at record lows left SVB exposed to huge losses when central banks started raising rates.  . There is concern that other banks could be caught out in the same way. . Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"I think SVB was a badly-run bank that took too much risk in one sector and was caught out by higher interest rates which if managed properly it would not have been.. \"But higher interest rates will bring more challenges to banks, the economy and start-up firms for sure.\" . In the US, shares in a number of regional banks had plunged on Monday on worries over wider problems. But as trading began on Tuesday, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank - which had seen its share price tank by 62% on Monday - jumped 50%.. Overnight in Japan, major lenders such as the country's largest bank MUFG, had seen their share price tumble by more than 8%. An index of Japanese banking stocks, known as the Topix Banks Index, plunged by 7.4%, despite reassurances from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). . \"Japanese financial institutions' direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,\" said a BoJ official. . The European Stoxx banking index opened lower on Tuesday but then recovered to stand nearly 3% higher.. Separately Credit Suisse's share price continued to tumble after it admitted it found \"material weaknesses\" in its internal controls over financial reporting. It also announced that it would slash its bonus pot - although it said bankers will still get a share of 1bn Swiss francs (£900m).. Credit Suisse's share price fell by 1.9%.. In the UK, bank shares - which saw sharp falls on Monday - were all mostly higher by Tuesday afternoon. . SVB was taken over by US regulators at the weekend after a surprise sale of some bonds last Wednesday sparked a run on the bank. . By the end of Thursday, customers of the bank - mainly in the technology sector - . .. New York-based Signature Bank, which focuses on the cryptocurrency industry, also collapsed at the weekend, Meanwhile, HSBC rescued SVB's UK business for £1.. There is now speculation that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will curb an interest rate rise next week to quell turmoil in the banking sector. . The Fed has been raising interest rates to calm the pace at which prices are rising - which is known as inflation.. On Tuesday, new figures revealed that the annual rate of US inflation eased to 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January.. The US Fed has been raising its key interest rate by as much as 0.75 percentage points, although in February its rate-setters voted for a smaller 0.25 percentage point increase. . ",

        "content": "The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January.. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington.. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an \"epidemic\".. But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives.. Mr Biden's executive order  - which does not require the approval of Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks.. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: \"While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.\". The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over \"red flag\" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it \"would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives\", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will \"double down on the progress made\" in last year's bill..

        "content": "Is this the start of a financial crisis?. When the US president himself goes out of his way to tell people that their money is safe, then you know the government is taking a financial crash seriously.. Joe Biden's assurances on Monday weren't just for the customers of the two failed banks either. There are wider ramifications, in the US and across the world.. Here are five of the big questions, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.. The US government has long guaranteed bank deposits under $250,000 - and if you are like most people, you probably do not have more than that sitting in a bank account. . SVB and Signature had a different set of customers: SVB catered largely for start-up tech firms, while Signature Bank was a commercial bank focusing on corporate customers. Many of those accounts held amounts exceeding that $250,000 level. . But action taken over the weekend by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) meant even those customers will not lose their money. . President Biden said this week that those moves should reassure Americans worried about the banking system: \"Your deposits will be there when you need them.\" . Meanwhile, . , bringing relief to UK tech firms who warned they could go bust without help.. The move meant customers and businesses who had been unable to withdraw their money were now able to access it as normal.. Bank shares in the US, Asia and Europe slumped following the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors fretted about the general state of the banking sector.. Smaller US lenders were particularly hard hit, although they rallied on Tuesday. The initial sell-off came despite them reassuring customers that they had access to enough cash to be able to protect themselves from shocks.. Investors are worried that the failures of the two banks are a sign of troubles at other firms.. Both SVB and Signature Bank had similar characteristics, in that their business models were too concentrated in one sector. They were also overly exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates.. Since most banks spread their exposure across lots of sectors, and also have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low.. However, the failures have highlighted the fact that many banks are riskier than they might look, because many will have sustained losses on their investments in government bonds as interest rates soared, pushing their value down.. That's a prospect investors have been waking up to in recent days, and is one reason why bank shares fell.. SVB is a crucial lender for early-stage businesses, so its collapse led to fears about a knock-on impact to many other industries, from climate tech to medical research.. The company is the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. And although the UK arm of SVB was small with just over 3,000 business customers, its collapse would have created \"a serious risk to some of our most promising companies in technology and life sciences\", UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said.. One company that was caught up in the fallout was US-based online crafts marketplace Etsy.. Over the weekend, the company said that it had experienced a delay in issuing payments to some sellers related to the collapse of SVB.. It said teams \"worked around the clock to implement a solution\" and that it was able to issue the deposits on Monday.. In the UK, the government and the Bank of England worked over the weekend to scramble together the HSBC's purchase of SVB, which involved no taxpayer money. HSBC paid just £1 for SVB's UK arm.. American regulators have tried to sell SVB. They have also created a completely new lending programme. It allows banks that are facing similar problems to use some of their financial assets as the means to get a loan from the Federal Reserve, America's central bank.. This newly created programme essentially acts as a backstop to make sure banks will be able to meet all the needs of their depositors. . But the question of whether the government is bailing out a troubled bank remains a hot-button political issue, reflecting lingering anger over aid provided to Wall Street during the 2008 financial crisis. . President Biden on Monday said the leadership of any bank that is taken over by the FDIC will be fired, making it clear those responsible will be held responsible. He went further to assure the American people will not pay the price.. \"No losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Let me repeat that: No losses will be borne by the taxpayer,\" Mr Biden said.  Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund.. But the reality is most Americans are bank customers. The fees that are charged to banks eventually roll down to the consumer. So even if it's not through their taxes, Americans are in fact, on the hook.. The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to try and slow down the economy. But rising interest rates were partly to blame for this crisis.. Figures out on Tuesday showed US annual inflation at 6% in February, with persistently higher prices highlighting the challenge for the Fed.. Now there is a general nervousness among investors about where the next crisis caused by rising rates could turn up. . Who is it that will be at risk? Some investors and financial analysts are even speculating that the Federal Reserve will stop hiking rates in response to the events of the past few days, or even start cutting.. There is no playbook for this, it is uncharted territory. . ",

        "content": "Joe Biden: \"Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs\". Under the Aukus pact Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs - at least three - from the US.. The allies will also work to create a new fleet using cutting-edge tech, including UK-made Rolls-Royce reactors.. Beijing has strongly criticised the significant naval deal.. Its foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the three nations of \"walking further and further down the path of error and danger\".. China's UN mission had earlier also accused the Western allies of setting back nuclear non-proliferation efforts.. But US President Joe Biden said the deal was aimed at bolstering peace in the region and stressed the submarines would be \"nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed\". . Speaking alongside the UK and Australian prime ministers - Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese - in San Diego, California, Mr Biden said the deal would not jeopardise Australia's commitment to being a nuclear-free country. . For Australia, it is a major upgrade to the US ally's military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology. . The submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. . Under the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.. From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more. . After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS. . This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.. President Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open. . \"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.. He also pledged of $4.6bn (£3.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.. Australia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (£201bn) over 30 years - marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".. Anthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs. The UK PM also said thousands of jobs would be created in Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, where some of the construction would take place.. Mr Sunak said that in the 18 months since the Aukus alliance was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown. . \"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division,\" Mr Sunak said.. As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also .  over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states.. The Aukus security alliance - announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing's foreign ministry last week reiterated its position that the pact risked creating an arms race.. But the three Western countries say the security deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific. . While all three leaders have stressed how the deal will strengthen their co-operation, it hasn't been without its political fallout.. In 2021, Australia .  in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris. . Australia also faces a delicate diplomatic situation with China - its largest trading partner. Analysts say the question will be whether it can continue to strengthen its military ties with US, while fostering commercial ties with Beijing.. ",
