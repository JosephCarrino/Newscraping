        "content": "The Wikileaks founder is expected to appeal to the High Court if she approves his extradition.. Mr Assange is wanted in the US over documents leaked in 2010 and 2011.. The Supreme Court ruled last month that Mr Assange's case raised no legal questions over assurances the US had given the UK over how he is likely to be treated.. Ms Patel must now decide whether the US's request for Mr Assange meets remaining legal tests - including a promise not to execute him.. Julian Assange's lawyer Mark Summers QC told chief magistrate Paul Goldspring that the home secretary would be receiving \"serous submissions\" on US sentencing law and practices.. \"You, of course, have no option but to send this case to the Secretary of State,\" he said.. \"It is not for me to raise fresh evidence [at this stage] even though there have been serious developments in this case.\". Mr Assange spoke briefly on a video link from Belmarsh Prison during the seven-minute hearing, to confirm his name and date of birth and to acknowledge he understood what was happening.. \"I am duty-bound to send your case to the Secretary of State for a decision on whether you will be extradited,\" the judge told him.. \"You have the right to appeal to the High Court and if you exercise your right to appeal it will not be heard until [Ms Patel] has made her decision.\". Scores of people protesting against Mr Assange's extradition gathered outside the court, carrying placards reading \"Don't extradite Assange\".. The 50-year-old has been in prison since he was removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2019 and arrested by British police, after Ecuador withdrew his asylum status.. In May 2019, while serving a jail sentence in the UK for breaching bail, the US justice department filed 17 charges against Mr Assange for violating the Espionage Act - alleging that material obtained by Wikileaks endangered lives.. Mr Assange's legal team claimed that classified documents published by Wikileaks, which related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, exposed US wrongdoing and were in the public interest. .

        "content": "She is expected to stay in a cottage on the estate particularly liked by her late husband, Prince Philip.. A photograph has been released to mark the birthday, showing the Queen with two ponies and reflecting her lifelong interest in horses.. The picture was taken at Windsor Castle, where the Queen now mostly stays, and shows her with two Fell ponies, who will appear in the forthcoming Royal Windsor Horse Show.. Prince Harry suggested in a US TV interview that the Queen might be downplaying this latest milestone, saying that \"after a certain age you get bored of birthdays\".. But she will be spending time at Wood Farm, a cottage described as \"small and intimate\" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, and a place with strong associations with Prince Philip, who died a little over a year ago.. The Queen was in Sandringham earlier this year when she marked her accession to the throne in 1952.. She was born in 1926, not in a royal residence, but in a London townhouse on Bruton Street, where she first lived with her father and mother, who became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.. Birthday wishes have been sent by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and gun salutes will be fired.. The Queen has had mobility problems in recent months and has had to miss a number of events, including . .. Her only public appearance this year, outside of her own residences or on video, was at the Thanksgiving Service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey.. The Queen's 96th birthday marks another unprecedented age for a British monarch, in a year in which she has become the first monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne.. The next longest-lived monarchs were Queen Victoria and George III, who lived to the age of 81, and were the only other monarchs to have lived into their 80s.. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, the Queen is one of about 124,000 people in the 95 to 99 age group in the UK, almost three quarters of these being women..

        "content": "It did not take long for the two-hour-45-minute clash to burst into life.. The two candidates confronted each other on the cost of living, Russia, climate change and immigration.. Spiralling prices of energy and at the shops have dominated the campaign and immediately took centre stage in the debate, broadcast on the two biggest TV networks as well as the big news channels. . Emmanuel Macron was widely seen as the winner of the 2017 debate, when his rival appeared flustered and underprepared. But this time, Marine Le Pen was ready from the start and far more composed.. Throughout the debate, it was Mr Macron who went on the offensive, appearing more like a challenger than an incumbent, repeatedly interrupting his rival.. Ms Le Pen said 70% of the French people believed their standard of living had fallen over the past five years and she would be the president of civil peace and national brotherhood. \"We need to give priority to the French in their own country,\" she said.. Mr Macron said France had known unprecedented crisis, with Covid followed by war in Europe. He had steered France through those challenges and aimed to make France a stronger country: Sunday's vote was a \"referendum on Europe, on secularism, and a moment of clear choice\", he said.. After a relatively civil start, it quickly turned combative when the two candidates addressed the biggest issue for voters.. From the start Marine Le Pen said this was her priority: \"I will permanently cut VAT on energy. I will also cut taxes, no income tax for under-30s\". She accused Mr Macron on letting pension levels fall in real terms too. . Mr Macron said his solution was to impose a cap on prices which was \"twice as effective as dropping sales tax\". . They became animated as they disagreed on how to bring down energy prices. Mr Macron repeatedly challenged his opponent's proposals as unworkable. She snapped back: \"I want to give the French their money back.\". Emmanuel Macron said Russia was \"going down a fatal path\" and the role of France and Europe was to provide Ukraine with military equipment and take in refugees.. Ms Le Pen, criticised for her close ties to the Kremlin and for taking a Russian bank loan for her party, warned that giving Ukraine weapons could make France a \"co-belligerent\". However, she supported her opponent's policy of backing Ukraine and taking in refugees.. At this point Mr Macron went on the offensive, pointing out she was one of the first political leaders in 2014 to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. \"You're speaking to your banker when you speak to Russia,\" he said.. Ms Le Pen said she had taken Russian money as no French bank would lend to her party. When she argued that she had had to borrow money like millions of French people, he countered that the French did not look to Russia for finance.. Marine Le Pen has changed her policy from leaving the EU to seeking change from within it. But Mr Macron argued that her idea of a \"Europe of nations\" would spell the end of the EU and that \"you are selling a lie\".. In the current EU she said France was failing to defend its interests and she would stop negotiating trade deals that \"hurt French producers and farmers\".. This is another of the big election issues: Emmanuel Macron has said France needs to raise the pension age from 62 to 65 over nine years, while Ms Le Pen wants to keep it at 62.. Ms Le Pen said his proposal was \"absolutely intolerable\". He hit back saying she was promising to be more generous with pensioners but did not explain how she would pay for it. . Renewable energy is another issue where the two candidates are diametrically opposed and it became one of the most animated points of the debate. The only thing they agree on is building more nuclear power stations.. \"You are a climate sceptic, that's pretty obvious,\" Mr Macron said to his rival. The only Green presidential candidate has urged his voters to back the incumbent president. Marine Le Pen retorted that he was a \"climate hypocrite\".. However, Marine Le Pen claimed importing goods from thousands of miles away was responsible for climate change and producing locally would help tackle global warming. There was nothing worse than wind turbines, she complained. He countered that her policy of relying on nuclear power to replace fossil fuels was \"untenable\" and renewables had to be part of the mix. \"Wind turbines create jobs,\" he added.. While Emmanuel Macron spoke of France as the biggest country of start-ups in Europe, Marine Le Pen reminded him there were people watching \"who still have no broadband or internet coverage.\" . She said the tech sector had created mostly low-cost, precarious jobs and the only way to prosperity was industry, which was in decline. Mr Macron denied that was the case.. Marine Le Pen went on the offensive, promising a referendum on who should stay and who should leave France and condemning what she called \"anarchic and massive immigration\" that contributed to a sense of insecurity.. She then spoke about another of her key policies, banning the wearing of the headscarf in public, arguing that women had to be liberated from \"Islamist pressure\". Mr Macron objected it was wrong to mix Islam with Islamism. Her policy, he said, would lead to \"civil war\" and was a betrayal of French values: \"You would have police running down the street after girls in headscarves and [Jewish] boys wearing the kippah.\" It was intolerant and she was pushing millions of compatriots out of the public space on account of their religion, he said.. Another of Marine Le Pen's big policies is for citizens' referendums, which she said were rooted in the yellow-vest protests or . that began early in the Macron presidency. \"The main problem after your five-year term is that you have divided the country. We need to rebuild France and bring people together.\". One of the big attractions of such referendums for Ms Le Pen is that they would bypass parliament, where she has only a handful of MPs. Mr Macron said they would be unconstitutional.. Televised confrontations between the top two candidates have been a highlight of French presidential elections for almost five decades and they have proved most decisive when the polls are close.. In 1974, conservative Valéry Giscard d'Estaing went on to beat Socialist François Mitterrand after performing well in their debate. Mitterrand did better in the rematch in 1981 and won the run-off vote.. This was the first time since then that the same candidates have squared off in two consecutive elections. . The 2017 debate was a disaster for Ms Le Pen that led to a big election defeat. This time around the race is much closer and her strong performance could help win over undecided voters.. The gap in the opinion polls has widened slightly since the first round vote in which the incumbent president won 27.85% and Ms Le Pen came second with 23.15%. But they are still fluctuating wildly, suggesting Mr Macron will secure between 53% and 57% of the vote.. The choice for voters is far clearer than five years ago, when Emmanuel Macron won with very little experience as a politician. . His strict Covid policies alienated many voters and he has been accused of acting as a \"president for the rich\". He is more popular in the big cities but has secured the support of other mainstream left and right parties for his pro-EU liberal and global outlook.. Marine Le Pen has toned down her nationalist, anti-EU rhetoric during the campaign but as she made clear in the debate her aim remains to revise France's relationship with the European Union..

He is also one of the most high profile Russians to publicly condemn President Vladimir Putin's actions.. Two of the country's most prominent oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have made separate calls for peace, but have stopped short of direct criticism.. Mr Fridman, a billionaire banker, .  not just to himself but also staff and colleagues. . However, the businessman Boris Mints, who worked for the Russian government in the 1990s but was discharged of his political roles four days after Mr Putin took office, has joined Mr Tinkov in voicing direct criticism of the president.. Mr Mints, who lives in the UK, is the subject of current legal action by the Kremlin. He told the BBC \"every right-thinking person has a duty to speak out against this appalling war and Vladimir Putin's growing authoritarianism\".. \"All of us must do what we can to support Ukrainians suffering from this vicious onslaught, whether in Ukraine or as refugees beyond its borders,\" he added.. The UK government has sanctioned Mr Tinkov along with many other Russians identified as having close links to the Kremlim. Mr Mints has not been sanctioned.. Mr Tinkov has previously denied having any close relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin.. In his Instagram post, Mr Tinkov said 90% of Russians were against the war in Ukraine and added \"morons in any country are 10%\".. \"I don't see a SINGLE beneficiary of this insane war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,\" Mr Tinkov added.. \"Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army.. \"And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shitty and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?\". Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Mr Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (£3.4bn).. But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month.. Switching to English in his post, Mr Tinkov wrote: \"Dear 'collective West' please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre. Please be more rational and humanitarian.\". In a statement, Tinkoff Bank said it would not comment on the \"private opinion\" of its founder, who stepped down as chairman in 2020, saying he no longer made decisions for the brand started in 2006.. Mr Tinkov, who is not currently in Russia, owns about 35% of Cyprus-based TCS Group Holding, whose stable of companies under the Tinkoff brand span sectors from banking and insurance to mobile services.  . He has been described as a \"serial entrepreneur\" whose career has seen him go from bike racing, to importing electronics, flogging frozen food, brewing beer, issuing credit cards and then back to bike racing as owner of cycling's Tinkoff-Saxo team..

        "content": "Russia says a fire onboard caused ammunitions to explode and the vessel sank as it was being towed in a storm. Ukraine says it hit it with missiles.. The new images do not immediately back the claims of either side - but there is no sign of a storm at the time.. The images were allegedly taken on 14 April, a day after Ukraine claimed to have struck the warship.. The three-second video clip - likely taken from a rescue boat - shows the Moskva in the distance listing heavily on her port side. . A tug, likely a Russian Shakhter, is on its right.. Smoke can be seen billowing out of the ship, with a section of the freeboard heavily damaged. . Holes are also visible in other parts of the freeboard in one picture, suggesting the warship had taken in a substantial amount of water. . It also appears all of the vessel's lifeboats had been deployed.. Ukraine says it successfully struck the Moskva with two recently-introduced Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles last Wednesday. . Unnamed US officials have told US media they believe the Ukrainian version.. Russia alleges it was damaged after an explosion and subsequently sank because of \"stormy seas\". . The BBC showed the footage to three naval experts who agreed the damage appeared consistent with a missile attack, but disagreed over whether other causes were still possible.. Jonathan Bentham, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, concluded that the vessel in the images was certainly a Slava-class cruiser and \"probably\" the Moskva. . Mr Bentham said the visible damage sustained by the cruiser looked like it may have been caused by a Neptune missile attack, but stressed it was not possible to rule out other causes at this stage.. \"The smoke marks on the portside seem to be near the waterline. That might indicate sea-skimming missiles, which the Neptune missiles are reported to be,\" Mr Bentham said.. Another expert, Rear Admiral Chris Parry, who previously commanded a Royal Navy destroyer, told the BBC he was sure the damage was caused by a missile strike.. \"You can see a very jagged imploded ship's side,\" Rear Adm Parry said. \"If it was an internal explosion, you'd see plating sticking outwards rather than inwards. But this suggests penetration and subsequent explosion. No doubt it's been hit by one or two missiles.\". The former Nato commander said one explanation for the extensive smoke damage was that missiles being stored onboard became punctured in a strike and leaked their fuel the along the ship's decks, causing a devastating fire.. \"You can see the decks are completely buckled, the whole ship looks like it's burnt out. I think the fuel has run along the decks, even down the back end,\" he suggested.. Another military expert, Sidharth Kaushal of the Royal United Services Institute, noted to the BBC that the main area of fire damage is \"where the ammunition for the ship's anti-aircraft guns are\". . \"One working hypothesis is that a fire started by the initial strike cooked off the ammunition from the anti-aircraft guns,\" Kaushal said. . While conditions can vary at different times, there's nothing in the video to confirm the Kremlin's initial assertion that the Moskva sank due to stormy conditions.. Prior to the sinking, Russia's defence ministry issued a statement saying \"the vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated\". . The BBC has not been able to verify the claims.  . Russia has also not admitted any casualties. On Saturday, the Russian defence ministry published footage showing what it described as the crew of the Moskva on parade in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol.. The 510-crew warship had led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine, which made it an important symbolic and military target.. Earlier in the conflict the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - . . .

        "content": "They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said.. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. . The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians.. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city.. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. . However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated.. \"People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,\" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. . The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol.. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. . Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked \"our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever\".. He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by \"dozens of times,\" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces \"prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks\". . As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right.. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. . Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is \"basically another city\" beneath the plant.. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. . This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday.. Deputy Mayor Orlov warned that basic supplies at the plant have almost run out. . \"They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She said .  when he told her his unit had \"very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers\". . Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. . Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. . Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia.. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. . If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. . If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world.. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. . His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress.. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by \"Nazis\". .

        "content": "By contrast, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had earlier said Germany would end oil imports by the end of the year, with gas following.. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has . .. He described energy payments as \"blood money\".. Proceeds from the sale of Russian oil and gas amount to around $1bn (£770m) a day, undermining international efforts to put economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin to end the war.. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year.. But EU countries are more heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Germany currently buying around 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia.. Mr Lindner told the BBC that his country was working to implement an embargo on Russian energy but that he preferred using sanctions which \"hurt [Putin] more than us\".. He said a sudden halt to Russian energy imports could see the physical shutdown of German producers such as manufacturers and carmakers.. Earlier this week, German economic institutes warned that immediately halting Russian imports would spark a sharp recession in Europe's biggest economy by 2023.. \"We are willing to stop all energy imports from Russia, it's just a matter of time,\" said Mr Lindner, who is leader of the liberal Free Democrats, one constituent of Germany's coalition government.. He insisted that any calculation on Vladimir Putin's part that Germany would continue to rely on Russian energy was \"wrong\".. \"In the end, we don't want to have any further business with Putin,\" he said.. However his stance was at odds with statements made by Germany's foreign minister, Ms Baerbock, who is Green Party co-leader.. Ms Baerbock said Germany would halve Russian oil imports by the summer and eliminate them altogether by the end of the year, to be followed quickly by a reduction in Russian gas imports.. Germany's finance minister was keen to sound tough on Russia and appears acutely aware of the criticism levelled at his country for dragging its feet over a full energy embargo on the Kremlin.. His basic message was - it is coming, but not quite yet, because it is impossible to enact immediately and would probably lead to shutdowns of large swathes of the German economy. . President Zelensky used a BBC interview last week to demand an immediate embargo on Russia's lucrative oil trade, accusing those sending euros and dollars to Kremlin-controlled oil giants of \"trading in blood\". He singled out Germany alongside Hungary for blocking EU action. . Mr Lindner said Germany would move as fast as possible, but did not confirm that would be within a year. . In Berlin this issue appears to be putting some stress on the three-party governing coalition. Mr Lindner leads the free market FDP, not the normal bedfellows for the Social Democrats and Greens. . Meanwhile Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock, also the foreign minister, said dependence on Russian oil would definitely finish by the end of the year. The Chancellery under Olaf Scholz appears to be the most cautious on this issue.. Germany has already called off the opening of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to the war, a project pursued by previous governments of different political stripes.. But Mr Lindner said he was concerned about the macroeconomic effects an overnight shut-off of Russian energy would cause.. \"I don't fear [the] economic costs [of buying less Russian energy]. I fear the physical scenario, if you have to stop the supply, for a complete production line, this causes more than economic costs,\" Mr Lindner told the BBC. . \"I think it's preferable to have sanctions, which we can stand for months, for years,\" he said.. Mr Lindner said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the root cause of growing geopolitical and economic risks including inflation, food shortages and a debt crisis for low income countries. . But he also criticised the approach of previous Berlin governments of relying on Russia for oil and gas.. \"It was a strategic miscalculation from German governments, over the last two decades, and now we have to work on energy diversification,\" he said..

Sir David said that environmental success stories should give us hope that change is possible.. \"Fifty years ago, whales were on the very edge of extinction worldwide. Then people got together and now there are more whales in the sea than any living human being has ever seen,\" he suggested.. \"We know what the problems are and we know how to solve them. All we lack is unified action.\". UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that the UN chose to recognise Sir David because of his devotion to broadcasting the natural world.. \"If we stand a chance of averting climate and biodiversity breakdowns and cleaning up polluted ecosystems, it's because millions of us fell in love with the planet that he captured on film and writing, in his voice,\" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. . Sir David began working on natural history programmes in the 1950s, and his programmes filmed in far-flung parts of the world became immensely popular. In the past four years, his warnings about the damage that climate change is causing the planet and humans have become more stark.. Sir David is particularly popular with children and teenagers worried about climate change. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has said that .  and that everyone should strive to be like him. .

Benjamin, 13, said watching Sir David's programmes has inspired him to become a marine biologist. But they've also taught him about the danger we face from climate change and biodiversity loss.. \"I want to be able to have a family and I want them to live a nice world. But if we start trying very hard, we can save the natural world,\" he explained.. Sir David's emphasis on success stories like bringing back whales from the point of extinction is important, Prof Rick Stafford, marine biologist at Bournemouth university, told BBC News.. \"He really brought climate change and biodiversity loss to the forefront.

        "content": "Ukraine's best-trained forces were already posted in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses, but are still a significant challenge to Russia's invading army.. Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, but are still not in control of the port city of Mariupol. Ukraine's president has said \"we will fight for every metre of our land\" and Russia's new offensive could herald a protracted conflict.. When President Putin talks of Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border.. \"The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine,\" says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. . These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. \"Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension,\" says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka, head of Rochan Consulting..  region and 54% of Donetsk. Russia's president is still a long way from subduing the entire area, but even if he were to be able to claim victory, this is a very large territory to control.. The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. . When the war began, almost two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by Russian proxies, who created Moscow-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. . Just before the war, President Putin recognised all of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. . If Russia were to conquer both big regions, it would give Vladimir Putin some sort of achievement from Russia's war. The next step would then be to annexe Donbas, just like he did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014. . And if it came before 9 May, he would even be able to celebrate on Victory Day, when Russia's military still marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.. Russia's puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of having a referendum in the \"near future\", although the idea of even a sham vote in a war zone seems absurd.. Ukraine's military believes he wants full control not just of Donbas but also of the southern region of Kherson, to the north and west of Crimea. That would give him a land bridge along the south coast to the Russian border and control of the water supply to Crimea.. Much of Donetsk and key areas of Luhansk are still in Ukrainian hands, so Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east, moving in from the north, east and south. \"This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,\" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.. They have so far failed to capture Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv south of the Russian border, but they have seized control of Izyum - a strategic town further down the main motorway heading into the separatist-controlled east. . \"If you look at what they're doing around Izyum, it's following the main lines of the highways and that would make sense, given that they're moving most of their equipment by road and rail,\" says Prof German.. The towns now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since Russian-backed separatists first seized large parts of Donbas.. The next big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. Capturing Kramatorsk, just to the south, is also a big objective.. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says if Ukraine holds on to Slovyansk, Russia's campaign to seize both regions \"will likely fail\".. Russian forces have attacked a succession of Ukrainian-controlled towns in Luhansk as they advance from the north and east. They have entered Kreminna, to the north-west of Severodonetsk and have bombarded towns including Rubizhne, Popasna and Lysychansk.. These towns are important because controlling them would enable Russia to drive west and link up with Russian forces pushing south-east of Izyum, says the ISW. That is why Ukraine's military is concentrating its counterattacks in that area outside Izyum.. The Russians need to control the supply lines by road and block Ukrainian access to rail routes from the west. Rail is the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry and it is the fastest route out for fleeing civilians.. Controlling parts of the rail network would also enable Russian forces to move their troops and supplies.. Regional military administration head Serhiy Haidai believes Russia's goal is to destroy everything blocking their way in order to achieve Vladimir Putin's target of reaching Luhansk's western regional borders.. Maryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk, leaving her parents behind as Russian shells continued to fall. \"They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity.\". Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. \"It's far more scary to remain and burn in your sleep from a Russian shell,\" warned Mr Haidai.. Train lines have been cut to Izyum in the north and to Mariupol and Melitopol in the south. Services have been disrupted from Slovyansk and no trains have run from the nearby hub of Kramatorsk since a rocket attack killed 57 people as they waited to board trains.. At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. . \"We don't really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now,\" said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi, who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks.. \"The main goal for the Ukrainians is to inflict as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles,\" says Konrad Muzyka.. US officials say Russia now has 76 battalion tactical groups in the east, having added 11 to the area in recent days, and more being resupplied north of the border. They typically number 700 to 900 men.. Despite their reinforcements, there is widespread scepticism that Russian forces will achieve any breakthrough fast. ISW believes they may be able to wear down Ukrainian positions but likely at high cost, while Ukrainian military experts believe many of Russia's battalion groups are in poor condition.. Russian forces have already sustained high losses after seven weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. Their units are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas, many under duress, as well as the broader Russian army. . Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter, although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February. Far more have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainian-controlled territory.. One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution.. \"I'm scared - it's just scary,\" she said. Men of military age were required to join the local Russian proxy militia, so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding, she explained.. \"They're mobilising [men] on the streets, catching them. There are no men in the shops, in town, on the streets.\" As a result, all male-dominated businesses are shut, she said.. \"We're already Russia, although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport.\". Bill Bailey on Eurovision and the inspiration for his new show. Incredible new drama Life After Life. The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell. ",

The company said it disagreed with the findings and would appeal.. New Mexico Environment Department cabinet secretary James Kenney said: \"There were several management failures and more than sufficient evidence to suggest that if standard industry practices were followed, the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins and the serious injury to Joel Sousa would not have occurred.. \"Through our investigation, we determined that Rust Productions' failures were both serious and wilful.\".

        "content": "Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but its forces have now fully withdrawn from around the capital Kyiv and northern Ukraine to Belarus and Russia. . A large-scale Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine has begun after Russia refocused its efforts there, following its withdrawal from the north of Ukraine.. Russian officials have said that the focus of their forces is now the \"complete liberation\" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. . Russia has substantially increased its troop numbers in the Donbas region in recent weeks, with satellite imagery showing a build-up of forces on Ukraine's border and convoys of vehicles travelling towards the frontline.. While both sides are locked in combat along the 300-mile front, the Ukrainians have repelled \"numerous\" attempted advances, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) says, with Russia still being hampered by logistical challenges.. Ukraine claims to have retaken the town of Maryinka near Donetsk.. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia may be attempting to encircle Ukrainian forces from Izyum to Donetsk, but the \"haste\" with which the offensive was launched could jeopardise its success.. Russian forces will likely increase the scale of ground offensive operations in the coming days, analysts say.. Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. . Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March. . Ukrainian resistance is now restricted to the Azovstal metal works, where the final Ukrainians continue to hold out, having refused to surrender. Russian-backed fighters are reportedly trying to storm the sprawling industrial complex and have renewed calls for the resistance to lay down arms.. Russia has been accused of war crimes for its intense shelling of the city, with the local mayor saying more than 20,000 civilians have been killed.. To the west, Russia had been attempting to push towards Odesa, with the aim of cutting off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but their advances stalled at Mykolaiv.. The ISW believes that Ukrainian troops in the area may attempt to retake the city of Kherson in the coming weeks.. Russia abandoned a stalled push towards Kyiv, which had begun in the first days of its invasion, and withdrew its forces from the north of the country. . Successful counterattacks by Ukrainian forces helped retake areas around Kyiv and, as the Russians withdrew, the Ukrainians were able to advance all the way to their northern borders with Belarus and western Russia. . The Russian retreat has allowed a clearer picture to emerge of the huge amount of damage and destruction to lives and towns and villages seized during their push towards the capital, with allegations of war crimes committed by Russian troops. .
