        "content": "Mr Depp, 58, sued Ms Heard, 36, over a story she wrote in which she described herself as a victim of domestic violence. He denies any abuse.. Ms Heard filed a $100m counterclaim.. Taking the stand for a fourth day, Mr Depp responded to questions about a 2013 text exchange with British actor Paul Bettany. . \"Let's burn her,\" Mr Depp had wrote. \"Let's drown her before we burn her.\". He then made a further obscene suggestion \"to make sure she is dead\".. Asked about the messages in court, Mr Depp said the messages were \"directly\" from a Monty Python sketch about burning and drowning witches. . \"This is a film we'd all watch when we were 10 - it's just irreverent and abstract humour,\" he said. . This video can not be played. During cross-examination, Mr Depp was pressed on his claims that Ms Heard was wrong to portray him as a domestic abuser. . Jurors heard a series of audio recordings of conversations between the former couple, in which Mr Depp could be heard shouting vulgar insults and obscenities at Ms Heard. . In one exchange, Ms Heard shouts at Mr Depp to put his \"cigarettes out on someone else\". Mr Depp could be heard insulting Ms Heard about her weight.. He grimaced while the clips were played, while Ms Heard seemed to hold back tears.. And lawyers for Ms Heard focused again on Mr Depp's his history of substance use, claiming he would be violent during alcohol and drug binges. . But Mr Depp said: \"If anyone had a problem with my drinking, at any time in my life, it was me. The only person I've ever abused in my life is myself.\". At times, Mr Depp appeared visibly agitated by the lines of questioning, occasionally snapping at Ms Heard's lawyer, J Benjamin Rottenborn.. Mr Rottenborn introduced a series of negative articles about Mr Depp, some dating back to 2014, trying to demonstrate that damage to his reputation - and his career - had been done years before Ms Heard publicly accused Mr Depp of abuse. . \"These are all hit pieces. These are dreck [rubbish],\" Mr Depp said.. At the centre of the case is Ms Heard's 2018 opinion piece in the Washington Post, where she describes herself as a \"public figure representing domestic abuse\". . Mr Depp says the article - which does not mention him by name - is defamatory and derailed his career.. At the trial - now in its third week - lawyers for Mr Depp have claimed Ms Heard was the aggressor, playing the \"role\" of victim to benefit her career.. Earlier, the jury heard evidence presented by the celebrity ex-couple's former therapist, who described how Mr Depp and Ms Heard engaged in \"mutual abuse\", as well as from medical workers who treated Mr Depp as he was detoxing himself from opiates.. Several high profile witnesses, including the entrepreneur Elon Musk and the actors James Franco and Paul Bettany, are to appear later in the trial, which is expected to last at least another month..

        "content": "The Shiretoko Peninsula is a spectacular place. It sticks far out into the northern Pacific, covered in densely forested mountains with waterfalls that cascade off high cliffs straight into the ocean. . The northern half of the peninsula is a national park and world heritage site. It is also home to Japan's largest population of Ussuri brown bears, close relatives of the north American grizzly.  . Apart from the stunning natural beauty, it is the bears that tourists come to see. And the easiest way to see them is by boat. Some companies claim to have a 90-95% success rate in getting their customers a bear sighting.. At around 10am on Saturday morning the Kazu 1 tour boat headed out of the little fishing port of Utoro - heading up the peninsula. . The boat could hold 65 passengers but on Saturday only 24 tourists were aboard. They had come from all over Japan. There were two small children, one just three years old. . The weather was bad. There were strong winds and three-metre (nine-foot) waves. This should have been enough to turn the boat around. . As the Kazu 1 headed north into stormy seas, local fishing boats were heading in the other direction, returning to port to take shelter. . The skipper of another tour boat says he told the captain of the Kazu 1 it was too dangerous to go out. But he says he was ignored. . The captain of the Kazu 1 was inexperienced at skippering at sea. . According to Japanese media, he had been trained to operate lake boats but had been hired by the Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise company to replace more experienced skippers who had been \"let go\" by the owner.  . The company was already under investigation after two previous safety incidents, including a grounding, in 2021.    . At a little after 1pm on Saturday the coast guard received a distress call. The Kazu 1 was drifting with a broken engine and taking on water close to the Kashuni Falls. This is a particularly rugged piece of the peninsula, with few beaches, and cliffs plunging straight into the sea. . In April the water is still very cold, just a few degrees above freezing. . You might think that in Japan, where safety is almost a national motto, a passenger boat operating in frigid waters would be required to have life rafts on board. . But no. In-shore passenger vessels are not required to have rafts. . The Kazu 1 had only life vests and floats for passengers to hold on to. Plunged into the freezing waters off northern Hokkaido in April an average adult would survive no more than an hour, experts say. A child much less. . But rescue would not arrive within an hour, or even two. The first coastguard helicopter would not reach the Kashuni Falls until more three hours after the first distress call was received.  . The north-east coast of Hokkaido is known as a \"blind spot\" for rescue services. . The closest helicopter base is 160km (100 miles) away. But on Saturday the closest coastguard chopper was out on another operation. It had to fly back to its base, refuel, and then head north to Shiretoko. By the time it arrived there was only 90 minutes of daylight left. . At the time of writing there are 15 passengers and crew still missing. An intense search is continuing. . But any hope of finding anyone alive is now pretty much gone. The anger and the soul searching have begun. . Important questions need to be answered: Not the least of which is why was an inexperienced skipper allowed to put to sea in treacherous conditions with completely inadequate safety equipment for the freezing waters off northern Japan?  .

        "content": "He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts.. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.. \"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\" Mr Musk said . . . \"I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,\" he added. . \"Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\". The move comes as Twitter faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation on the platform.. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of \"incitement of violence\". . At the time Mr Musk observed: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.\". News of the takeover has been cheered by the right in the US, although Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform.. The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: \"No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms.\". On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an \"extraordinary development in the world of social media\". . \"It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate.\". Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself.. In 2018 US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40 million settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny.. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand \"pedo guy\" on the platform. . On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate.. \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,\" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced.. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. . Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.  . Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published.. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced. . But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm.. Mr Musk has said he doesn't \"care about the economics\" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance.. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. . The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook.. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was \"the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders\".. It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November.. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: \"I don't have confidence in management.\". Mr Agrawal told employees on Monday that the future of Twitter is uncertain.. \"Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,\" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. . Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake.. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted . Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. . He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. . The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. . The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning. . From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter. . He himself has said it's not about the \"economics\", this is about power and influence. . By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter. . He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy. . He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works. . The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now. . For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted. . Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation. . You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for. . The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly. . This video can not be played. The Olympic champion who turned his back on Putin.
