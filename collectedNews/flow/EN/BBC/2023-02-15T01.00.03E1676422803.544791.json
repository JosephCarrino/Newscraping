        "content": "Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October's explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea.. \"I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,\" Olesya tells the BBC, \"reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened.\" . She had also shared a friend's post about the war.. Then the drama began.. \"I was talking on the phone to my mother,\" Olesya recalls, \"when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor.\". Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison.. \"I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,\" Olesya says. \"I'd seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn't paid much attention and continued to speak out.\". A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia's official list of terrorists and extremists. . \"When I realised I'd been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,\" recalls Olesya. . Under the rules of her house arrest she's banned from talking on the phone and going online.. Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: \"Big Brother is watching you.\". It appears that in Olesya's case, it wasn't Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students.. \"A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,\" Olesya says, \"about how I was against the 'special military operation'. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities.\". The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat.. In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing \"provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud\". . \"First let's try to discredit her. If she doesn't get it, let the security services deal with it.\". \"Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,\" someone else writes.. Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat.. It's one year since the Kremlin launched its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate \"true patriots from scum and traitors\".. Since then, across Russia .  against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues. . Public criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people's criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don't support it, at the very least you're expected to stay silent. If you don't stay silent, there's a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading \"false information\" about the military and \"discrediting\" the army.. In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: \"Being a warrior means living forever.\" . The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments. . \"People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they're sick in the head,\" Konstantin tells me. \"They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder.\" . \"I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,\" Ekaterina tells me. . But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn't that harsh? I ask.. \"People should use their brains,\" Ekaterina replies. \"If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they're patriots, they need to abide by the law.\". Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement. . Olesya's T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with \"School Bus\" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities.. The judge rules to keep her under house arrest.. \"The state doesn't have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,\" Olesya says. \"But they can't put everyone in prison. At some point they'll run out of cells.\". ",

        "content": "Some 200 buildings were completely destroyed by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck nearby southern Turkey on 6 February.. The While Helmets say 517 bodies have been pulled from the rubble there, though another 813 injured survivors have been found alive.. The deaths represent almost a quarter of the total reported across the region, where 90% of the 4.6 million population were in need of humanitarian assistance even before the disaster. . Jindayris has also been the scene of several remarkable rescues carried out the White Helmets and the town's residents. . One dramatic video filmed hours after the earthquake showed . , still connected to her dead mother by her umbilical cord. Her father, four siblings and aunt also did not survive.. Drone footage of Jindayris posted by the White Helmets a week ago showed that such rescues were the result of hundreds of people searching through the rubble, often with just their bare hands.. However, the White Helmets have complained that their operations have been hampered by the failure of the UN and the international community to deliver any heavy machinery or other specialist equipment they requested. . The group's chief, Raed al-Salah, also warned on Tuesday that the search for survivors in the north-west was about to come to a close.. \"The indications we have are that there are not any [survivors], but we are trying to do our final checks and on all sites,\" he told Reuters news agency.. The outlook is similar in government-controlled areas, where the health ministry has reported 1,414 deaths.. The UN has said 7,400 buildings have been completely or partially destroyed across Syria, and that a total of 8.8 million people have been affected. . The earthquake hit as humanitarian needs were at their highest level since the country's civil war started almost 12 years ago. It also happened during the coldest period of the year and in the middle of a cholera outbreak.. ",
