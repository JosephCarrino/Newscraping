        "content": "Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors. The vessel broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. Migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran were on board.. A baby was among the dead, Italian officials said.. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who visited the scene, said as many as 30 people may still be missing. . Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region.. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\". . The exact number of people who were on the boat, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is not clear. . Rescue workers told the AFP news agency that the vessel had been carrying \"more than 200 people\", which would mean more than 60 people unaccounted for. . Many of the migrants were fleeing very difficult conditions, Italy's president said.. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif referenced reports that more than two dozen Pakistanis were among the dead, and called the news \"deeply concerning and worrisome\". He instructed Pakistan's diplomats to \"ascertain facts as early as possible\".. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea. . Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull.. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital. . \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cruto, Antonio Ceraso, told Rai News. . One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said.. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers.. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement. . \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\". Ms Meloni's right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy's shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues.. Carlo Calenda, Italy's former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\".. European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe.. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived. . According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.  . She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue. . \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes. .

        "content": "The Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft was struck by multiple blasts near the Machulishchy airbase.. It comes amid increased cooperation between Minsk and Moscow. . The strikes damaged front and central parts of the aircraft as well as its radar and antenna, BYPOL said on Telegram.. \"These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusian\", Mr Azarov said.. Speaking to the BBC, Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader, said the attack was \"creative\" and \"sophisticated\".. \"It was very brave because Belarusians are in a situation of the total terror\", he told BBC News. . He added that the opposition party was \"definitely helped by locals, helped by military\" to cause damage to the plane.. However, it is not possible to confirm the opposition's account of what happened. . Both the Russian and Belarusian departments of defence are yet to publicly comment on the incident. . BYPOL, the group that has claimed responsibility for the strike on the aircraft, consists of former law enforcement officers now opposed to President Alexander Lukashenko's office. . It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko's government. . While Belarus has not directly become involved in the war in Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to launch into Ukraine through Belarus.. The two countries have also been participating in joint military training exercises over recent months. . ",

        "content": "On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine's security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president's life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.. But Ukraine's leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as \"manipulation\" and called on everyone to remain calm.. Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. \"We expected it on 22 February,\" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia's initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did. . \"Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.\". If the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow's plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly?. A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region.. Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen.. Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: \"But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.\". The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine's general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia's invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine's defence.. Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed.. It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region. . As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river.. That indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned.. \"How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?\" Lt Palchenko explains. \"Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.\". Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv's defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure. . When Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. \"When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn't put together a map,\" he said.  . He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.  . They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko.. Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them. . \"My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.\"  . The Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge.. The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country's top military honour, Hero of Ukraine.. Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well.. \"[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,\" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. \"We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank 'hedgehogs' - in half a day, it was all done.\". Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko.. \"We stopped Russia's forces because the people rose up,\" he adds.. ",
