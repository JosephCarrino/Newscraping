A Russian government spokesperson deflected questions about the incident. . During a regular call with journalists, Dmitry Peskov told the BBC it was a matter for the defence ministry, which is yet to comment.. Moldova's country's defence ministry described the missile flyover as a \"violation\", and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation - having done the same following a similar incident in October.. The incident occurred on a day of political turbulence in Chisinau, during which the whole government resigned.. For its part, Romania insisted that Russian missiles had not strayed into its airspace \"at any time\".. But Mr Zelensky doubled down on the Ukrainian military's Romanian claim, writing that the Russian missiles posed questions for \"collective security\". . In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he added there were \"victims\" of the assault, without specifying a number.. The Ukrainian air force said 71 missiles were fired in Friday's \"massive\" attack, of which it shot down 61.. In the aftermath, an aide of Mr Zelensky reiterated a call for the West to donate fighter jets, and criticised \"political hesitation\" over the provision of new arms to his country.. Mr Zelensky himself had spent the previous day .  - following .  for the same purpose.. Ukraine is suffering blackouts after energy facilities were targeted in six regions.. Some 150,000 homes were without electricity in the eastern Kharkiv region alone, and seven people were injured, officials said. . Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, although the city's mayor said nobody was hurt. Residents sheltered in the capital's metro system, and school lessons were reportedly held in one station.. Other regions, including Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, also came under fire, and the governor of Mykolaiv region described at least three \"waves\" of missiles.. Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy facilities over the winter, and Ukraine's state energy firm described Friday's assault as the fourteenth of its kind. . Such attacks have been described by some analysts as war crimes, although Russia denies intentionally harming civilians. . Energy workers in the country have increasingly dangerous jobs - and 98 of them lost their lives while performing their duties last year, an official recently told Latvian media. . On Friday, the boss of Ukraine's state-owned rail network tweeted a defiant message . Olexander Kamyshin wrote: \"Trains will start delaying, but none will be cancelled. Promise.

Hopes of finding many more survivors are diminishing, amid freezing-cold weather four days after the disaster..

New-born Yagiz was pictured wrapped in a thermal blanket being carried to an ambulance to receive treatment.. His mother was brought out on a stretcher.

More than 21,000 people have died - most of them in Turkey - after Monday morning's initial 7.8-magnitude tremor and the hundreds of aftershocks that followed.. There have also been fears of a secondary catastrophe, as many people have been made homeless and are lacking shelter, water, fuel and electricity.. Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan has described it as the \"disaster of the century\".. Opposition figures have accused Mr Erdogan of failing to prepare for the earthquake and have questioned how estimated 88bn lira ($4.6bn; £3.8bn) raised from an \"earthquake tax\" was spent. The levy - first imposed in the wake of a massive quake in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people - was meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services. . Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party said on Wednesday that Mr Erdogan's government \"has not prepared for an earthquake for 20 years\". .

        "content": "\"It's terrible,\" Thando Makhubu, owner of Soweto Creamery, told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"When load-shedding is really, really bad, we find ourselves using our profit to run,\" Mr Makhubu said.. He even fears customers might stop coming to his creamery: \"We have had customers who assume that we are closed, because of load-shedding, so I am really worried that if load-shedding worsens, people won't come.\". His is just one of many businesses and households that have been affected by South Africa's energy shortage, which has even led to protests, with people declaring that . So the pressure has been mounting on President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the issue, which he said he would confront head-on: \"We must act to lessen the impact of the crisis on farmers, on small businesses, on our water infrastructure, on our transport network and a number of other areas and facilities that support our people's lives,\" he said in his state of the nation address on Thursday.. Before a clapping crowd, he announced: \"We are therefore declaring a national state of disaster to respond to the electricity crisis and its effect.\". President Ramaphosa outlined that the escalation of the crisis would allow the government to implement \"practical measures that we need to take to support businesses,\" he said, highlighting those in food production and retail supply chains.. \"It will also enable us to exempt critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants from load-shedding,\" he said, adding that it would allow the government to remove red tape for energy projects and so build them faster.. This crisis is nothing new, and has been . . The country's state-owned power company, Eskom, has $26bn (£21bn) of debt, old infrastructure, power stations that do not work properly, not to mention a recent strike which crippled the company.. However, the power shortage has escalated in recent months, with South Africans facing electricity cuts for 288 days last year, while this year there have been electricity blackouts for up to 15 hours a day.. A state of disaster effectively means that the government is given additional powers to resolve a crisis with less bureaucracy, regulation and extra funds.. A state of disaster was also implemented during the covid pandemic, and saw some people abusing the emergency measure.. In 2020, the country's then-auditor general said he uncovered .  of overfunding and potential fraud in the use of the Covid-19 relief fund, including some cases where personal protective equipment (PPE) was bought for five times more than the price the national treasury had advised. The government reacted by telling those accused of corruption to resign and cooperate with law enforcement.. However, the president anticipated potential corruption, and said measures will be put in place to prevent this. . But despite his attempts to address potential corruption, concerns still persist, with the chief whip of the opposition Democratic Alliance, telling the BBC that her party would be \"challenging this declaration\" because there should be \"targeted\" intervention towards Eskom instead of a general state of disaster.. \"[It] gives unfettered powers to the executive, the parliament has no oversight over the executive under some of those sections of the act,\" Siviwe Gwarube also told South Africa's News24. . \"And also more importantly, it allows government departments across the board to essentially subvert procurement processes as and when at will,\" she added.. There are also those who think the emergency measure will make no difference at all, and that the president hasn't taken decisive enough action.. \"What the country needs at this time was a deliberate and very decisive action plan with timelines, with targets and with a progress report,\" Dr Nthabiseng Moleko, a development economist from Stellenbosch Business School, told South Africa's SABC news channel. . \"It doesn't look like these solutions that we have are going to yield any outcome that is going to change the course and the path that this country is on,\" she added.. The appointment of a minister of electricity was also announced under the purview of assuming \"full responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the electricity crisis response\".. However, this new position has been mocked online, with some saying they would be clueless about how to solve the crisis and saying the country could soon end up with a minister of \"potholes\".. The president also outlined plans for the country to continue with its green energy transition programme, including through the \"roll-out of rooftop solar panels\".. South Africa relies on aging coal-fired power stations for most of its electricity - in 2020, just 7% of its energy came from renewable sources, according to the International Energy Agency. . ",

Nasyrova will be sentenced next month, and is facing up to 25 years in prison.. At the time, the pair looked quite similar, with dark hair and the same skin complexion, and they were both Russian speakers.. \"The jury saw through the deception and schemes of the defendant,\" Melinda Katz, the Queens District Attorney . .. \"Fortunately, her victim survived and the poison led right back to the culprit,\" Ms Katz added.. The jury heard that in August 2016, Nasyrova, now 47, went to her beautician's house in Queens with a box of cheesecake - eating two pieces herself, and offering the third, poisoned slice to Ms Tsvyk, who was 35 at the time. She started to vomit and went to lie down.. \"Before passing out, the woman's last memory was of seeing the defendant walking around her room,\" Ms Katz's statement said.. Ms Tsvyk's friend found her unconscious the next day, her clothes changed to lacey lingerie and pills scattered around the floor as if she had tried to take her own life.. When she finally returned home, Ms Tsvyk's Ukrainian passport and US work permit were missing, as well as jewellery and about $4,000 (£3,300) in cash, the prosecutor said during opening statements.. Phenazepam, a strong sedative, was detected in remnants of the cheesecake, and the pills scattered on the floor were also confirmed to be the same drug..

        "content": "At the time the market was shut, so no-one was hurt. But many stalls remain closed and there's only a handful of customers. Sandbags are stacked up outside some of the buildings. . In many parts of Russia this feels like a virtual war: a conflict being played out on television, far from home. But in Russia's Belgorod region war feels very real and very close. . Raisa Alexandrovna, who sells sweets here, has lost her sense of security. . \"No-one's protecting us,\" Raisa tells me. \"When people go home at night, they don't know if they'll still be in one piece in the morning.\". Everyone I speak to at the market tells me they live in fear of Ukrainian shelling. But they omit to mention that it was their country that invaded Ukraine. . They confirm that, one year, ago, life here was quiet and peaceful. Yet, they decline to join the dots and blame the Kremlin for what has transpired.. \"We had to start this military operation,\" Raisa insists. \"It's the right thing. We just should have been better prepared for it. We should have drafted people into the army right away. So many of our young men are dying. There'll be no one left for our women to marry.\". \"But what about the Ukrainians who've been killed because of Russia's invasion?\" I ask. . \"Yes, people on both sides have been killed,\" replies Raisa. \"But the minds of Ukrainians have been altered. A new generation has grown up there hating Russians. We need to re-educate them. Re-make them.\". In the city of Belgorod, the regional capital, a giant letter 'Z' - the symbol of Russia's military operation - has been erected along a busy highway. In recent months there have been explosions, too, in Belgorod, including at the airport, an oil depot and an apparent strike on a power plant. Suddenly residents are having to think about where to take cover. Shelters have been opened in cellars and in basements of apartment blocks.  . Conversations here run similar to those at the market, with most people telling me: yes, security only became a problem after the invasion, but, no, they don't blame the invasion itself. It's as if there's a psychological firewall preventing people from connecting the deteriorating security situation to the decision of their president.. If there is a firewall, patriotic messaging feeds it. . Staring down from billboards and advertising hoardings in Belgorod are the portraits of decorated Russian soldiers who've been fighting in Ukraine. The images and slogans encourage the public to rally round the flag.. \"Thank you for your heroic deeds!\" reads one poster.. \"For the Motherland!\" declares another. . \"Everything for the front line! Everything for victory!\". \"Believe in Yourself, but Live for Russia!\" . In addition to the slogans on the street, there's also the propaganda on Russian state TV. From morning till night news bulletins and talk shows assure viewers that Russia is in the right; that Ukraine and the West are the aggressors and that in this conflict the very future of Russia is at stake.. The messaging works. . In a Belgorod knitting shop, I get chatting to the owner. He clearly believes that, by criticising Russia, the West is pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.. \"The West plays a negative role,\" he tells me. \"It obviously wants to destroy Russia. We've seen that before. Under Adolf Hitler.\". Outside the shop, law student Ksenya agrees.. \"Ukraine is a Western puppet,\" Ksenya says, \"and the West has always wanted to destroy Russia. Hitler wanted to grab our land. Who doesn't? We have such an enormous country.\". Not everyone shares that view but few are willing to admit it in public.. \"I don't believe I can influence the situation,\" says Ivan, further up the street. \"I understand which country I'm living in and what the authorities have done to prevent ordinary people from expressing their opinions. Any such expression is dangerous.\" . References to Hitler are not accidental. You hear them all the time on Russian TV. To spark patriotic fervour and boost public support for the \"special military operation,\" the Kremlin paints the war in Ukraine in similar colours as World War Two: as Russia fighting fascism, battling to defend the Motherland from foreign invaders. . The reality is very different. In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In 2022 Vladimir Putin's Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. . In wasteland outside Belgorod I see first-hand how connections to World War Two are being created. A group of armed men have agreed to meet me. They call themselves \"Smersh\" (\"Death to Spies\") after a notorious counter-intelligence unit created by Joseph Stalin in World War Two. They will not reveal their faces - or their names - but will talk briefly about their activities.. \"At the moment we are training a territorial defence force for Belgorod region,\" one man says. \"Some of those in training have experience in fighting. Some are former police and ex-military. They will defend Belgorod region if there is an attack on Russia. As for us, we will carry out any task the commander-in-chief may give us, in any town, anywhere in the world.\". Among the men being trained is Evgeny Bakalo, a local writer and businessman. In Belgorod Evgeny has set up a support group for Ukrainians who've crossed into Russia to escape the war. Mr Bakalo's opinion of Ukraine chimes with the controversial views of President Putin.. \"We're one people,\" he tells me. \"Ukrainians are Russians. They've just forgotten about it.\" . A year of war and fierce Ukrainian resistance suggest the opposite: that now, more than at any other time in its post-Soviet history, the Ukrainian people value their sovereignty and independence and are determined not to be forced back into Moscow's orbit. . Meanwhile, Moscow continues to portray Ukrainian officials as neo-Nazis and Western governments as Nazi sympathisers: another reason for the Kremlin's frequent references to the 1940s. . Under President Putin, the national idea is constructed around World War Two - what most Russians refer to as the Great Patriotic War: both the Soviet Union's victory in that war, and the enormous human cost of that victory. It is a hugely emotive subject.. Olga, who runs a church choir in Belgorod, tells me she is \"very frightened\" when the city is being shelled. When I suggest to her that this wouldn't be happening if the \"special military operation\" hadn't started, her immediate reaction is to reference World War Two.. \"I return us to the Great Patriotic War,\" Olga tells me, \"which was a time of great sacrifice. There are always sacrifices being made. When our men go off to fight they know they may be killed.\". Olga's husband isn't at home. He's volunteered to fight in the \"special military operation\". She accepts the official view - the version of events that much of the world dismisses as the Kremlin's alternative reality.. \"Russia didn't provoke this war,\" Olga tells me. \"A Russian will give you the shirt off his back. Russia didn't attack Ukraine. Russians are peace-loving and generous.\". ",
