        "content": "Tennis star Elina Svitolina, Chelsea footballer Mykhailo Mudryk and others responded with \"Glory to the Heroes!\" in their video tribute.. It is a battle cry in Ukraine's army.. The saying became popular among ordinary Ukrainians after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It has seen a resurgence after Moscow's full-scale invasion launched last year.. In . , Ukrainian athletes representing several sports appear one-by-one saying \"Glory to the Heroes!\". It comes after a passionate call by President Volodymyr Zelensky.. \"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\" he said earlier this week.. Arsenal's Oleksandr Zinchenko and Taras Stepanenko, who plays for Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk feature in the video. Legendary former player and now coach Serhiy Rebrov is also shown.. Separately, Ukraine's boxing heavyweight world champion, Oleksandr Usyk, .  dedicated to the shot soldier, whose identity remains unclear.. \"Glory to Ukraine! - for these words you got a bullet,\" he reads. \"You're no more - but memory is eternal of you, fighter\".. The graphic video first emerged on social media on Monday.. In the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the POW is shot dead with automatic weapons.. On Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information. . However, there is some doubt over his identity, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else. . The alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.. The BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.. Ukraine's authorities have said the killing is \"another proof this war is genocidal\" and launched a criminal investigation, vowing to hunt down the perpetrators.. Russia has not publicly commented on the video.. Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes - including torture, rape and murder - since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion. Russia denies the allegations.. Last July, a video emerged that showed another captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.. There have also been accusations against Ukrainian forces, with Moscow accusing soldiers of executing a group of Russian prisoners in November.. A Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Protesters face tear gas and water cannons - as MPs brawl in parliament - over a \"Russian-style\" bill. Riot police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse the crowds outside the parliament building. . Some protesters were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags.. The government said 50 police officers were hurt and police gear was damaged. . Police arrested 66 people during Tuesday's action, including one of Georgia's opposition leaders, Zurab Japaridze, who was reportedly beaten. . There has been widespread international condemnation of the bill. It would require non-governmental and media organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as \"foreign agents\", or face hefty fines and possible imprisonment. . The opposition says the Russian-style law marks a shift towards authoritarianism and would damage Georgia's chances of joining the EU.  Further protests are taking place on Wednesday.. Hours earlier, police had warned protesters to disperse with a repeated message blaring through loudspeakers. Eventually, officers in riot gear cleared the Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament.. US state department spokesman Ned Price said the draft legislation would be a tremendous setback and \"would strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\".. The EU is currently considering Georgia's application for candidate status and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Russia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media. . \"The law is Russian as we all know... We don't want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency. . Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". But inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law.. On Monday, scuffles broke out at a committee hearing into the proposed legislation, with one pro-government MP slapping the leader of the largest opposition party. . Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday's vote as a \"dark day for Georgia's democracy\". . It added that parliament's advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia's clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\". . The two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People's Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party. . The group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). . Georgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency. . At a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy's statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\". . What most protesters and the country's opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia's long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia's population supports Georgia's European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country's constitution.. ",

        "content": "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Ukraine \"was absolutely not involved\".. Moscow questioned how the US could make assumptions without an investigation. . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the report a \"co-ordinated fake news media campaign\" and told the state news agency Ria-Novosti those who attacked the pipeline \"clearly... want to divert attention.\". Russia has blamed the West for the explosions and called on the UN Security Council to independently investigate them. . German investigators said on Wednesday they had searched a ship in January which was suspected of transporting the explosives used to sabotage the two gas pipelines. There was at this stage no evidence to suggest a foreign state was involved, they said.. Russian gas deliveries had been suspended before the blasts. Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in August last year, saying it needed maintenance. Nord Stream 2 had never been put into service. . The exact cause of the 26 September blasts that hit the natural gas pipelines is unknown, but it is widely believed they were attacked. . Nato and Western leaders have stopped short of directly accusing Russia of attacking its own pipelines, although the EU has previously said Russia uses its gas pipelines as a weapon against the West.. On Tuesday, . that new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group had carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. . Citing anonymous US officials, the report said there was no evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation.. The US newspaper reported that the officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or \"any details of the strength of the evidence it contains\".. It added: \"Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two.\". Responding to the New York Times report, Mr Podolyak added that Kyiv had no information about what had happened.. Meanwhile, German website Die Zeit reported that German authorities had made a breakthrough in their investigation into the cause of the attacks.. According to joint research by several German media organisations, the boat used to plant the explosives was a yacht hired from a firm based in Poland, which reportedly belonged to two Ukrainians. The nationalities of those who carried out the attack were unclear. . German investigators later refused to confirm details of the report but said that a ship had been searched seven weeks ago.. Defence Minister Boris Pistorius warned against jumping to conclusions. It could be a false-flag operation aimed at pinning the blame on pro-Ukrainian groups, he told German radio: \"The likelihood of one [theory] or the other is just as high.\". At least 50m (164ft) of the underwater Nord Stream 1 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany is thought to have been destroyed by September's blast.. Danish police believe \"powerful explosions\" blew four holes in the pipe and its newer twin, Nord Stream 2.. German, Danish and Swedish authorities have all been investigating the incident. . Mr Peskov said Nord Stream shareholder countries should insist on an urgent, transparent investigation.. \"We are still not allowed in the investigation,\" he said. \"Only a few days ago we received notes to that effect from the Danes and Swedes. This whole thing is not just weird. It reeks of a heinous crime.\". For decades, Russia supplied huge amounts of natural gas to Western Europe.

Dominion argues in its lawsuit that top executives and some hosts at the conservative cable network knew that the conspiracy claims pushed by Donald Trump and his allies on Fox News programmes were false but still put them on air. . Previous filings have revealed that even Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire owner of Fox News, acknowledged some of the network's stars endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.. In a statement provided to the BBC's US partner CBS News on Tuesday night, Fox News said: \"Thanks to today's filings, Dominion has been caught red-handed again using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press.\" . A jury trial is expected to begin in Delaware in April.. The text message revelations come amid a fresh round of criticism that Mr Carlson misrepresented exclusive security-camera footage given to Fox to downplay the severity of the riot two years ago at Congress.. Mr Carlson showed the previously unseen clips on Monday night and argued it \"does not show an insurrection or a riot in progress\", but rather \"mostly peaceful chaos\". . Criticism of the segment came from Democrats . , the head of Capitol police, and the family of the police officer whose death was mentioned by Mr Carlson on the show. . ",
