        "content": "Watch: Video appears to show Hamburg suspect firing weapon. He co-operated with officers and there were not enough grounds to take away his gun at the time, police said.. The 35-year-old suspect, named only as Philipp F, had a licence to own the weapon for sporting purposes.. The country is preparing a new law involving tighter curbs on gun ownership, the interior minister said.. Seven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in Thursday's attack which unfolded at a Jehovah's Witness meeting hall in the city.. The first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) to report that shots had been fired, and officers were on site four minutes later.. Video appeared to show the gunman firing through a window. He then stormed the building where dozens of people had gathered, firing nine magazines of ammunition before apparently turning the gun on himself after police arrived.. Eight people were injured, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. She survived but her unborn baby was killed. . Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the death toll could rise.. German Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers saved many lives. He described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history.. Officials said the suspect had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member before leaving \"on bad terms\". . Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century.. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members.. On Friday, Hamburg Police Chief Ralf Martin Meyer said officers visited the man in February after they received an anonymous letter claiming he \"bore particular anger toward religious believers, in particular toward Jehovah's Witnesses\".. The letter also said he \"might be suffering from a mental illness, although it had not been medically diagnosed\". . Police said he was co-operative and had an open conversation with the officers. \"The bottom line is that an anonymous tip in which someone says they're worried a person might have a psychological illness, isn't in itself a basis for [such] measures,\" Chief Meyer said.. Forensic experts worked at the scene of the shooting on Deelböge street through the night but have since left the area. . Mourners have left floral tributes near to the front door. One man, holding his little boy and girl by the hand, told the BBC he tried to come home last night but his way was blocked by police wielding assault rifles.. Germany already has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a licence.. In 2021, there were about one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters.. After mass arrests were made last December . , the German authorities have been under pressure to tighten the country's gun laws even further.. ",

After last month's disaster, Italy's far-right government was accused of not doing enough to prevent the loss of lives.. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni responded by taking her cabinet to the site of the wreck in the town of Cutro. . She has proposed prison terms of up to 30 years for people smugglers responsible for deaths and serious injuries.. Italy has seen an increase of migrants arriving by sea this year. It has recorded three times as many arrivals as during the same period last year, according to its interior ministry. . ",

        "content": "Inviting him to a grand jury indicates he could face charges, experts say. . Ms Daniels says she got $130,000 before the 2016 election in exchange for silence about an alleged affair. . Mr Trump denies they had sexual relations.. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue charges in a case. It is held in secret, and several former aides of Mr Trump have reportedly testified in this case.. If prosecutors proceed, it could be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. The New York Times was the .  Mr Trump had been invited to testify to the grand jury.. If the Manhattan district attorney's office has asked Mr Trump to appear, that indicates the office may be considering indicting the former president, Catherine Christian, a former financial prosecutor in District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, told the BBC. . Mr Trump, she said, is unlikely to accept the opportunity to testify.. \"Most people decline for a host of reasons. You waive immunity, you open yourself up, if you lie, to perjury charges,\" she said. \"You're also letting the district attorney know what your defence is.\". The Stormy Daniels case is one of several cases in which Mr Trump is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. They come as the 76-year-old Republican embarks on another campaign for the White House.. Prosecutors have not commented on news of the invitation, reported in US media and confirmed by Mr Trump's legal team.. The case stems from an allegation that Mr Trump directed his former lawyer to pay Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, to stop her speaking out about an alleged affair.. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, was later jailed on multiple charges. Cohen testified under oath that Mr Trump had directed him to make the payment of $130,000 (£110,000) just days before the 2016 election. . Mr Trump has acknowledged reimbursing the payment but denied the affair and any wrongdoing regarding campaign laws. . The former president could face two charges for his actions, Ms Christian said. . The first, she said, could be a straight-forward misdemeanour charge for falsifying business records, as prosecutors allege he listed reimbursements he made to Cohen as legal fees.. The district attorney's office may also seek to charge Mr Trump with a low-level felony, but that presents a much more complicated legal case, she said. . The felony charge would be brought against Mr Trump for falsifying business records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime. . Prosecutors could argue Mr Trump's efforts to hide his payments to Ms Daniels were election campaign related, as he allegedly did so to keep voters from knowing he had engaged in an \"illicit relationship\" with Ms Daniels, Ms Christian said - something she called  \"a novel theory\".. \"That doesn't mean they can't prove it and get a conviction, but it's going to be tough.\". If convicted, Ms Christian said Mr Trump could face probation or a fine. . \"But it would still be a felony, and who wants to be charged with a felony, and who wants to convicted of a felony? Certainly not a former president,\" she said. . On his social media network Truth Social, Mr Trump himself called the investigation a political witch-hunt by what he described as a \"corrupt, depraved, and weaponised justice system\". . Prior to a meeting with the Manhattan DA on Friday, Cohen told media he \"applauded\" Mr Bragg for \"giving Donald the opportunity to come in to tell his story\".  . \"Now, knowing Donald as well as I do understand that he doesn't tell the truth,\" Cohen told the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"It's one thing to turn around and to lie on your untruth social. It's another thing to turn around and lie before a grand jury.\". Legal wrangling over the allegations about Ms Daniels were ongoing throughout the Trump presidency. . A federal inquiry into the Stormy Daniels case was dropped in 2021 after he left office but Manhattan District Attorney's Office has been running a separate investigation since 2018..

        "content": "Its troubles prompted a rush of customer withdrawals and sparked fears about the state of the banking sector.. Officials said they acted to \"protect insured depositors\".. Silicon Valley Bank faced \"inadequate liquidity and insolvency\", banking regulators in California, where the firm has its headquarters, said as they . .. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which typically protects deposits up to $250,000, .  it had taken charge of the roughly $175bn (£145bn) in deposits held at the bank, the 16th largest in the US. . Bank offices would reopen and clients with insured deposits would have access to funds \"no later than Monday morning\", it said, adding that money raised from selling the bank's assets would go to uninsured depositors.. With many of the firm's customers in that position, the situation has left many companies with money tied up at the bank worried about their future. . \"I'm on my way to the branch to find my money right now. Tried to transfer it out yesterday didn't work. You know those moments where you might be really screwed but you're not sure? This is one of those moments,\" one start-up founder told the BBC.. Another founder of a healthcare start-up said: \"Literally three days ago, we just hit a million dollars in our bank account... And then this happens.\". He managed to get the money wired to a different account 40 minutes before the deadline. \"It was pending. And then this morning, it was there. But I know other people who did the same thing minutes after me, and it's not transferred.\". \"It was a crazy situation,\" he said.. The collapse came after SVB said it was trying to raise $2.25bn (£1.9bn) to plug a loss caused by the sale of assets, mainly US government bonds, which had been affected by higher interest rates.. The news caused investors and customers to flee the bank. Shares saw their biggest one-day drop on record on Thursday, plunging more than 60% and fell further in after-hours sales before trading was halted.. Concerns that other banks could face similar problems led to widespread selling of bank shares globally on Thursday and early Friday.. Speaking in Washington on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was monitoring \"recent developments\" at Silicon Valley Bank and others \"very carefully\".   . SVB did not respond to a request for comment.. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses, the company is the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm, which started as a California bank in 1983, expanded rapidly over the last decade. It now employs more than 8,500 people globally, though most of its operations are in the US. . It has tried to assure customers of its stability in recent days. . On Friday, its UK subsidiary said it was independent, with a separate balance sheet that is \"ring-fenced from the parent and its other subsidiaries\".. \"We appreciate that this is a concerning time for our clients so we are working tirelessly to support them and give more context,\"  said its EMEA boss Erin Platts.. As well as being a major blow to the tech industry, the collapse of SVB has raised concerns about the wider risks facing banks, as rapid increases in interest rates hit bond markets. . Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - have sharply raised borrowing costs over the last year as they try to curb inflation. . But as rates rise, the value of existing bond portfolios typically declines.. Those falls mean many banks are sitting on significant potential losses - though the change in value would not typically be a problem unless other pressures force the firms to sell the holdings. . Shares in some major US banks recovered on Friday, but the sell-off continued to hit some smaller firms.. Alexander Yokum, equity research analyst at CFRA, said banks that specialise in single industries are seen as vulnerable to rapid withdrawals, like the one that hit SVB.. \"Silicon Valley Bank would not have lost money if they hadn't run out of cash to give back to their customers,\" he said. \"The issue was that people wanted money and they didn't have it - they had it invested and those investments were down.\". \"I know there's a lot of fear, but it's definitely company-specific,\" he said..
