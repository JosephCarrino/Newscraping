        "content": "Watch: Murdaugh's defiant last words as judge calls him a \"monster\". The hearing in South Carolina came one day after a jury took less than three hours to convict the 54-year-old. . Murdaugh's wife, Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22, were shot at close range on their family estate on 7 June 2021.. Prosecutors argued he killed his wife and son to divert attention from his financial crimes and gain sympathy.. Judge Clifton Newman called the case \"one of the most troubling\" he had seen and noted Murdaugh's past \"as a well-known member of the legal community\".. \"You've practised law before me, and we've seen each other at various occasions throughout the years,\" he said, calling it \"especially heart-breaking for me\" to learn of Murdaugh's arrest and prosecution, more than a year after the murders were committed. . Alex Murdaugh headed a legal dynasty that for decades had occupied a powerful place - the jurisdiction was described by some as \"Murdaugh Country\".. Judge Newman said he understood the decision by the state not to seek the death penalty, but noted that Murdaugh's own family had had people executed for less.  . \"Your family, including you, have been prosecuting people here in this courtroom, and many have received the death penalty, probably for lesser conduct,\" he said.. The disbarred attorney was convicted of two counts of murder after a six-week trial.. During the trial, investigators revealed how Murdaugh stole nearly $9m from clients, to fund an addiction to painkillers and a lavish lifestyle. . At Friday's sentencing, Murdaugh spoke briefly twice, to maintain his innocence. His lawyers said they would appeal against the life terms within 10 days. . Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, dressed in a simple navy-blue blazer, sat still and silent throughout the proceedings - even as the judge sentenced his father to two consecutive life sentences.. The judge also suggested the murders may have been carried out under the influence of the drugs.. \"It might not have been you, but it may have been the monster you became when you took those pills.\". This video can not be played. Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said the evidence against the South Carolina lawyer was \"overwhelming\" and showed him to be a \"cunning, manipulative man who placed himself above all others, including his family\".. Murdaugh, meanwhile, restated his claim that he was not guilty.. \"I would never hurt my wife and I would never hurt my son,\" he said in brief remarks at the hearing. He stared ahead and did not react as his sentence was read. . A video filmed by Paul Murdaugh just minutes before he was shot featured the voice of his father in the background, dramatically contradicting his claim he was not there at the time.. A juror who convicted him told ABC News that was the moment he began to suspect the defendant was guilty.. During a news conference after the sentence was handed down, Murdaugh's lawyers said they did not believe it was a mistake for him to take the stand during the trial. They called Judge Newman's decision to allow evidence related to Murdaugh's financial crimes to be included in the murder trial \"erroneous\". . The state's case \"was about character, not about motive\", defence attorney Dick Harpootlian said. Murdaugh had been cast as a \"despicable human being\", he said.. The high-profile case has captured national attention and sparked true crime podcasts and documentaries.. ",

Mr Bialiatski was one of three winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.. He was arrested in 2021 following .  the previous year, and accused of smuggling cash into Belarus to fund opposition activity.. Demonstrators were met with police brutality and Lukashenko critics .  during the demonstrations, which started in 2020.. Mr Bialiatski was in court alongside two fellow campaigners, Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich. . Mr Stefanovich was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Mr Labkovich received seven years, according to Viasna, the group Mr Bialiatski founded in 1996. . All three had pleaded not guilty. . Mr Bialiatski's wife, Natalya Pinchuk, said the trial was \"obviously against human rights defenders for their human rights work\", describing it as a \"cruel\" verdict. . Referring to her husband's letters from prison, where he has been held since arrest, she said: \"He always writes that everything is fine. He doesn't complain about his health - he tries not to upset me.\" . Kostya Staradubets, a spokesperson for Viasna, said the sentences imposed on the three activists were \"breaking our hearts\". . Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, he said: \"We knew that our three colleagues would get long prison terms but anyway it's still a shock, it's breaking our hearts, not only the [prison] terms are long but the conditions also very horrific.. \"We call [the conditions] torture actually because they're being held for several months in a 19th Century building, poorly lit cells with no fresh air, no sunlight, poor food, little or no healthcare.\" . Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said the sentencing was \"simply appalling\". . \"We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice and free them,\" she said. . Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize, said the verdict was a \"tragedy\" for Mr Bialiatski and described the charges as \"politically motivated\".. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned what he described as \"sham trials\", adding they were \"yet another appalling example of the Lukashenko regime trying to silence those who stand up in defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people in Belarus\". . There are currently 1,458 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna. Authorities claim there are none. . In awarding the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to Mr Bialiatski, Ms Reiss-Anderson said the Belarusian government had \"for years tried to silence him\". . \"He has been harassed, he has been arrested and jailed, and he has been deprived of employment,\" she said. . Mr Bialiatski is a veteran of the human rights movement in Belarus, establishing Viasna in 1996 in response to the brutal crackdown of street protests that year by Mr Lukashenko, who has been president of Belarus since the office was established in 1994. .
