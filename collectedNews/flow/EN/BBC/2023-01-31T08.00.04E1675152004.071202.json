        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. .

The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. .

Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",
