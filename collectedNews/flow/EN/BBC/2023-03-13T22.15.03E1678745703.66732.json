        "content": "The US is trying to stop people taking out funds from banks after SVB collapsed amid a rush of withdrawals.. Americans should \"rest assured that our banking system is safe\", Mr Biden said.. People and businesses who have money deposited with SVB - the country's 16th largest bank - would be able to access all their cash from Monday, he said.. Taxpayers will not bear any losses from the move, which extends protection beyond the $250,000 (Â£205,000) in deposits typically insured by the government. The cost will instead be funded by fees regulators charge to banks.. \"Let me also assure you we will not stop at this. We'll do whatever is needed,\" Mr Biden said.. SVB - which specialised in lending to technology companies - was shut down by regulators on Friday. It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. It came after SVB had scrambled to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates. Word of the troubles led customers to race to withdraw funds, leading to a cash crisis.. Authorities on Sunday also took over Signature Bank of New York, which had many clients involved in crypto and was seen as the institution most vulnerable to a similar bank run after SVB.. As part of their moves to restore confidence, US regulators unveiled a new way to give banks access to emergency funds, making it easier for banks to borrow from it in a crisis.. But there is concern that the failures, which came after the collapse of another bank, Silvergate Bank, last week, are a sign of troubles at other firms. . US financial markets were roughly flat in early trading on Monday, but shares of many banks were under pressure.. Shares in First Republic bank, which is based in San Francisco, plunged roughly 70% before trading was halted. . Elsewhere, . , while authorities in Canada took temporary control of the assets of SVB's branch in the country. . Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. The US measures have re-ignited debates - similar to those seen following the 2008 financial crisis - about how much the government should do to regulate and protect banks.. Mr Biden called for tougher rules and emphasised that investors and bank leaders would not be spared.. \"They knowingly took a risk... that's how capitalism works,\" he said.. Still, Republican Senator Tim Scott, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, called the rescue \"problematic\".. \"Building a culture of government intervention does nothing to stop future institutions from relying on the government to swoop in after taking excessive risks,\" he said.. Once again people are worried about banks. Once again there is intense debate about bailouts. But this isn't 2008.. Following the global financial crisis, the focus was on reforming banks considered \"too big to fail\". Today's problems are centred around medium- and smaller-sized banks.  . Both of the banks that collapsed - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - had the same thing in common: their business models were too concentrated in one sector and they were over exposed to assets whose values came under pressure from rising interest rates. . The criticism is that they should have foreseen this and they didn't. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has gone to great lengths to signal the Fed's intention to raise interest rates.. Since most banks are well diversified and have plenty of cash on hand, the assumption is that the risk to the rest of the banking sector is low. That won't stop regulators looking into what went wrong and what rules need to change. . And the pressure on small- and medium-sized banks hasn't gone away. What happens to the US economy and the fight against inflation also remains to be seen.. SVB started as a California bank in 1983 and expanded rapidly as the tech sector boomed. A crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the industry, it was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. The firm came under pressure last year, as its customers increasingly drew on deposits, because higher interest rates were making it more difficult to bring in new money through private fundraising or share sales.. That forced the firm to sell a large portfolio of assets, mostly of US Treasuries, at a loss - news that prompted client withdrawals to accelerate, while raising fears that other banks with large sums of money tied up in bonds could face similar losses.. Central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England - have raised interest rates sharply as they fight to stabilise rising prices.. Those moves have reduced demand for bonds with lower yields, which creates a problem for owners, like SVB, if circumstances force a sale.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse were widespread as companies, many of which had unsecured deposits, faced questions about what it meant for their finances.. Ben Kaufman, chief executive of toy retailer Camp, said his firm, which kept about 85% of its cash at SVB, was unable to transfer funds last week as panic swirled around the bank. . In response, he put out a plea to customers to buy at a discount, ultimately selling more than 100,000 products in 48 hours - as much business as Camp typically does in a month.. \"We knew that this would resolve itself somehow but we knew we needed that short-term liquidity and our customers provided it for us,\" he told the BBC.. The government's guarantee for unsecured deposits had been \"very helpful\", he added. . \"I'm not an economist so I don't know the ramifications of this but I know that as a business operator we rely on the cash that we have in the bank.\".

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Ukrainian commanders, who have committed significant resources to defending the city, say their strategy aims to tie Russia's forces down and prevent Moscow from launching any further offensives in the coming months. . \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was attacking his troops from several directions in a bid to break through defences and advance to the central districts of the town.. The paramilitary organisation is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. And on  Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . There were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut before the invasion, but only a few thousand remain. The city was once best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Those who remain in the city risk a hazardous existence, with four people injured in Bakhmut on Monday, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. A draft law introduced in the Russian parliament on Monday aims to push back the age bracket for compulsory military service, from the current 18-27 years to 21-30. . Reuters reported that, due to the transition period between the old legislation and the new, 2024 and 2025 would see the conscription age span 10 or 11 years rather than the usual nine - meaning more men would be eligible to fight. . Russia's previous attempt to draft thousands of new recruits into the Ukraine war met with some resistance. In September the announcement of a partial military mobilisation saw .  as men of draft age sought to flee the call-up. . The Kremlin said reports of fighting-age men fleeing had been exaggerated.. Besides the Bakhmut fighting, seven residents were injured elsewhere in Donetsk region on Monday, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said.. Further east in Luhansk, regional governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russians had \"significantly intensified shelling\" on the front line. He added that Russia was bringing more and more equipment and troops to the area.. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, there were 47 attacks on Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia, according to the regional administration.. ",
