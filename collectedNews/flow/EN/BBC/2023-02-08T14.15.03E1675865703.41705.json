        "content": "He commanded an anti-drone unit in occupied Luhansk, but had also been one of the founders of a mercenary group fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014. . He took to a stage last summer holding a man's skull.. In a video posted on social media in August, Mangushev was filmed saying the skull belonged to a Ukrainian fighter killed defending the Azovstal steel works in the southern port of Mariupol.. An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an \"anti-Russian state\", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died. . Mangushev emerged from a neo-Nazi movement to co-found private mercenary group Yenot (raccoon). . He was later known to have collaborated with Russia's most notorious mercenary boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a political strategist. . The shooting has prompted widespread speculation about who might have carried out the attack at a checkpoint in the occupied Ukrainian town of Kadiivka, some distance from the frontline.. Russian reports said he had been shot at close range with a 9mm bullet fired from the top of his head at an angle of 45 degrees. Russian authorities are investigating the killing and have so far said nothing about the circumstances.. The bullet had reportedly lodged in his brain. Before he died, pictures showed him lying in a hospital bed.. Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.. The 11-month war in Ukraine has energised the murky world of extremists in Russia and sparked rivalries between them.. After the attack, Russia expert Mark Galeotti said it demonstrated that Russia was sliding back towards aspects of the 1990s, \"when murder was a business tactic, and the lines between politics, business, crime and war became near-meaningless\"..

The packages were strung up with buoys and some labelled with a Batman symbol.. Pictures released by New Zealand police and defence officials also showed cocaine packets labelled with a black four-leaf clover symbol.. These were the \"trademark logos\" for the drug producers, believed to be in South America, said New Zealand officials.. \"This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealand agencies, by some margin,\" said New Zealand's police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday.. \"It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,\" he added.. New Zealand's navy deployed a vessel to retrieve the massive shipment last week, which comprised 81 bales of cocaine.. They were brought to Auckland in New Zealand's North Island on Tuesday and taken to a security facility to be documented and destroyed, officials said. . \"We believe we have dealt a significant blow to an international criminal syndicate's operation,\" Mr Coster said.. Authorities did not disclose details of the operation or how they found the drugs. But they said their partners in the Five Eyes intelligence group - which includes Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US - had provided assistance.. ",

        "content": "Prosecutors said there is evidence that Mr Putin decided to provide the missile to Moscow-backed separatists.. There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down.. In November, a Dutch court found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17.. The prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings.. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries.. In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said the court ruled that Moscow had \"overall control\" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014. . It cited recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said that the decision to provide military support \"rests with the President\".. \"There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,\" it said. . But it adds that is not known whether the request \"explicitly mentions\" the system used to shoot down MH17.. \"Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,\" investigators said.. \"Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State.\".
