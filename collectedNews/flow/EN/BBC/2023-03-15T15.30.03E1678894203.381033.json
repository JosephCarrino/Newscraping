        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. On Tuesday, officers in riot gear fired tear gas shells and water cannon to disperse hundreds of angry supporters of Mr Khan at the compound. Some of the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. He has said he did not appear because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . Mr Khan earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "US drone crash inevitable, Ukraine minister tells BBC. The large, MQ-9 Reaper drone . . The US and Russia have conflicting explanations.. The US said it .  after it became \"unflyable\" when a Russian jet clipped its propeller.. But Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he did not expect any diplomatic escalation.. Describing it as a \"routine incident\", Mr Kuleba told the BBC: \"As long as Russia controls Crimea, these kinds of incidents will be inevitable and the Black Sea will not be a safe place. . \"So the only way to prevent such incidents is actually to kick Russia out of Crimea.\". The key question is whether the encounter was an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . US military officials said the incident happened on Tuesday morning and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", the US said in a statement on Tuesday. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact with the US drone.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of nearby Crimea in 2014.. And since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US and the UK have stepped up surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The BBC asked Mr Kuleba if, following the drone incident, the US and other allies might become more cautious.. \"If the West wants to demonstrate its weakness, it should certainly demonstrate its cautiousness after an incident like this, but I don't have a feeling that this is the mood in capitals,\" he replied.. \"The mood is not to escalate but nor is the mood to lean under the pressure - the physical or rhetorical pressure - of Russia.\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin vowed the military would \"continue to fly and operate\" wherever international law allows.. He told the Ukraine contact group: \"It is incumbent upon Russia to operate its aircraft in a safe and professional manner.\". After being summoned to speak to officials in Washington, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov said Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. From the Kremlin's point of view Mr Antonov added: \"The unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern.\". On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reporters there has been no high-level contact between Moscow and Washington over the incident.. But he said Russia would never refuse to engage in constructive dialogue.. ",

        "content": "He is understood to have spent 22 consecutive days in isolation.. Queensland's human rights chief says the case may have broken state laws. . Jack was being held on remand on charges relating to a fight with another 13-year-old boy, at the detention centre some 1,300km north of Brisbane.. He flooded his cell with water from the toilet in desperation at his situation, and after being denied drinking water, his barrister Tim Grau told the BBC.. Describing his detention as \"extraordinary and cruel\", Mr Grau said Jack had \"no serious criminal history\".. \"He was 13, he'd been in court once before. So even for this offending, he was never going to get a period of incarceration, in my view,\" he said.. Mr Grau said he didn't know why Jack spent so long in isolation, but suspected it was due to staff shortages at the prison. . \"If he's being locked in because there's staff shortages, and Cleveland detention centre has 80 or more kids in at any one time, one can only assume that other kids are in the same circumstance. . \"You would hope not, but maybe it's more common than we thought.\". Jack's period of detention included six days being held in adult prisons. He was released last week with a verbal reprimand.. A separate recent case also raised human rights concerns over the Queensland's youth justice system, which is currently undergoing reform. . In February, it emerged that another 13-year-old Queensland boy with developmental disabilities spent 78 days confined to a cell for 20 hours per day.. Queensland is currently debating new laws which would criminalise bail breaches by minors - a change which will cause the youth prison population to increase dramatically, experts warn.. State Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said the recent cases may have breached Queensland's Human Rights Act, which states all prisoners should have access to fresh air and exercise for a minimum of two hours a day.. He warned that changes to the law would only make the situation worse, and that immediate steps were needed to stop children being placed in isolation. . \"Unfortunately, I don't think they're isolated cases,\" he told the BBC. . \"Given the laws that are [being] passed in Queensland, which are clearly intended to incarcerate more children, it becomes even more important that the government urgently develops a coherent plan for preventing children coming within the criminal justice system, \" he said.. \"My concern is by increasing the pressure on the system, we risk normalising the mistreatment of children\".. Mr McDougall urged the state government to \"double down\" on measures to keep children in school and stop them going down \"the path of criminalisation\".. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were 12 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous Australians in 2021, the Queensland Statisticians Office says. . Rates of juvenile incarceration are also high, with Indigenous children accounting for some 70% of detainees across most of Queensland, and over 90% in the state's north. . Overcrowded facilities mean children and minors often have to be housed in adult prisons known as watch houses. Most juvenile detainees are being held on remand. . In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs said solitary confinement or \"separations\" were only used as a last resort. . Youth detention centres were \"complex and difficult environments, and practices used in the centres are designed to ensure the safety of staff and young people at all times,\" the spokesperson said.. \"At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities.\".
