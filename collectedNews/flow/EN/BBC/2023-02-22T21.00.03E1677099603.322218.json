        "content": "Wagnerites have been deeply involved in the siege of Bakhmut in east Ukraine.. The defence ministry denied his claims.. \"All statements allegedly made by assault units on shell shortages are absolutely untrue,\" it said, without naming either Prigozhin or the Wagner group.. Describing the arming of mercenary groups as a priority, the ministry listed 1,660 rockets, 10,171 artillery rounds and mortars and 980 tank rounds that had been supplied between Saturday 18 February and the following Monday.. Prigozhin, who founded Wagner, for years had close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin but the war in Ukraine has prompted an increasingly bitter rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular army, and analysts believe he no longer has the president's ear.. Mercenary groups like Wagner are supposedly illegal in Russia but Prigozhin has not only registered it as a company but was filmed last year openly recruiting for the war from Russia's prisons.. Last month Wagner claimed victory in the eastern town of Soledar, only for the defence ministry to say later that it was in control of the town. . The fight for Bakhmut has gone on for more than six months and has become the main focus of the Russian offensive in the east. The campaign is believed to have cost thousands of lives.. Never one to hold back, Prigozhin complained that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov not only prevented ammunition from being sent but did not help with air transport or even providing shovels for digging trenches. . Such direct opposition within the military to equipping his fighters amounted to treason, he said.. When the ministry denied his allegations, he hit back describing its statement as \"spitting\" at Wagner, complaining it had not received 80% of the ammunition requested to carry out its combat missions.. He then posted a picture, apparently from the Bakhmut area, of the corpses of dozens of mercenaries killed in battle lying on the frozen ground awaiting collection.. \"These are the guys who died yesterday because of so-called 'shell shortages'. There are five times more of them than there should have been,\" he said in an audio message to his press service.. He called on Russians to demand publicly, but without resorting to demonstrations, that the defence ministry give ammunition to his troops.. The raw power struggle at the heart of Russia's war in Ukraine has prompted commentators to speculate whether Prigozhin is being squeezed out by Gen Gerasimov, who was recently put in charge of the campaign.. Pro-Kremlin pundit Sergei Markov said Russians who backed the war were clearly backing Prigozhin and the squabble would undermine the defence ministry's authority.. Russia expert Mark Galeotti said that if ammunition was being withheld then, along with the rotation of Wagner troops away from Bakhmut, \".  (however meaningless) for some time\".. \"We will not leave Bakhmut,\" vowed Prigozhin in his audio message. \"We'll simply die in double the numbers until all [the Wagnerites] are finished. And when the Wagnerites are completely finished, most likely Shoigu and Gerasimov will have to pick up machine guns.\". ",

        "content": "The Israeli military said its forces surrounded a building while looking for \"wanted terror suspects\".  . The men were shot and killed after they opened fire at the troops, it added.. The troops also shot back after coming under fire from other armed men and having explosives, petrol bombs and stones thrown at them during the clashes, according to the military.. The Palestinian health ministry said 72-year-old Adnan Saabe Baara was among those killed during the raid. . Video footage showed a body in a street next to bags of bread, in what is usually a busy market area of the old city. . A 61-year-old man called Abdul Hadi Abdul Aziz Ashqar and a 16-year-old boy Mohammad Farid Shaaban also died, according to the health ministry.. More than 100 other Palestinians were also wounded by gunfire. Seven of them are in a critical condition in local hospitals.. The Israeli military named the three militants who were the targets of the raid as Mohammed Abdul Fattah, 23, a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Walid Dkhail, 23, and Hussam Isleem, 24, of the Lion's Den group. . The military said they were suspected of carrying out previous shooting attacks, including one last October that killed an Israeli soldier, and of planning others in the near future.. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he condemned the raid and held Israel's government responsible for \"this dangerous escalation, which is pushing the region toward tension and an explosion\".. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, warned that it was \"monitoring the escalating crimes conducted by the enemy against our people in the occupied West Bank and is running out of patience\".. Nablus and nearby Jenin have been the focus of search, arrest and intelligence gathering raids that Israel has intensified over the last year amid a spate of deadly Palestinian attacks.. This latest one comes despite reports this week of an understanding brokered by the US aimed at calming tensions.. So far this year, at least 50 Palestinians - including militants and civilians - have been killed, while 11 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis.. ",

Wind gusts potentially reaching 50mph (80kph) and a wind chill as low as -50F (-45C) in some parts are predicted.. In northern states, forecasts of up to two feet (0.6m) of snow in some parts could mean areas endure their biggest snowfalls for 30 years.. Minnesota's governor Tim Walz said the National Guard will be available to help motorists who become stuck in the blizzard conditions there.. \"This is a reminder to stay home and limit travel if possible,\" the Utah Department of Transport warned morning commuters.. Forecasters said the storm system could produce an icy band across 1,300m (2092km) from Nebraska to New Hampshire. . Meanwhile, typically sunny and warm Los Angeles, California, will see major snow and winds up to 75mph in the mountains and foothills of Ventura and Los Angeles County.. All of California \"will be able to see snow from some vantage point later this week,\" tweeted David Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California-Los Angeles..

        "content": "Schools have been shut and traffic has been suspended in 10 regions.. Earlier, Freddy caused some damage in Mauritius, flooding beachside hotels.. The head of Madagascar's National Office of Risk and Disaster Management told the BBC that \"negligence\" was to blame for the deaths.. \"Despite the awareness that we spread. People still dare to ignore the instructions and the warnings,\" said Elack Olivier Andrikaja, adding that three of the deaths happened when a home collapsed.. However, the mayor of Mananjary, one of the worst-affected towns, said the damage was not as bad as in previous cyclones because those living close to the river had been evacuated in time.. \"We were better prepared this time,\" Denis Franconio told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. \"Before the cyclone's arrival, the authorities, especially the central government, took the necessary measures by distributing items like rice, clothes, kitchen materials for the people in need.\" . However, he is worried about the future.. \"People live on agriculture here and I am really concerned about famine because everything has been destroyed. First, people will need food urgently and secondly they will need seeds to ensure they can cultivate their crops.\". The Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable to cyclones. It is hit by an average of 1.5 cyclones every year, the highest rate in Africa, according to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.. The cyclone slightly weakened once it made landfall on Madagascar, with wind gusts exceeding 130km/h (81mph). The country's meteorological service warned that torrential rains would continue along its path. . \"The sea remains very rough... and a significant risk of coastal flooding will continue overnight,\" it said. . A 27-year-old man drowned near the port of Mahanoro before the storm made landfall, officials said. . Officials also said 7,000 people had been pre-emptively evacuated from the coastal region directly in Freddy's path, and warnings waves could reach over 8m (26ft) were issued by the International Federation of Red Cross. . Some people used sandbags to weigh down their roofs as a precaution, but that did not stop the storm from ripping roofs off houses.. \"All the doors and windows started shaking,\" said Mananjary resident Tahina.. She had fled her home with her parents and three children to shelter in her husband's office.. \"Next to us, at least five houses have lost their roofs,\" Tahina told AFP news agency.. Pascal Salle sobbed as he surveyed the damage caused by Freddy - which had ripped a window off of his home and turned his garden into a \"sandy field\".. \"It's a repeat performance. I can't take this every year, it's not possible. Batsirai and Emnati in 2022, Freddy in 2023... Who's to say that in 15 days another one won't fall on us?\" he said.. Last month the powerful storm Cheneso smashed into north-eastern Madagascar bringing in heavy winds and triggering downpours that caused extensive flooding, and killing at least 33 people and forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.. Mananjary is still recovering from devastation caused by last year's Cyclone Batsirai, which killed more than 130 people across Madagascar.. Cyclone Freddy is forecast to cross the ocean from Madagascar and make landfall in Mozambique, before potentially moving further inland to hit Zimbabwe, UN officials say. . The body estimates that more than two million people could be affected.. ",

        "content": "There they were, sitting within handshake distance, with an oval shaped table in the middle.. It could be that the proximity was achieved by seating placement at a previously-used table, with the Chinese delegation directly across the middle rather than at the long ends but the effect was the same. . When the footage was released, it appeared to be a deliberately symbolic move to show that he felt safe enough to be that close to the representative of such an important friend.. Of course, it hasn't always been that way. Decades ago, Beijing's network of underground fallout shelters were designed to protect the citizens of the Chinese capital from a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.. Yet now Xi Jinping's administration sees Russia as a front-line enemy of US influence. A nation which - like North Korea - may be considered an international pariah but which serves a useful geopolitical purpose.. The Chinese government didn't even seem that embarrassed when President Putin returned home from attending Beijing Winter Olympics, having proclaimed a new \"no limits\" relationship with China and, within weeks, launched the invasion of Ukraine.. Many have asked whether Mr Xi was warned about the imminent war when he sat next to his Russian counterpart who must have been considering barely anything else at the time.. China is walking along a very delicate path in its dealings with Russia over Ukraine. Mr Xi may feel like he's confidently striding down the track, but some think that the path is crumbling at the edges, with Beijing's claim to neutrality increasingly difficult to stand up.. Wang Yi comes out of meetings proclaiming that China and Russia are together promoting \"peace and stability\".. In other parts of the world, it will seem ludicrous to use expressions like \"peace and stability\" on a trip to Russia almost one year before the first anniversary of that country's invasion of Ukraine.. Beijing knows this and yet decided to press ahead nevertheless, in the full knowledge that it will take a hit reputationally because it has calculated that is more important to offer significant moral support to Vladimir Putin at this time.. When Wang Yi met Sergei Lavrov he said, \"I am ready to exchange views with you my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest and I look forward to reaching new agreements\".. Russia's Foreign Minister said the two were showing solidarity and defending each other's interests despite \"high turbulence on the world stage\", as if this turbulence was something floating in the ether rather than chaos of his own government's making.. This video can not be played. Watch: Putin and Biden's speeches compared in under a minute. Earlier this week in Beijing, China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned that the conflict in Ukraine could spiral out of control if certain countries keep pouring fuel on the fire.. He was referring to the US, a country which is openly giving military assistance to the Ukrainian army but which has warned China not to provide Russia with weapons and ammunition.. Analysts are now asking what options China might consider if it looks like President Putin is facing a humiliating battlefield defeat.. Researchers in America say that Beijing is already supplying Russia with dual use equipment, technology which can appear to be civilian, but which can also, for example, be used to repair jet fighters.. It has also not tried to hide the fact that it is buying up Russian oil and gas to make up for markets its neighbour lost due to sanctions which followed the invasion.. And Vladimir Putin confirmed in his meeting with Wang Yi that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will soon travel to Moscow. It is thought this might happen in the coming months.. In a way, the Kremlin is doing China's dirty work. It is draining Western military resources and putting pressure on Nato and if Russia's economy tanks because of it, does that really matter to Beijing? It will just need more Chinese products for the recovery afterwards.. The problem is that Western countries have been quite united, Russia doesn't appear able to win and, increasingly, China is being seen standing side by side with a bully who forced a bloody, prolonged, war on Europe.. China has to be careful not to bite off more than it can handle, but the rest of the world also won't want Asia's giant dragged into this war to a greater extent than it already is.. ",
