        "content": "The attack would also mark Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February, which celebrates the army. . Meanwhile, three people have died in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk.. Seven others were wounded in the city in Donetsk region after a Russian missile struck a residential building, the provincial governor said. . The toll is expected to rise as rescuers comb through the wreckage.. \"The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,\" Mr Zelensky wrote on social media about the attack. \"By tanks. Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.\". Ukraine . to help protect itself from air attacks after Germany, the US and the UK agreed to send them tanks. . Mr Reznikov said Moscow had mobilised some 500,000 troops for the potential offensive.. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a .  which he said was necessary to ensure the country's \"territorial integrity\". . But Mr Reznikov suggested that the true figure recruited and deployed to Ukraine could be far higher. . \"Officially they announced 300,000 but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments it is much more,\" he told the French BFM network. The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. . Despite some heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region, the war has entered something of a stalemate in recent months since Ukraine retook the southern city of Kherson. . With the exception of the .  neither side has made major territorial advances. . But a Russian spring offensive - and a Ukrainian counter-offensive - has long been considered likely. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to \"undertake a decisive action\" and launch a \"big offensive\" in the east. . Mr Reznikov said Ukraine's commanders would seek to \"stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive\" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. . \"I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,\" he said, adding that Ukraine's forces \"cannot lose the initiative\" they have achieved in recent months. . The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would \"significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types\". . Mr Reznikov's comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. . But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.. \"That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,\" Mr Stoltenberg said. . \"And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.\". Meanwhile, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. . She added that Moscow's troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. . \"Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \"Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,\" she said. . Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. . \"There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. \"The situation is becoming even more severe.\". While the Wagner group has claimed it has been heavily involved in Russia's recent advances in the east, a former commander who fled to Norway has .  that he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for the group. . Andrei Medvedev made an unverified claim that in the four months he was with Wagner, he saw two people who didn't want to fight being shot. . About 80% of Wagner's personnel in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, according to the US National Security Council.. ",

        "content": "Five officers were charged last week over his death.. Relatives as well as national figures, including Vice-President Kamala Harris and actor Spike Lee, came to Tennessee to pay their respects. . During the three-hour ceremony that featured gospel songs and African drumming, those who knew Mr Nichols spoke of a kind and caring father who enjoyed skateboarding and photography, while many called for police reforms. . Rev. Dr J. Lawrence Turner, a pastor at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, began the service by mourning a \"son, father, brother, friend, human being gone too soon and denied his rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\".. Several other prominent leaders also gave speeches, including Vice-President Harris, who told Mr Nichols' family the country was mourning with them. . \"Mothers around the world, when their babies are born, pray to God when they hold that child that that body and that life will be safe,\" she said. \"Yet we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today.\" . She called Mr Nichols' death \"an act of violence at the hands and the feet of people who have been charged with keeping them safe\", and called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. . Graphic bodycam footage of Mr Nichols' encounter with police released last week showed him being brutally punched, kicked, pepper-sprayed and hit by police officers. . Mr Nichols was black, as are the police officers now charged with second-degree murder, assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and oppression. . None have not entered a plea, but lawyers for two of the men earlier said they would contest the charges.. The families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom died as a result of police violence, were also in attendance. . Mr Nichols' siblings remembered their brother as someone who touched many lives, including older sister Keyana Dixon, who said through tears that her younger brother was \"robbed of his life, his passions and his talents, but not his light\". . Mr Nichols' other sister recited a poem titled \"I'm just trying to go home\", a reference to what Mr Nichols' told police officers in bodycam footage. . \"I've skated across barriers designed to hold me back. I'm just trying to go home, where the love is loud and the smiles are warm, like the sunsets that come for me in the coldest of my storms,\" she said. . Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton noted Mr Nichols was murdered in the same city as Dr Martin Luther King Jr 55 years before. There's \"nothing more insulting and offensive\" than police officers beating their \"brother\" to death, he said.. \"If that man had been white you wouldn't have beat him like that that night,\" he said, pledging to never let Mr Nichols' \"memory die\". .  representing Mr Nichols' family, said police failed to see him as a human being. He said the world needed to secure \"equal justice\" for Mr Nichols. . He and other civil rights activists have argued police culture is to blame for Mr Nichols' death. . They have said Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis' swift response in charging the five police officers should be a\"blueprint\" for justice going forward. . Ms Davis has said the treatment of Mr Nichols \"defied humanity\". . Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, who spoke briefly during the service, also urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd policing act because \"there should be no other child that's suffered\" the way her son and many others have, she said. . The youngest of four children, Mr Nichols grew up in Sacramento, California before moving to Memphis in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic to be closer to his mother. He was a father to a four-year-old boy, and worked at FedEx with his stepfather Rodney Wells.. A photo slideshow played during the funeral displayed Mr Nichols' many life passions, including capturing sunsets on camera and spending time with his son. . ",
