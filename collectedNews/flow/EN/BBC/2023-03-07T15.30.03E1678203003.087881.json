        "content": "Watch: Japan forces H3 rocket to self-destruct after engine failure. Its space agency had to send a self-destruct command to the H3 rocket when its second-stage engine failed minutes after lift-off.. Observers say it is a significant setback for Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).. The government called the test failure \"extremely regrettable\".. The H3 rocket is the first medium-lift rocket designed by Japan in three decades. . It has been presented as a cheaper alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 for launching commercial and government satellites into Earth's orbit.. On Tuesday, engineers had aimed to send the 57m (187ft) rocket into space with a monitoring satellite on board. The ALOS-3 system is capable of detecting North Korean missile launches.. But Jaxa said soon after launch, engineers were forced to send a self-destruct prompt to the H3 after it experienced \"reduced velocity\" in the second stage of its launch. . Tuesday's launch came after an aborted launch in February, when the rocket failed to get off the launch pad due to faulty rocket boosters. . \"Unlike the previous cancellation and postponement, this time it was a complete failure,\" Hirotaka Watanabe, a space policy professor at Osaka University told Reuters.. \"This will have a serious impact on Japan's future space policy, space business and technological competitiveness,\" he added.. Japan's science minister Keiko Nagaoka said authorities would investigate the cause of the engine failure. . She apologised for \"failing to meet the expectations of the public and related parties\" and described the development as \"extremely regrettable\". . Japan had presented the H3 as a viable commercial alternative to the Falcon 9 rocket because the H3 ran on a lower-cost engine with 3D-printed parts. . Had the mission succeeded, Jaxa said it had planned to launch the H3 around six times a year for the next two decades.. Japan is deepening cooperation with the US in space and has committed to carrying cargo to the planned .  - which Nasa plans to deploy to the moon's orbit.. Tokyo's broader space programme also involves sending people to the moon again, including Japanese astronauts.. ",
