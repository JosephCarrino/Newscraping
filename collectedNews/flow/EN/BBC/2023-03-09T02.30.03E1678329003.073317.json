        "content": "Watch: Police car flipped over as Georgians stay defiant on streets. The crowds are angry at a controversial Russian-style law, which would class non-government and media groups as \"foreign agents\" if they receive more than 20% of their funds from abroad.. On Wednesday evening, police pushed back protesters who pulled down a metal barrier outside parliament. . The crowds were ordered to disperse and some people have been injured.. Pictures from Georgian TV showed hundreds of riot police on the streets late on Wednesday night, wearing helmets and holding shields. At least one police car had been overturned. . Clouds of tear gas rose above the streets around the parliament building as police tried to break up the protests. . Earlier, tens of thousands of people joined the second day of protests. . They took place outside parliament, where on Tuesday lawmakers backed a first reading of the controversial new law, which has been widely condemned internationally. . A similar law in Russia has been used to severely limit press freedom and supress civil society. . \"We think that our government is under Russian influence and it's very bad for our future,\" said Lizzie, one of many students taking part in the protests.. The protesters worry that the new law, if passed, would damage the country's hopes of joining the EU. . \"People are really angry because this is not about one specific thing, it's about the future of Georgia and it's about how we'll function as a country,\" another demonstrator named Tekla Tevdorashvili told the BBC.. \"Everyone is really against this and I think that's why they're so afraid and that's why the government is trying to use everything that they can against the people to silence us but we will not be silenced.\". In a statement, the US expressed solidarity with the protesters and called on Georgia's government to allow peaceful demonstrations.. \"We urge the government of Georgia to respect the freedom of peaceful assembly and peaceful protests,\" state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. \"We are standing with the people of Georgia and the aspirations that they have.\". Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, also expressed his support for the Georgian people. . Authorities said 55 police were hurt during the first night of protests, when stones and petrol bombs were thrown at them. Some of the most arresting images of Tuesday night came when a water cannon was sprayed at protesters waving EU flags. . Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili denounced the \"stir\" over the draft law, which went through its first reading inside parliament on Tuesday. Ruling party Georgian Dream maintains the legislation dates back to US legislation in the 1930s. The same argument was used by Russia after it passed a similar law in 2012.. Russia's law has since been expanded to suppress Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers. Anyone identified as a foreign agent now has to highlight a foreign-agent label on their publication.. Opposition-supporting TV stations have also dubbed the proposed legislation as a \"Russian law\". . Georgia has applied to the European Union for candidate status and also aims to join Nato, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\".. Another student, Lia Chagovadze, said she and her friends were there to fight for Western values and freedom, while Nanuka Shakinovi said the protesters would not allow the government to stop Georgia's push to join the EU: \"We are going to fight them and we will not stop until we win.\". \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old Luka Kimeridze.. Georgian Dream chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said criticism of the draft law as similar to Russia's own repressive legislation was misleading. \"In the end, the stir will die out and the public will have transparency in the funding of NGOs,\" he said.. However, Eka Gigauri of Transparency International told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Political tensions in Georgia have been heightened by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, seen by many Georgians as a war of aggression by Moscow, and many thousands of Russians have fled there. However, the government in Tbilisi has adopted a neutral stance, refusing to openly back Ukraine or impose sanctions on Russia.. Speaking via video during a visit to New York, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\". She has vowed to veto the legislation, but Georgian Dream has enough votes to override the president's veto in parliament. The party has applied to the Council of Europe for its opinion.. Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs.. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society.. ",

        "content": "Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. For now, the Mexican government remains tight-lipped about the motive for the attack. However, the attorney general's office in the state of Tamaulipas said the theory that this was a case of mistaken identity was \"strengthening\".  . Officials wouldn't comment on two specific suggestions - that a drug gang had confused them either for US-based rivals, Haitian drug gang members or people smugglers. But they said there were multiple and \"diverse\" lines of investigation, and that none was being ruled out at this stage. . Matamoros is caught between warring factions of the Gulf Cartel, as they battle for control of the so-called plazas - the drug smuggling routes north into the US.. Apparently unwitting, the group of friends from North Carolina drove their minivan straight into that maelstrom. Their ordeal lasted for four days.  . As the US citizens were being moved between safehouses to prevent detection, the US Embassy issued a statement demanding their immediate release. For any Mexican cartel - or even a common criminal gang operating along the border - that will have spelt trouble.  . The armed gang will have understood immediately that the full force of a joint operation by US and Mexican federal law enforcement was going to be turned in their direction. Had the motive been ransom, as is so often the case in Mexico, they will have realised it was now very unlikely to be paid.. Far easier, then, to simply turn the Americans over and deflect some of the intense heat bearing down on their gang. . \"My guess is that's the most reasonable explanation for what happened,\" says Mexican drug war analyst, Alejandro Hope. \"They might have had connections or contacts with local police and they just told their contacts where their safehouse was.\". Kidnappings in Mexico are disturbingly common. Last year, Mexico reached the horrific figure of 100,000 people disappeared or missing in the country. Most kidnappings are carried out with complete impunity, particularly in the case of undocumented immigrants travelling north to the US.  . In comparison, this case was resolved incredibly quickly. Some Mexicans voiced frustration on social media at the speed with which such crimes are resolved when foreigners are involved. . \"In under a week. And the thousands and thousands of kidnapped Mexicans?\" wrote one Twitter user.  . \"That's not untrue,\" says Mr Hope. \"Mexican institutions have a limited set of capabilities. But if they focus those capabilities on specific cases, yes, they can solve them.\"  . \"It's about visibility and political impact,\" he says.  . Clearly, in this instance, the political will in Mexico to find a solution couldn't have been higher.. US Ambassador Ken Salazar met Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss the matter, and said the US State Department had \"no greater priority\" than the well-being of its citizens abroad.  . The case was brought to an end within 24 hours.  . This video can not be played. Mexico missing: 'If I find a body, I recover a piece of my son'. ",

        "content": "The warming gas can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored safely and cheaply in seawater. . The new method could speed up the deployment of carbon removal technology, experts say.. While the world has struggled to limit and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in recent decades, several companies have instead focussed on developing technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.. Climeworks in Switzerland is perhaps the best known. Over the past ten years it has developed machines to suck in the air from the atmosphere that filter and trap the carbon dioxide molecules. . At a .  the captured CO2 is injected deep underground where it is permanently turned into stone. . The company has recently started selling a certified carbon removal service to large corporate clients including Microsoft, Spotify and Stripe.. However, one big problem for most current approaches to direct air capture is cost. . CO2, although a powerful warming agent, is relatively diluted in the atmosphere at around 400 parts per million (ppm) in air. . So big machines that require large amounts of energy are needed to both absorb and discharge the CO2. . This new approach, using off-the-shelf resins and other chemicals, promises far greater efficiency and lower cost, say the scientists involved.. The research team have borrowed an approach used for applications in water, and \"tweaked\" existing materials to remove CO2 from the air. . In tests, the new hybrid absorbing material was able to take in three times as much CO2 as existing substances.. \"To my knowledge, there is no absorbing material which even at 100,000 ppm, shows the capacity we get it in direct air capture of 400 ppm,\" said lead author Prof Arup SenGupta from Lehigh University in the US.. \"This simple ability to capture CO2 at a high quantity, in a small volume of material, is a unique aspect of our work.\" . The development, while in its early stages, has been welcomed by others in the field.. \"I am happy to see this paper in the published literature, it is very exciting, and it stands a good chance of transforming the CO2 capture efforts,\" said Prof Catherine Peters from Princeton University, an expert in geological engineering, who wasn't involved in the research project.. \"What is clever about this is that the starting point was a technology previously designed for applications in water. This advance applies this technology to the gas phase - a new idea.\". \"The demonstrated performance for CO2 capture is promising.\". One of the big challenges in capturing CO2 is what to do with the trapped gas. . Storing it under the ground or sea in former oil wells is one widely used approach. But the new paper suggests that with the addition of some chemicals the captured CO2 can be transformed into bicarbonate of soda and stored simply and safely in sea water. . Dr SenGupta says he now wants to establish a spin-off company to develop the technology further. . He believes that removing CO2 in this way will not only be critical to limiting the rise in global temperatures but could also be directly empowering for developing countries. . \"We have to take it to places like Bangladesh, Barbados or the Maldives, they also have a role to play, they cannot be just bystanders who keep suffering.\". Some scientists are reluctant to put too much emphasis on new and emerging technologies like direct air capture because they fear that it could dilute the carbon cutting efforts of governments and individuals.. But with the temperature thresholds of the Paris climate agreement under threat from rising emissions, many others feel that the rapid deployment of direct air capture in addition to massive cuts in carbon is the best hope of avoiding dangerous climate change. . \"It has become even more important now that we are definitely in an overshoot regime, where we have to take carbon back from the environment,\" said Prof Klaus Lackner, a pioneer in the field of removing CO2.. \"DAC will have to get cheaper to make a useful contribution. I am optimistic that it can do this.\". Professor SenGupta shares that optimism, believing that this new approach can remove CO2 for less than $100 a tonne.. The research has been .  in the journal, Science Advances. . ",

Gang violence and kidnappings in Haiti have risen sharply since President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021.. The Caribbean nation has been facing a growing economic crisis. . The charity, commonly known by its French abbreviation MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières), made the move after heavily armed gangs expanded their territory to new areas in Port-au-Prince and nearby towns.. Several schools have also closed as kidnappings increase.. Earlier this year, an MSF-backed public hospital located south of the capital also closed after a patient was killed by a bullet as he left the emergency room.. Cité Soleil, an impoverished neighbourhood on the outskirts of Haiti's capital, now has just one private hospital and one other MSF operation, which is reducing operations.. Vincent Harris, a medical adviser for the aid group, said: \"We are living scenes of warfare just meters [yards] from the establishment.. \"Our hospital has not been directly targeted but we have been a collateral victim of the fighting since the hospital found itself on the frontline.\". Field communication manager Alexandre Marcou said a child who was on oxygen had died in a security room, where patients are sent for protection from gunfire around the building.. A 70-year-old man had also been found shot as he tried to cross the street to the hospital.. Haiti has been led by Prime Minister Ariel Henry since Moïse's death, but he has failed to rein in the gangs which control much of the capital.. Mr Henry has repeatedly called for the deployment of an international force to help police in their fight against the criminal gangs.. So far, no country has offered to lead such a force, while Mr Henry says it is key to providing security so that long-postponed elections can be held.. This video can not be played.
