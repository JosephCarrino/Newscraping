        "content": "His case was highly controversial as he was assessed by a medical expert to have an IQ of 69 - a level that indicates an intellectual disability.. But the government said he \"clearly understood the nature of his acts\".. The court had earlier on Tuesday dismissed a last-ditch appeal by his mother, adding that Nagaenthran had been given \"due process in accordance with the law\", adding that he had \"exhausted his rights of appeal and almost every other recourse under the law over some 11 years\". . At the end of Tuesday's hearing, Nagaenthran and his family had reached through a gap in a glass screen to grasp each other's hands tightly as they wept, according to a Reuters report. His cries of \"ma\" could be heard in the courtroom. . In an earlier statement, the government said they found he \"did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing\".. In 2009, Nagaenthran was caught crossing into Singapore from Malaysia with 43g (1.5oz) heroin strapped to his left thigh.. Under Singapore's drug laws - which are among the toughest in the world - those caught carrying more than 15g of heroin are subject to the death penalty.. During his trial, the 34-year-old initially said he was coerced into carrying the drugs, but later said he had committed the offence because he needed money. . The court said his initial defence was \"fabricated\". He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging.. In 2015, he appealed to have his sentence commuted to life in prison on the basis that he suffered from an intellectual disability.. His lawyers had argued that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law. . But a court found that he was not intellectually disabled. A push for presidential clemency was also rejected last year.. \"The Court of Appeal found that this was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question,\" said Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs in an earlier statement.. The movement has gained traction on social media, where there has been an unusual outpouring of anger and sympathy, including from the British billionaire Richard Branson and actor Stephen Fry, who oppose capital punishment and have called on Singapore to spare Nagaenthran.. Thousands had also signed a petition, arguing that the execution of a mentally ill person is prohibited under international human rights law. . The execution was on Tuesday condemned by rights group Reprieve, who called him the \"victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice\". . \"Nagen's last days were spent, like much of the last decade, in the torturous isolation of solitary confinement,\" said Reprieve's Director Maya Foa. . \"Our thoughts are with Nagen's family, who never stopped fighting for him; their pain is unimaginable.\"   . Singaporean anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han also released a photo of Nagaenthran on Wednesday, which pictured him reportedly wearing his favourite outfit.. The Singapore government has previously argued that international law does not prohibit the death penalty and that there is no international consensus on the use of it.. that under Singapore law, he would not have been given the death penalty if the court had found him to be \"suffering from an abnormality of mind which substantially impaired his mental responsibility\"..

        "content": "The Bulgarian Energy Ministry also said it had been informed deliveries would be suspended from Wednesday. . It comes after Russia .  or it would cut supplies.. Both countries have refused to pay in this way. . PGNiG relies on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from the Russian company in the first quarter of this year.. It described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas. . Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. . The country's energy ministry said Bulgaria had fulfilled its obligations under the current contract with Gazprom and made all required payments. . It added that the new payment system proposed by Russia was in breach of the existing contract. . Following the news, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. . Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. . Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister, Marcin Przydacz, said his country had been preparing for the possibility Russia might limit gas exports by diversifying its supplies. . \"I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,\" he told the BBC. . He added that the suspension proved Moscow was \"not a reliable partner in any kind of business\" and urged other European nations like Germany to support a ban on Russian energy imports. . Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. . PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and, with summer approaching, demand was lower.. Poland also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. . On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is also due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal.. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the \"Baltic Pipe\", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries.. The gas supply cut does not mean Poland will immediately be unable to meet customer demand. . In recent years, Poland has reduced its dependence on Russian gas and it now buys LNG from Qatar and pipelines connect the country to the European market. Plus, the winter heating season is over, so demand is lower. . But Gazprom supplies more than half of all Poland's gas imports. That's a big hole to fill. . And Poland is not the only EU country now seeking to stop buying Russian energy. . There's a lot of competition on an already tight gas supply market. When the heating season starts again in the autumn and demand rises, Poland could face a tricky few months securing enough supply. . And if it does so, it may have to restrict supplies to large industrial users. . Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. . However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. . The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports.. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds..

        "content": "The discovery was made by a farmer digging his land in Khan Younis, in the south of the strip.. On social media, some Gazans are making wry comments suggesting the goddess's association with war seems apt.. In recent years, they have seen a series of devastating flare-ups in the conflict between Israel and militant groups in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.  . However, the discovery of this limestone statue is a reminder of how the strip - part of an important trade route for successive ancient civilisations - was originally a Canaanite settlement.. The 22cm-high (8.7 in) carving clearly shows the face of the goddess wearing a serpent crown.. \"We found it by chance. It was muddy and we washed it with water,\" said farmer Nidal Abu Eid, who came across the head while cultivating his field.  . \"We realised that it was a precious thing, but we didn't know it was of such great archaeological value,\" he told the BBC.. \"We thank God, and we are proud that it stayed in our land, in Palestine, since the Canaanite times.\" . The statue of Anat - one of the best-known Canaanite deities - is now on display in Qasr al-Basha, a historic building that serves as one of Gaza's few museums. . Unveiling the artefact at a press conference on Tuesday, Jamal Abu Rida of the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said the statue was \"resistant against time\" and had been carefully examined by experts.. He said that it made a political point.. \"Such discoveries prove that Palestine has civilisation and history, and no-one can deny or falsify this history,\" he said. \"This is the Palestinian people and their ancient Canaanite civilisation.\". Not all archaeological finds in Gaza have been so highly appreciated or fared so well.  . Hamas - an Islamist, militant organisation - has previously been accused of destroying the remains of a large, fortified Canaanite town, Tell al-Sakan, to make way for housing and military bases south of highly populated Gaza City.. , but later disappeared mysteriously.. However, this year Hamas reopened the remains of a 5th Century Byzantine church after foreign donors helped pay for a years-long restoration project.. Work also stopped at a building site in northern Gaza when 31 Roman-era tombs were found there.. While such ancient sites could potentially be a draw for foreign visitors, it has virtually no tourism industry. . Israel and Egypt tightly restrict the flow of people in and out of the impoverished coastal enclave, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, citing security concerns. .

He accused Ukrainian soldiers of holding civilians as human shields. But Ukrainian defenders have said attacks are continuing and civilians are trapped.. America's top defence official warned the West it had to \"move at the speed of war\" to support Ukraine's military fight against the Russian invasion. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired four-star general, told a gathering of 40 nations' defence ministers that the coming weeks would be \"so crucial for Ukraine\". . Germany slightly shifted its position of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. The country has a long-standing policy of not exporting its military equipment, but has now agreed to provide about 50 mobile anti-aircraft systems..

PGNiG said that reserve stocks were mostly full, and customers would see no disruption for the time being.. But the move is a sign of wider potential problems across the continent. . Russia supplies roughly 40% of the EU's gas imports, and the continent does not have enough to supply itself. Amid heightened tensions, Russia has demanded \"hostile countries\" pay it for energy in its own currency, roubles.. The World Bank says the war in Ukraine is set to cause the \"largest commodity shock\" since the 1970s - meaning huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton.. The increases will affect the poorest most, but households and business of all sizes will feel the effects.. Wheat is predicted to go up in price by almost 43% and reach new highs, chicken could go up nearly 42%, soybeans 20% and oil 30%.. ..
