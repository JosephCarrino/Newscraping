        "content": "This escalation would mean \"serious consequences\" for China, he warned.. China has denied reports that Moscow has requested military equipment.. Chinese President Xi Jinping is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is yet to condemn Russia's invasion - but he has sought to remain neutral in the conflict and has called for peace.. China's foreign ministry said it would not accept \"finger pointing\" and \"coercion\" from the US over its relations with Russia.. Mr Blinken was speaking to CBS after he met China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.. He said that during the meeting he expressed \"deep concerns\"  about the \"possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia\".. \"To date, we have seen Chinese companies... provide non-lethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they're considering providing lethal support,\" he said. . He did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China's potential plans. When pressed on what the US believed China might give to Russia, he said it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition.. The .  to the mercenary Wagner Group, which supplies Russia with thousands of fighters. . Mr Blinken told CBS that \"of course, in China, there's really no distinction between private companies and the state\".. If China provided Russia with weapons, that would cause a \"serious problem for us and in our relationship\", he added.. Relations between Washington and Beijing were already poor after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in early February. Both sides exchanged angry words, but equally both sides appeared embarrassed by the incident and seemed ready to move on.. But if China were to deliver weapons to help Russian forces in Ukraine, then US-Chinese relations would deteriorate much more severely.. Mr Blinken's warning seems to be clearly designed to deter China from doing that.. Mr Blinken also said the US was worried about China helping Russia evade Western sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economy. China's trade with Russia has been growing, and it is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas, and coal.. Nato members, including the US, are sending a variety of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, including tanks. They have stopped short of sending fighter jets, and Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether the US would help other countries supply jets.. \"We've been very clear that we shouldn't fixate or focus on any particular weapons system,\" he said. . He did, however, say that the West must ensure Ukraine had what it needed for a potential counter offensive against Russia \"in the months ahead\". Russia is currently trying to advance in eastern regions of Ukraine, where some of the fiercest fighting of the war has taken place.. Mr Wang said in Munich on Saturday that China had \"neither stood by idly nor thrown fuel on the fire\" for the Ukraine war, Reuters reported.. China would publish a document that laid out its position on settling the conflict, Mr Wang said. The document would state that the territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, he said.. \"I suggest that everybody starts to think calmly, especially friends in Europe, about what kind of efforts we can make to stop this war,\" Mr Wang said.. He added that there were \"some forces that seemingly don't want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon\", but did not say who he meant. . The Chinese President, Mr Xi, is scheduled to deliver a \"peace speech\" on the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Friday, 24 February, according to Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tajani.. Mr Tajani told Italian radio that Mr Xi's speech would call for peace without condemning Russia, Reuters reported.. During their meeting, Mr Blinken and Mr Wang also exchanged strong words on the deepening .  that was shot down over the US. . Mr Blinken said during the meeting that the US would not \"stand for any violation of our sovereignty\" and said \"this irresponsible act must never again occur\". . Mr Blinken told CBS that other nations were concerned about what he called China's \"surveillance balloon program\" across five continents.. Mr Wang, meanwhile, called the episode a \"political farce manufactured by the US\" and accused them of \"using all means to block and suppress China\". China has denied sending a spy balloon.. And on Sunday morning, Beijing warned that the US would \"bear all the consequences\" if it escalated the argument over the balloon. China would \"follow through to the end\" in the event \"the US insists on taking advantage of the issue\", it said in a foreign ministry statement reported by Reuters.. The .  - the BBC's US broadcasting partner - is due to air on Sunday.. ",

        "content": "However, hopes of finding anyone else alive in the rubble are fading fast.. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Turkey and announced $100m (£83m) in humanitarian aid.. The epicentre of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on 6 February was in Kahramanmaras. More than 44,000 people are confirmed to have lost their lives in south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria.. The death toll is expected to climb, with about 345,000 apartments in Turkey known to have been destroyed and many people still missing. Neither Turkey nor Syria have said how many people are still unaccounted for.. \"In many of our provinces, search and rescue efforts have been completed,\" the disaster agency's chief, Yunus Sezer, told reporters in Ankara.. He said search and rescue efforts were continuing at around 40 buildings in the two provinces, but he expected this number to fall by Sunday evening.. Rescue workers pulled at least three people from the rubble on Friday, . Mr Blinken has arrived in Turkey to show support, despite the trip being planned before the quake. It is his first trip to Turkey since he took office more than two years ago. . The new aid \"will be moving soon. Sadly, it's less about search and rescue but long-term recovery. This is going to be a long-term effort\", he told reporters.. He added that getting aid into Syria was \"very, very challenging\". . He will travel to Hatay to see humanitarian efforts before travelling to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday. The pair are expected to discuss issues including Turkey's refusal to ratify Sweden and Finland's Nato membership applications.. ",

        "content": "Art lovers in Miami looked on in horror on Thursday night, when a collector accidentally knocked a $42,000 (£34,870) sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons to the ground.. She had tapped it with her finger, witnesses at the event said.. The statue - one of Koons' iconic Dog Balloons - smashed into tiny shards, and had to be swept into dustpans by gallery staff.. The accident happened during the exclusive VIP-only opening night of Art Wynwood, a contemporary art fair held annually in Miami, Florida.. Local artist Stephen Gamson told the Miami Herald he was admiring the sculpture, when an \"older woman\" tapped it, knocking it off its pedestal.. At first he wondered if it was part of a performance piece (Banksy, anyone?) but quickly realised it had been an accident.. \"When this thing fell to the ground, it was like how a car accident draws a huge crowd on the highway,\" Mr Gamson told the paper.. Luckily for the woman, the piece is covered by insurance, Bénédicte Caluch, an art advisor with Bel-Air Fine Art galleries which represents the sculpture, said.. \"It was an event!\" Ms Caluch told the Miami Herald. \"Everybody came to see what happened.\". She added that the woman who caused the damage, who has remained unnamed, was an art collector.. \"Life just stopped for 15 minutes with everyone around,\" Cédric Boero, who also works for Bel-Air Fine Art galleries, told the New York Times.. He added that a colleague spoke to the woman, who said she was \"very very sorry\" and \"just wanted to disappear\".. The sculpture was part of a limited edition which has now shrunk from 799 to 798.. \"That's a good thing for the collectors,\" Mr Boero told the Times, laughing.. Despite being shattered into thousands of pieces, there is still interest in buying the destroyed sculpture.. Mr Gamson offered to buy it there and then because, as he said . , \"it has a really cool story\".. Jeff Koons, 68, has not made any comment on the incident.. His range of Balloon Dog sculptures are among the most iconic works of contemporary art, and have sold for tens of millions of dollars.. Some are enormous - as high as 10ft (3m) - but this ill fated one was just a puppy, at 16 inches (40cm) tall.. They have graced galleries around the world, and were further iconised by Jay-Z in 2017 when the rapper worked directly with Koons to create a 40-foot inflatable Balloon Dog for a stage prop.. In 2019 Koons made history when his Rabbit sculpture sold at auction for $91.1m (£71m) - . . . ",

        "content": "It will be available in Australia and New Zealand this week.. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta chief executive, said the move will improve security and authenticity on the social media apps. . The move comes after Elon Musk, owner of Twitter, implemented the premium Twitter Blue subscription in November 2022. . Meta's paid subscription service is not yet available for businesses, but any individual can pay for verification.. Badges - or \"blue ticks\"-  have been used as verification tools for high-profile accounts to signify their authenticity.. The subscription would give paying users a blue badge, increased visibility of their posts, protection from impersonators and easier access to customer service, Meta said in a . The company told the BBC the change would not affect previously verified accounts, but noted there would be an increase in visibility for some smaller users who become verified thanks to the paid feature. . Allowing paying users access to a blue tick has previously caused trouble for other social media platforms.. Twitter's pay-for verification feature was .  by paying for the badge.. Meta said Instagram and Facebook usernames will have to match a government supplied ID document to be granted verification, and users will have to have a profile picture that includes their face.. Other websites like Reddit, YouTube and Discord similarly use subscription-based models. . Meta has not yet specified when the feature will be rolled out to other countries, although Mr Zuckerberg said in a post it would be \"soon\". . In November, the company announced 11,000 job losses as a result of over-investment during the Covid-19 pandemic.. At the time, Mr Zuckerberg said he had predicted an increase in Meta's growth based on the rise it had over the pandemic, but that ultimately did not happen. . \"Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration,\" he wrote, \"I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments.\". Instead he said \"macroeconomic downturn\" and \"increased competition\" caused revenue to be much lower than expected.. \"I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,\" . They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - and while many in the tech sector were quick to criticise Elon Musk for introducing a paid tier to the social network Twitter, it turns out his peers were watching closely.. Times are tough for Big Tech, but times are also tough for Big Tech's customers, of course - that's you and me. Elon Musk's experiment has proved that people are still prepared to pay for an enhanced experience. . It's often said of enormous free-to-use digital platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok that if you're not paying for the product, you are the product. . That means every drop of data those businesses gather about you is being used to sell you stuff in the form of ads. It's a multi-billion-dollar idea and it has made a lot of firms very, very rich. . But people are waking up to it and voting with their feet. . Apple launched an optional feature which stops your online activity being tracked and guess what - it turns out if you ask people whether they mind companies watching what they do and where they go on the net, most of them choose to opt out. Meta, which owns Facebook, has complained bitterly about it. . Is subscription the alternative, and if so, just how much are consumers prepared to pay? It seems first Musk and now Zuckerberg are determined to find out.. ",
