        "content": "Norfolk Southern is now facing multiple lawsuits filed on behalf of residents, many of whom were forced to evacuate their homes. . It has apologised for the incident. . Speaking at a news conference in East Palestine, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Michael Regan, said that his agency \"will ensure the company is held accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of this community\". . \"Let me be clear: Norfolk Southern will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they've inflicted on this community,\" Mr Regan added in prepared remarks, first seen by NBC News. . Additionally, the EPA will require that Norfolk Southern find and clean contaminated soil and water supplies and reimburse the EPA for its own cleaning efforts, as well as provide information online for residents and take part in public meetings at the EPA's request. . Failures to comply with these conditions will result in the EPA \"immediately\" carrying out the tasks. Norfolk Southern will also have to pay three times the cost. . In the aftermath of the derailment, residents of East Palestine have reported ailments including headaches and nausea, and expressed fears that local water supplies are potentially harmful despite the repeated assurances of state, local and federal officials that the water is safe. . Earlier on Tuesday, the Ohio Health Department opened a new clinic for residents who \"have medical questions or concerns related to the recent train derailment\".. Last week, Norfolk Southern came under intense criticism from East Palestine residents after company representatives failed to appear at a town hall meeting aimed at easing fears.. The company said it was concerned about a \"growing physical threat\" to its employees from \"outside parties\" who may have been in attendance. . CEO Alan Shaw has since apologised for the derailment and vowed that the company will \"not walk away\" from East Palestine. . Former US President Donald Trump plans to visit the town on Wednesday and is expected to criticise the federal government's response to the derailment and chemical spill. . ",

        "content": "Locals have joined forces with rescue workers to search the mud for survivors.. More than 750 people lost their homes as torrents of earth and rock came loose from hillsides after a record amount of rain fell in the coastal area east of São Paulo.. Meteorologists said more than 680mm (26 inches) of rain came down in the municipality of Bertioga in the space of only 24 hours. . But it was the town of São Sebastião, 80km (50 miles) to the north of Bertioga, where all but one of the deaths occurred. . Among the victims are many children. One girl died when a boulder weighing two tonnes crashed into her home.. Another woman was hit by a falling tree. Most of the others were buried in the mud that careened down the hillside. . Meteorologist Marcelo Seluchi told BBC News Brasil a cold front with a combination of very specific characteristics had caused an \"extreme and historic\" weather event - not just heavy rains, but also high swells which made it hard for any of the rainfall to drain away. . Many of the make-shift homes built on steep hillsides could not withstand the force of the water that came rushing down. . More than nine million people in Brazil are estimated to be living in areas prone to mudslides or flooding.. With more heavy rain forecast for the coming days, some left their homes to take shelter in sturdier buildings.. This video can not be played. Heavy rain continues for São Paulo. The area had been particularly busy during the carnival period with families seeking to relax by the seaside.. With some of the roads which had been made impassable by the landslides cleared, visitors have been encouraged to return to their homes to ease the pressure on aid and services in the affected towns. . Landslides and flooding are not uncommon in Brazil. Last year more than 230 people were killed in Petrópolis, north of Rio de Janeiro, when torrential rains caused mudslides in the historic town. .

A 6.4 magnitude tremor struck near the city of Antakya near the border with Syria, where massive quakes devastated both countries on 6 February. . The earlier quakes killed 44,000 people in Turkey and Syria with tens of thousands more left homeless.. Buildings weakened by those tremors collapsed in both countries on Monday. . Turkey's disaster and emergency agency says the 6.4 earthquake occurred at 20:04 local time (17:04 GMT) at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles).. This was followed by a 5.8 aftershock three minutes later and dozens of subsequent aftershocks that were not as severe.. The health minister, Dr Fahrettin Koca, said 294 people have been injured - 18 of them seriously. . It's thought the death toll has been relatively low this time because the earthquake struck in an area that was largely empty after it was badly hit by the 6 February quake. . Reports from the city of Antakya spoke of fear and panic in the streets as ambulances and rescue crews tried to reach the worst affected areas where the walls of badly damaged buildings had collapsed.  . \"I thought the earth was going to split open under my feet,\" local resident Muna al-Omar told Reuters news agency, crying as she held her seven-year-old son. She had been in a tent in a park in the city centre when the new earthquakes hit..
