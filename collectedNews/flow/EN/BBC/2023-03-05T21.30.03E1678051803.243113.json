The blaze, which is now under control, engulfed some 2,000 shelters at Cox's Bazar camp on Sunday.. It is estimated that about 12,000 people, most of whom escaped violence in neighbouring Myanmar, have had their accommodation destroyed.. The cause of the fire is not yet clear and no casualties have been reported..

Hrusikesh Harichandan, from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the BBC there had been \"massive damage\" to the camp.. He said basic services such as water centres and testing facilities had also been affected.. \"My shelter was gutted.

Started in 1969 and now in its 28th edition, the biennial event was this time watched over by military rulers..  and the Fespaco film festival happens only once every two years. So photos from Saturday's ceremony show military men with red berets and machine guns alongside Africa's artistic elite.. Chebbi himself did not attend the award ceremony. It is not known if this was an act of conscientious objection to Burkina Faso's current political situation.. But the man who collected the prize on Chebbi's behalf from soldier-turned-President Ibrahim Traoré, said that winning the Etalon d'or du Yennenga - as the top award is known - \"means a lot\" to Chebbi.. The festival attracts thousands from across the continent with filmmakers from Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, South Africa and more taking part this year. Nearly half of all entries in the fiction category were directed by women..

        "content": "Protests have continued for days.. Clashes with police were reported on Sunday as thousands joined a demonstration in the capital Athens.. Police estimated 12,000 people attended the protest. . They said seven officers were hurt and five arrests were made, the AFP news agency reports.. Some demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.. The protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading \"Down with killer governments\".. On the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track. . The first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.. The train crash has been widely attributed to human error. . A 59-year-old station master in Larissa, who was charged with manslaughter by negligence, appeared in court on Sunday and has been taken into custody.. His lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident. He faces between 10 years and life in jail if convicted.. But many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. A government minister told the BBC that the lack of funding was the direct result of the strict terms of international bailouts imposed after the 2010 debt crisis.. Union members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. Train drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.. The transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a \"sign of respect\" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.. Immediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.. BBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says the crash seems to be becoming a defining political issue for Greece as it prepares to face a general election in the spring.. Media reports have given 9 April as a possible date, but analysts say that date may now be pushed back.. ",
