        "content": "While he didn't say specifically that the two latest objects were Chinese, Mr Schumer told ABC on Sunday that Beijing was likely using a \"crew of balloons\" that had \"probably been all over the world\".. Three objects have been shot down over North America in the past week. . Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that the latest object was shot down on Saturday over the Yukon in north-west Canada.. Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track the object, which Mr Trudeau said had \"violated Canadian airspace\". It was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Trudeau said recovery teams were on the ground trying to find the object and that there was still \"much to know\".. Separately, on Friday, the American military shot down an object the size of a small car off Alaska.. It happened just under a week after the US . .. Mr Schumer implied that suspected surveillance balloons had been in operation for years and that Congress should examine why it took so long for the US to find out about them.. \"The bottom line is, until a few months ago we didn't know of these balloons - our intelligence and our military didn't know,\" he said. . Mr Schumer, who said he had been briefed by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, said the two latest objects were smaller than the first balloon. . Asked whether China would have to shut down any surveillance programme using balloons, he said Beijing had been \"humiliated\".. \"I think the Chinese were caught lying, and it's a real step back for themâ€¦ they look really bad,\" he said.. \"They're not just doing the United States, this is a crew of balloons... they've probably been all over the world,\" he added.. China has yet to respond to Mr Schumer's comments but has denied the first suspected surveillance balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. Referring to the efforts to take out the latest object on Saturday, the White House, which was in communication with Canada, said in a statement that the object had been tracked and monitored for 24 hours. . \"Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,\" it said. . \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\". Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.. Meanwhile, continuing efforts to find and recover Friday's object near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse are being hampered by poor weather.. The US military said in a statement that \"Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety\".. Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the first Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. The US said the balloon was part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that had flown over five continents.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.. Chinese officials have accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\".. In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the situation, maintaining that the balloon was not \"a major breach\".. ",

        "content": "Meanwhile, unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places. . The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 30,000.. More arrests are expected - but the action will be seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. . Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.. With elections looming, .  after spending 20 years in power.. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone, he appeared to blame fate. \"Such things have always happened,\" he said. \"It's part of destiny's plan.\". On the sixth day after the quake hit, the situation is growing more desperate. . On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province. Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.. \"There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,\" Austrian Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said. \"The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.\". The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. . Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. . Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening.. The border crossing between Turkey and Armenia reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.. This video can not be played.

The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 30,000. . Syria has not reported an updated death toll since Friday, so the true number is likely higher.. Hopes are dwindling of finding many more survivors, and on the ground there is a sense that the rescue mission will soon end. . The Syrian Civil Defence Force, or White Helmets, which operates in in rebel-held areas of the country, has told the BBC that the group's search efforts are winding down.. But tens of thousands of rescuers continued their search overnight across affected areas in Turkey and Syria.. The seven-month-old baby, Hamza, was saved on Saturday, and footage from local authorities showed rescuers cheering and hugging one another..
