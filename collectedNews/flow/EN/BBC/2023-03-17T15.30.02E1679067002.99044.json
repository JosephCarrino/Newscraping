        "content": "The visit comes as Beijing, an ally of Russia, has offered proposals to end the war in Ukraine, to which the West has given a lukewarm reception.. Western countries have warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with weapons. . This will be President Xi's first visit to Russia since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. He is due to have lunch with Mr Putin on Monday followed by talks on Tuesday. . A foreign ministry spokeswoman said China would uphold \"an objective and fair position\" on the war in Ukraine and \"play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace\". . UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said that China playing a genuine role in restoring sovereignty to Ukraine would be welcomed.   . The fact the Chinese leader is going to Russia signals Beijing's strong support for Moscow. There's no surprise about that: Mr Putin and Mr Xi share a similar world view, both embrace the idea of a multi-polar world.. Last year the two men declared their partnership has no limits. That's not strictly true.. Up until now China has not supplied Russia with lethal aid to help it win the war in Ukraine, though the US claims China is considering doing so.. As for the declared partnership between Moscow and Beijing, Russia - with an economy a 10th the size of China's - finds itself increasingly in the role of junior partner.. So the Chinese government definitely has some sway over Russia. Other elements driving interest in this visit are Beijing's claim to be neutral and that it has not opposed speculation that it could act as an honest broker between Moscow and Kyiv.. Crucially, China is coming off the back of a major diplomatic coup, having facilitated a deal for Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia to resume diplomatic relations.. However some argue that its stated neutrality is a sham and it is in Beijing's geopolitical interests for the war to continue because Russia is doing its dirty work - taking on the West and eating up Western resources and money.. China's proposals called for peace negotiations and respect for national sovereignty. But the 12-point document did not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Xi - \"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said. . Some US media have reported that Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky will speak by phone after the Chinese leader's visit to Moscow, but this is yet to be confirmed.. Kyiv has been pushing hard for some kind of engagement. Ukraine believes President Xi is making the visit to send a signal to the world that Russia has at least some allies. . In an interview with the BBC before President Xi's visit was announced, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kubela said: \"I don't think China has reached the moment now when it wants to, when it's ready to arm Russia. Nor do I think that this visit will result in peace… The visit to Moscow in itself is a message but I don't think it will have any immediate consequences.\". The message, Mr Kuleba said, was \"that China and Russia are very close, close enough for the Chinese leader to visit his Russian counterpart, who is not doing very well. . \"And I think this is the message to the entire world, to the West but also most importantly, to the non-West, that Russia is not alone, that China is talking to them.\". The US is keen for Mr Xi and Mr Zelensky to be in contact. The US National Security Council's spokesman said it would be \"a very good thing if the two of them talk\". . On Thursday, China's foreign minister urged Kyiv and Moscow to restart peace talks as soon as possible during a phone call with Mr Kuleba, who in turn said the two had discussed the \"significance of the principle of territorial integrity\"..

        "content": "However, after a brief rise, its shares are now tumbling while markets across the UK and Europe have turned negative.. In the US, a group of Wall Street giants injected $30bn (£24.8bn) in a smaller domestic bank.. There had been concern that First Republic was at risk of failure following the collapse of two other mid-sized US banks in recent days. . The rescue by the group of 11 banks including JP Morgan and Citigroup appeared to calm stock markets. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share index closed 1.2% higher. . Stock markets in the UK, France and Germany all opened higher but have since fallen. . Meanwhile, a sell-off in Credit Suisse shares has gathered pace. . Shares in Credit Suisse sank earlier in the week on concerns over its future, before the Swiss National Bank said stepped in with emergency funds.. Credit Suisse has been troubled for a long time and continues to be loss-making.. Earlier this week, it rattled investors when it admitted that it had found \"material weakness\" in its financial reporting. . The issues at Credit Suisse coincided with the failure of two lenders in the US - Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank - raising fears over the health of the banking system.. US regulators stepped in at the weekend to ensure that customers at SVB and Signature Bank had full access to their money.. Days later, concerns emerged that San Francisco-based First Republic would be the next bank at risk of a rush of customers withdrawing their deposits. . It shares had sunk by nearly 70% over the last week.. The .  said the action reflected their \"confidence in the country's banking system\".. US financial officials said the move was \"most welcome, and demonstrates the resilience of the banking system\".  . However, shares in First Republic dropped 20% in after-hours stock market trading after the bank said its was suspending its dividend - its payment to shareholders - \"during this period of uncertainty\".. Swetha Ramachandran, investment director at GAM Investments, said that recent events were \"very different to 2008\" during the financial crisis.. She said authorities were moving \"proactively\" to stem problems at banks.. \"What they're trying to do is really ringfence the specific issues around individual isolated banks to stop them from becoming systemic,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.. Central banks around the world have sharply raised borrowing costs over the past year to try to curb the pace of overall price rises, or inflation. . The moves have hurt the values of the large portfolios of bonds bought by banks when rates were lower, a change that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and has raised questions about whether other firms are facing similar situation.. Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at US asset manager Payden and Regal, said other banks could be caught up in the problem.. \"There could be other vulnerabilities... if central banks are intent on continuing to raise interest rates,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.. \"Historically when that happens we do see fragility, we do see problems in the financial system.\". Before the turbulence in the banking sector erupted, both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates further at meetings next week. However, due to recent events, some have speculated these rate rises might be scaled back or even scrapped.. On Thursday, the ECB announced a further increase to interest rates from 2.5% to 3%.. ",

        "content": "Authorities interpreted the books - about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village - as referring to Hong Kongers and China's government.. The arrests are another deterioration of Hong Konger's rights, critics say.. Human Rights Watch described the arrests as \"shameful\", and said the territory was using its colonial-era sedition law to clamp down on dissent.. Hong Kong media reported police arrested the men, aged 38 and 50, at their apartments on 13 March. They raided their homes in Kowloon and Hong Kong island and seized multiple copies of the books, which are part of a series titled Yangcun.. Both men have been released on bail but must report to the police next month, authorities said.. Officials also confirmed the books were the same that had been the subject of a high-profile trial last year - where a court had to determine if the Yangcun books advocated for rebellion against the state. The court ruled the picture books had \"seditious intention\" and j.  for publishing the books.. The group, aged between 25 and 28, had produced cartoon e-books that some interpreted as trying to explain Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement to children.. In one of the three books, a village of sheep fight back against a group of wolves who are trying to take over their settlement.. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. Under its \"one country, two systems\" principle, residents are supposed to enjoy certain freedoms unavailable on the mainland.. But these rights have been eroded since Beijing in 2020 imposed a national security law in response to the months-long Hong Kong protests against Beijing's control in 2019.. Beijing said the law was needed to bring stability to the city - but critics said it was designed to squash dissent, and weaken Hong Kong's autonomy.. In January, police arrested a 24-year-old student for sedition after he posted a download link of the Yangcun series on Facebook - accompanied by alleged inflammatory statements, local outlet Mingpao reported..

        "content": "State officials said there was no immediate public health risk.. The leak was first discovered in late November, but state officials did not notify the public until Thursday.. The water contains tritium, a common by-product of nuclear plant operations.. A naturally occurring radioactive isotope of hydrogen, tritium emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far in air and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).. Tritium spills occur at nuclear plants on occasion, but are typically contained on-site and rarely affect public health or safety, the NRC says.. Xcel first discovered the leak on 21 November, from a pipe between two buildings at its Monticello plant. The plant is about 35 miles (56km) from the state's most populous city, Minneapolis, upstream along the Mississippi River.. The company said it had notified the state and the NRC the next day.. \"Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,\" the Minnesota-based utility said in a statement on Thursday.. State officials said they had waited to get more information before going public with the leak, but confirmed that the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.. The Minnesota Department of Health has said the leak did not reach the Mississippi River.. Roughly one-quarter of the spilled tritium has been recovered so far, and Xcel has said it may build above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water.. It is also weighing how to treat, re-use or dispose of the collected tritium and water.. The company previously had a small leak at its Monticello plant in 2009.. ",

Representatives of Ghana's national team and Atsu's Turkish club Hatayspor were also at the ceremony for a man seen by many as a national hero. . \"Even at the peak of his career, Astu remained himself and was never overtaken by pride, arrogance or indiscipline,\" Sport Minister Mustapha Ussif told mourners. \"His legacy will remain as an inspiration.\". Atsu's body was recovered a fortnight after the quake from the rubble of his apartment building. . It was returned to Ghana almost a month ago. He will be buried later in his home village in south-eastern Ghana.. Atsu, 31, spent most of his career playing in the English Premier League for clubs including Chelsea, Newcastle and Everton. . He also made 65 appearances for Ghana, and helped the national side reach the finals of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea - where he was awarded goal and player of the tournament. . Many Ghanaians have told the BBC that Atsu will be remembered for his love for humanity, and for supporting the underprivileged in the country.. Hundreds of mourners and well-wishers filed past Atsu's body on Tuesday to say their farewells.. Drumming and brass bands have been part of the colourful cultural display at an otherwise solemn event.. ",
