The Australian Defence Force is in the region helping to evacuate people.. Mr Paech said some 700 people, including 35 with medical needs, had been flown out of Kalkarindji, about 770km (478 miles) south of Darwin, after the Victoria River burst its banks.. \"Defence Australia has given us three big planes - two C130s and one C27 - and they're working to fly evacuees to Katherine,\" he tweeted, referring to a town in the NT.. A spokeswoman for Mr Paech said major floods brought added risks from crocodiles. . \"When the river bursts its banks, they're everywhere\", she told the BBC. . Evacuated people will be housed at a former Covid quarantine facility, Howard Springs, and children will be able to attend local schools, officials said.. The territory declared an emergency for four remote areas this week as the upper Victoria River reached major flood levels.. Emergency Controller Daniel Bacon said roads to a number of remote communities remained cut off and urged people to stay away. . \"We continue to remind everyone that if it's flooded; forget it.\"     . The Bureau of Meteorology said the Victoria River had reached a height of 14m at Kalkarindji, but was now falling. . ",

        "content": "Not enough of the new notes were released, leading to widespread anger and frustration.. Many people were unable to get cash to pay for food and slept outside banks.. The policy was announced last October and the new notes were released in mid-December. People were initially given until the end of January to hand in all their old notes, although this had previously been extended amid the chaotic scenes.. Reading out the ruling, Justice Emmanuel Agim said the correct process had not been followed.. \"The directive given by President is invalid. Such directive is not just handed down after personal conversation with the governor of CBN [Central Bank of Nigeria],\" he said.. The court also berated President Muhammadu Buhari for not obeying a previous provisional order to halt the policy until it decided the case. It said there was nothing to show that President Buhari's directive for the release of old 200 naira notes until 10 April was implemented.. \"Disobedience of order of court shows the country's democracy [is] a mere pretension and now replaced by autocracy,\" it said in a scathing verdict.. Nigerians are still experiencing difficulties accessing cash at banks and cash machines and it is not clear what immediate impact the reversal will have.. Many had already deposited their old notes at the banks and with the new ones unavailable, large numbers have switched to online banking.. However, millions of people and businesses in the rural areas remain heavily dependent on cash.. Sixteen Nigerian states had challenged the redesign of the 200, 500, and 1,000 naira notes, saying that the deadline was too tight.. The central bank said that the redesign would help bring down inflation, control the amount of money in circulation and make ransom payments in Nigeria's huge kidnap industry more difficult. Many suspected that the policy was also targeted at politicians involved in vote-buying during elections.. A tightly contested presidential election last Saturday was won by the ruling party. Some cases of vote-buying were reported, but fewer than in previous polls.. ",

        "content": "Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.. He faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.. Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.. Alex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.. \"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.. The case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO. . Murdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area. Such was their influence that the jurisdiction became known as \"Murdaugh Country\".. But the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.. Murdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.. After the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.. Reporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.. It took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case. . In a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.. \"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.. The case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial. . Instead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.. This video can not be played. Watch: Jury finds Murdaugh guilty. Paul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle. . For 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping. . But in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background. . On the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state. . The court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. The hitman he hired botched the shooting and the bullet only grazed his head.. Local resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter. . \"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\". Early on in the proceedings, Judge Clifton Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.. Investigators say he stole nearly $9m from clients and colleagues to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft. . Prosecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.. Murdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder. . Several witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle. . Maggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.. Alex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns. . Prosecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.. Maggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.. ",

Demonstrators were met with police brutality and Lukashenko critics .  during the demonstrations, which started in 2020.. Mr Bialiatski was in court alongside two fellow campaigners, Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich. .

Mr Bialiatski's wife, Natalya Pinchuk, said the trial was \"obviously against human rights defenders for their human rights work\", describing it as a \"cruel\" verdict. . Referring to her husband's letters from prison, where he has been held since arrest, she said: \"He always writes that everything is fine. He doesn't complain about his health - he tries not to upset me.\" . Kostya Staradubets, a spokesperson for Viasna, said the sentences imposed on the three activists were \"breaking our hearts\". . Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, he said: \"We knew that our three colleagues would get long prison terms but anyway it's still a shock, it's breaking our hearts, not only the [prison] terms are long but the conditions also very horrific.. \"We call [the conditions] torture actually because they're being held for several months in a 19th Century building, poorly lit cells with no fresh air, no sunlight, poor food, little or no healthcare.\" . Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said the sentencing was \"simply appalling\". . \"We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice and free them,\" she said. .

In awarding the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize to Mr Bialiatski, Ms Reiss-Anderson said the Belarusian government had \"for years tried to silence him\". . \"He has been harassed, he has been arrested and jailed, and he has been deprived of employment,\" she said. .
