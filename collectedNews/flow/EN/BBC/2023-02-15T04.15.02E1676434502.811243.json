        "content": "Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October's explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea.. \"I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,\" Olesya tells the BBC, \"reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened.\" . She had also shared a friend's post about the war.. Then the drama began.. \"I was talking on the phone to my mother,\" Olesya recalls, \"when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor.\". Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison.. \"I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,\" Olesya says. \"I'd seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn't paid much attention and continued to speak out.\". A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia's official list of terrorists and extremists. . \"When I realised I'd been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,\" recalls Olesya. . Under the rules of her house arrest she's banned from talking on the phone and going online.. Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: \"Big Brother is watching you.\". It appears that in Olesya's case, it wasn't Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students.. \"A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,\" Olesya says, \"about how I was against the 'special military operation'. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities.\". The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat.. In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing \"provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud\". . \"First let's try to discredit her. If she doesn't get it, let the security services deal with it.\". \"Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,\" someone else writes.. Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat.. It's one year since the Kremlin launched its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate \"true patriots from scum and traitors\".. Since then, across Russia .  against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues. . Public criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people's criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don't support it, at the very least you're expected to stay silent. If you don't stay silent, there's a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading \"false information\" about the military and \"discrediting\" the army.. In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: \"Being a warrior means living forever.\" . The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments. . \"People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they're sick in the head,\" Konstantin tells me. \"They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder.\" . \"I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,\" Ekaterina tells me. . But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn't that harsh? I ask.. \"People should use their brains,\" Ekaterina replies. \"If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they're patriots, they need to abide by the law.\". Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement. . Olesya's T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with \"School Bus\" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities.. The judge rules to keep her under house arrest.. \"The state doesn't have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,\" Olesya says. \"But they can't put everyone in prison. At some point they'll run out of cells.\". ",

        "content": "Aerial footage reveals the extent of flooding in Hawke's Bay in New Zealand's east. Chris Hipkins' government earlier declared a state of emergency - only the third in New Zealand's history.. At least three people have died. About a third of the country's population of five million live in affected areas.. On Wednesday, the cyclone weakened and moved away from the North Island. But many people remain displaced.. Some were forced to swim from their homes to safety after rivers burst their banks. Others have been rescued from rooftops.. About a quarter of a million people are without power. Falling trees have smashed houses, and landslides have carried others away and blocked roads.. The storm's damage has been most extensive in coastal communities on the far north and east coast of the North Island - with areas like Hawke's Bay, Coromandel and Northland among the worst hit.. Communications to one town in the region have been completely cut after a river burst its banks.. Civil defence authorities in the region said they couldn't cope with the scale of the damage. Australia and the UK have pledged to help.. On Wednesday, two deaths were confirmed in the Hawke's Bay area.. The authorities also said they found the body of a missing firefighter who had been caught in a landslide in Muriwai, west of Auckland. A second firefighter involved was critically injured, rescue agencies said.. Marcelle Smith, whose family lives in a cliff-front property in Parua Bay on the east coast of the North Island, told the BBC she had fled inland with her two young children on Monday night.. Her husband remained behind to set up protections for their home. Some embankments set up had already been washed away and they were still battling wild weather on Tuesday.. \"We are trying to do everything we can to protect what we have put our lives into. It's man versus nature at this point,\" she told the BBC.. Local media reported that some residents in Hawke's Bay had to swim through bedroom windows to escape as waters flooded their homes. People have been warned they could be without power for weeks.. Aerial pictures of flooded regions showed people stranded on rooftops waiting for rescue.. The vast scale of the damage includes uprooted trees, bent street lights and poles, and row after row of flooded homes.. New Zealand's Defence Force released dramatic pictures of officials rescuing a stranded sailor, whose yacht was swept out to sea when its anchor cable snapped amid strong winds. . \"The severity and the damage that we are seeing has not been experienced in a generation,\" Mr Hipkins said on Tuesday.. \"We are still building a picture of the effects of the cyclone as it continues to unfold. But what we do know is the impact is significant and it is widespread.\". He has pledged NZ$11.5m (Â£6m; US$7.3m) in aid to support those affected by the disaster.. Declaring the national state of emergency on Tuesday morning, the Minister for Emergency Management, Kieran McAnulty, described the storm as \"unprecedented\".. The emergency order enables the government to streamline its response to the disaster. It has been applied to the Northland, Auckland, Tairawhiti, Tararua, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Hawke's Bay regions.. New Zealand has only previously declared a national state of emergency on two occasions - during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.. The government has attributed the scale of the disaster to climate change.. \"The severity of it, of course, [is] made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees,\" said climate change minister James Shaw.. \"We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.\". Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand just two weeks after unprecedented downpours and flooding in the same region, which killed four people.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Many Syrians are angry over the lack of aid for the war-torn nation especially to rebel areas, after last week's quakes in which more than 41,000 are known to have died in Turkey and Syria.. The UN and Syria's government on Monday agreed to use two more crossings.. The other one is at al-Rai, also on the Turkish border. The UN said the crossings would initially be open for three months.. Two powerful earthquakes struck the south-eastern regions of neighbouring Turkey on 6 February early in the morning, when many people were asleep.. Hopes of finding any more survivors are fading.. Countries with friendly relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, began flying supplies to government-controlled areas of Syria soon after the tremor.. But the opposition-controlled north-west - where some 4.1 million people were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive even before the disaster - received no aid deliveries from the UN via Turkey until Thursday.. The UN blamed damage to roads leading to the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which until now was the the only land route the UN Security Council has authorised it to use. . On Tuesday, the Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bassam al-Sabbagh, told the BBC's Radio 4's World Tonight programme that there would be be no discrimination over who was getting relief aid.. And he blamed the delay in opening more aid routes on what he called the \"terrorist opposition\" which controls the north-west.. In a separate development, on Monday night gunmen stormed a Syrian hospital caring for a baby girl who was born under the rubble of her family's earthquake-shattered home, a hospital official was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.. The official said the attackers beat the facility's director - but denied reports on social media that they had sought to kidnap the baby named Aya..  - whose name means miracle in Arabic - who was born under the rubble of a collapsed building in the north-western town of Jindayris. When she was rescued, she was still connected to her mother by her umbilical cord.. Her mother, father and all four of her siblings died in the quake.. ",
