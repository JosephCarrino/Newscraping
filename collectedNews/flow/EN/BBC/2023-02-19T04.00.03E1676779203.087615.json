        "content": "\"I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,\" he said.. But he hit out against those who he said wanted to extend the war to Russia itself in a bid to \"crush\" the nation.. The comments came as world leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference, which saw promises to speed up the supply of weapons to Kyiv and impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.. \"I do not think, as some people do, that we must aim for a total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil,\" Mr Macron told the paper Le Journal du Dimanche.. \"Those observers want to, above all else, crush Russia. That has never been the position of France and it will never be our position.\" . Addressing the conference in Munich on Friday, Mr Macron insisted that now was not the time for dialogue with Moscow.. But he did not shy away from mentioning peace talks as a final goal.. The president suggested that Ukrainian military efforts, supported by allies, were the only way to \"bring Russia back to the table and build a lasting peace\".. He also dismissed the prospect of regime change in Russia, saying similar efforts around the world as a \"total failure\".. Despite Mr Macron's comments, negotiations are a faraway prospect for Ukraine's leaders.. On Friday, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the decision to not invite Moscow to the Munich conference.. Russian leaders should not be invited to the table as long as the \"terrorist state kills, as long as it uses bombs, missiles and tanks as an argument for international politics\", he said.. President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out immediate talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, insisting there was \"no trust\" between the parties. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, he also .  to strike a peace deal with Moscow.. Mr Macron has previously been criticised by some Nato allies for sending what they believe are mixed messages on Ukraine.. Last June, he was .  for saying it was vital that Russia was not \"humiliated over its invasion\".. Mr Kuleba at the time responded that Russia - which was \"humiliating itself\" - needed to be put in its place.. ",

        "content": "Watch: US Vice-President Kamala Harris says those involved in atrocities \"will be held to account\". Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of \"gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation\" since its invasion.. World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine. . UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to \"double down\" on military support.. The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine, as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now. . The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches on 24 February. . Ms Harris told the conference that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held to account. . \"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity,\" she said. . The UN defines crimes against humanity as a \"widespread or systemic attack\" on a particular civilian population.. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion. . \"In the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity,\" Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, told the conference. . She cited \"barbaric and inhumane\" atrocities during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of bodies found .  shortly after the invasion and the . \"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served,\" Ms Harris said.. This video can not be played. Evidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha. Crimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).. But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.. Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.. The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had \"waged a genocidal war\" because it did not think Ukrainians \"deserve to exist as a sovereign nation\".. Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.. This conference has largely been a gathering of American and European leaders. It's a chance for them to reaffirm their support for Ukraine and demonstrate their resolve. . Rishi Sunak called for a new Nato charter to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security. Kamala Harris formally accused Russia of committing crimes against humanity. . But in the margins, there have been voices of doubt. . Take the prime minister of Namibia, Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila. She opposed sending more arms to Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution to the war. Her country, she said, had suffered recession, rising prices and disrupted supply chains. . It's opinions like that, widely held cross Africa, Asia and South America, that are concentrating transatlantic minds. . There is realisation among Western policymakers that almost one year after Russia's invasion, they need to remake the case for defending Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "The Democrat served one term from 1977 to 1981. He was defeated in his re-election bid by Ronald Reagan.. He has suffered from recent health issues, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.. \"He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,\" the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday.. Mr Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator, tweeted that he visited \"both of my grandparents yesterday.\". \"They are at peace and - as always - their home is full of love. Thank you all for your kind words,\" he said. . In 2021, Mr Carter and his wife Roslyn celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They have four children together.. Born in Georgia in 1924, Mr Carter entered politics in the 1960s when he was elected as state senator, before becoming the state's governor in 1971.. Five years later he defeated the sitting Republican President Gerald Ford to become the 39th commander-in-chief. . But problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter as president. . At home, an oil crisis produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures.. The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treaty returning the Panama Canal to Panama.. But in 1979 the last Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran in the aftermath. Mr Carter cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in response and introduced a trade embargo.. However, the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped as the US hostages were held for 444 days. His approval ratings took a further hit after an attempt to rescue the hostages failed and eight US military members were killed.. Iran then delayed the release of the hostages until after Ronald Reagan was sworn in.. Since leaving the White House, Mr Carter has remained active, carrying out humanitarian work with his Carter Center.. He led a delegation that sought to persuade military leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there.. He went on to gain an international reputation for his work in promoting human rights, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.. With Nelson Mandela, he founded The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights. . He also travelled extensively - well into his early 90s - and took part in annual trips to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity charity. . But the former president has also battled a host of health issues in recent years. In August 2015, Mr Carter had a small cancerous mass removed from his liver. . The following year he announced that he needed no further treatment, as an experimental drug had eliminated any sign of cancer. . However, he has frequently expressed a striking calmness when dealing with his health challenges. . \"I'm perfectly at ease with whatever comes,\" he said in 2015. \"I've had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.\". Mr Carter celebrated his most recent birthday in October in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife were born between the First World War and the Great Depression, and where they returned when he left office. .

        "content": "But now an investigation .  has revealed more details.. According to the investigation, M'Barki ran reports on a variety of subjects - luxury yachts in Monaco, a Sudanese opposition leader, allegations of corruption in Qatar - that had all one thing in common: they were planted by an Israel-based outfit specialising in 'news for hire'.. M'Barki has denied being paid to run the stories, but he admits to bypassing BFM's editorial checks.  . He says he was offered the reports by an intermediary and exercised his own professional judgment in selecting to use them.. But the investigators say they have evidence that the origin of the stories lies in the shadowy Team Jorge, an operation based in Tel Aviv and run by a former Israeli special forces officer whose real name is Tal Hanan.. According to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories, Team Jorge is one of several players in a growing world of disinformation mercenaries - private sector experts in intelligence who for a price will use the internet to damage an enemy's reputation or influence an election.. To get access to Team Jorge, three journalists from the Forbidden Stories consortium posed as potential clients seeking to shape opinion in French-speaking Africa on behalf of a major multinational. . After lengthy negotiation they finally arranged a face-to-face meeting and got what amounted to a sales pitch.. Hanan claimed to have intervened in more than 30 elections and to have access to email and social media accounts of prominent African figures.. Central to the Team Jorge offer was a platform called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (AIMS), which generates tens of thousands of fake identities with accounts on Facebook and Telegram. These accounts then spread the content of a campaign.. The investigators identified around 20 different international campaigns which they believed Team Jorge had organised. . Among the material being circulated on social media, they especially noticed two television news reports in French that purportedly ran on BFM.. After checking with BFM's management, they had confirmation: the reports were shown late at night on the channel, but without the knowledge of the editorial team. . At that point, on January 11, M'Barki was called in and suspended.. The first of the reports was on the EU's Russia sanctions, and their impact on the luxury yacht business in Monaco. . It was claimed that 10,000 jobs were at risk and that the industry had appealed to Prince Albert to intervene on their behalf. None of that has been proved.. The second report, broadcast in mid-December, was about a leafleting campaign in Paris accusing a former state prosecutor in Qatar of corruption.. When originally shown in the early hours of the morning, the reports would have gone almost unobserved.  . But that changed when they were picked up by social media and Team Jorge's massed avatars. Suddenly they were viral.. By seemingly planting the reports onto mainstream French television, the organisers would have immeasurably boosted the credibility of what would otherwise have been unsubstantiated gossip.  . It also would mean Team Jorge had evidence for future clients of its access to western media.. M'Barki's late night show also ran items on a Sudanese general who was considering running for the presidency, and a trade show in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. . In this second piece, the name of the territory was replaced by the politically-charged term Moroccan Sahara.. The area has been the subject of .  between Morocco and the indigenous Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front.. The people or organisations that ultimately commissioned the suspected campaigns remain a mystery, according to Le Monde and Forbidden Stories.  . Some may have been commissioned by governments, but most - like the yacht story - were probably ordered by private interests, the investigation concluded.. A worrying sign, the investigators say, of the growing \"Uberisation\" of the fake news business.. ",
