        "content": "Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. A local official says . .. But Deputy Mayor Oleksandr Marchenko said at the weekend that Russia had not yet gained control of the city.. Meanwhile Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner private army involved in the Russian campaign, .  amid apparent friction between his fighters and regular Russian forces. . He also says his representative had been barred from a Russian military headquarters.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin. . Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine it annexed last September after referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. Mr Zelensky said in a statement he had discussed Bakhmut with Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the country's ground forces.. \"They spoke in favour of continuing the defensive operation and further strengthening our positions in Bakhmut,\" the statement said.. The comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that Gen Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.. Most defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.. And at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were .  while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.. Gen Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".. \"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\".

        "content": "The charges included high treason and conspiracy to seize power. . Ms Tikhanovskaya said she was more worried about those with \"real\" - rather than absentee - jail terms.. She rejected the court's legitimacy.. \"Today I don't think about my own sentence. I think about thousands of innocents, detained and sentenced to real prison terms. I won't stop until each of them is released,\" she said on social media. . Viasna, a leading Belarusian human rights group, says nearly 1,500 political prisoners are currently held in the country. . The court also handed an 18-year sentence to one of Ms Tikhanovskaya's allies, former Belarusian culture minister Pavel Latushko, who is also in exile.. The decision comes just days after . , a move that prompted international condemnation.. Ms Tikhanovskaya stood in the August 2020 elections after her husband, former blogger and presidential candidate Sergei Tikhanovsky, was taken into custody. . . . She claimed victory in the polls, which were widely thought to be rigged, but was forced into exile with her children the day after the vote.. Mr Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and defied months of protests after the polls, arresting and jailing hundreds of opposition politicians and activists.. He is now a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has become increasingly reliant on Moscow for economic, political and military support.. He has hosted Russian forces and allowed them to use Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion of Ukraine.. ",

Authorities have released very little information about their investigations and announced no arrests, but they have accused Iran's \"enemies\" of using the suspected poisonings to undermine the clerical establishment. . Some Iranians believe the girls' schools are being targeted by hard-line elements to stop them receiving an education. . Others suggest the authorities may be punishing girls for their leading role in the nationwide anti-government protests that erupted in September.. The first known case was reported at a school in the Shia holy city of Qom on 30 November, when 18 schoolgirls fell ill and were taken to hospital. . Since then, a total of 127 schools in 25 of Iran's 31 provinces have been affected, . .. Students have said they smelled tangerine or rotten fish before falling ill. Many have suffered respiratory problems, nausea, dizziness and fatigue.. In his first public comments on the matter Ayatollah Khamenei called on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to \"seriously pursue the issue\".. \"The poisonings are a grave and unforgivable crime,\" he declared during a speech at a tree planting event in Tehran, adding that there would be \"no pardons\" if anyone was identified as a perpetrator and convicted.. Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei meanwhile warned that they could face the charge of \"corruption on earth\", which is punishable by death.. He also said special courts would be set up in each province to summon \"lie-spreaders and disrupters of public opinion in the case of the poisonings\". . Their remarks came a day after a series of suspected poisonings was reported in at least 15 cities and towns, with the south-western city of Ahvaz and the central city of Yazd said to have been worst affected..  that it said showed girls at Fatemieh Art School in the western city of Hamadan shouting: \"We don't want to die.\". , a woman in the northern city of Rasht said security forces had fired tear-gas at concerned mothers protesting outside the local education department.. On Saturday, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said that investigators had gathered \"suspicious samples\" at affected schools, but provided no details.. Health Minister Bahram Eynollahi meanwhile told a conference last Tuesday that research indicated that \"a kind of mild poison caused the intoxication\".. 1500 Tasvir tweeted on Sunday that it had \"received the results of 25 blood tests from poisoned students in different cities\" and that the \"MCV number in all of them is lower than normal\". .

The planned Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, dubbed \"Cop City\", is being built on land owned by the city in South River Forest. . After the clashes began, police locked down the area and a Swat team was in attendance. . Police said the group of protesters had used the peaceful demonstration as cover to \"conduct a coordinated attack on construction equipment and police officers\". . Several pieces of construction equipment were destroyed, the statement said. . \"The illegal actions of the agitators could have resulted in bodily harm. Officers exercised restraint and used non-lethal enforcement to conduct arrests,\" it added. . Opponents say the site is a vital green space for the city and describe it as the \"lungs of Atlanta\". . \"We call on all people of good conscience to stand in solidarity with the movement to stop Cop City and defend the Weelaunee Forest,\" a statement on the Defend The Atlanta Forest website said.. More protest events are planned for the days to come. Atlanta police say they have prepared a \"multi-layered strategy that includes reaction and arrest\". . In January there was a protest at the site after police killed a 26-year-old activist during a raid to clear the site. Demonstrators set fire to a police car and smashed windows. . Police say the activist fired first and injured a state trooper. Those opposing construction at the site have called for an independent investigation. . The 85-acre site (34 hectares) for the planned Atlanta Public Safety Training Center is designed to offer spaces for officers to practise shootouts and high-speed pursuits and for firefighters to practise battling blazes. .

        "content": "It is seen as an unparalleled political move by some of Israel's most strategically important reservists.. It is also a sign of growing opposition to the ruling nationalist coalition's plans to overhaul the legal system.  . One unnamed pilot told the Ynet news website that the squadron was \"signalling that we won't be prepared to serve a dictatorial regime\".  . Meanwhile, the national airline El Al said it had found a crew to fly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife to Italy for a planned state visit this week, following media reports its pilots had refused to fly the couple as part of the protests.  . And in a further sign of growing concern among Israel's military leadership, 10 former Israeli Air Force chiefs published an open letter calling on Mr Netanyahu to \"stop and find a solution\" to the crisis, given the level of protest among pilots and aircrews. . \"We are fearful over the consequences of these processes and the serious and tangible danger posed to the national security of the State of Israel,\" the letter said. . It follows an announcement last week by reservists in the elite 8200 intelligence unit, who also said they would not turn up for aspects of their reserve duty. . Israel's reservists are a key component of its military forces, often carrying out frontline roles, and in the case of the air force, regularly involved in active combat operations. . Over the weekend Mr Netanyahu responded, tweeting a black-and-white picture of his military ID from when was conscripted in 1967. . \"When we're called for reserve duty, we always turn up. We are one nation,\" he wrote. . Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also called for reservists to turn up for duty. . \"Any call for refusal harms the functioning of the IDF and its ability to carry out its tasks,\" he said. . Anti-government protests have continued to grow since Mr Netanyahu returned to power at the end of last year, leading the most right-wing, nationalist coalition in Israel's history and promising radical changes to Israel's legal system. . They include new laws which would give the government full control over nominating judges and would ultimately strip the Supreme Court of crucial powers to strike down legislation. . Most legal scholars say the reforms would effectively destroy the independence of the judiciary, while opposition figures describe the proposals as an attempted \"regime coup\" by the prime minister and his coalition.  . Mr Netanyahu is also on trial for corruption charges, which he denies, and opponents claim the legal reforms could help shield him from conviction.  . The proposals have sparked some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in Israel's history, with an estimated 150,000 people on the streets of Tel Aviv and tens of thousands more in protests elsewhere on Saturday. . During demonstrations last week, security forces used stun grenades and water cannon against protesters, after the far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, vowed to crack down on \"anarchists\" who blocked roads.  . Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts over-reaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election. . The pilot reservists are also reportedly . , without being able to argue that an independent judiciary in Israel is responsible for ultimately investigating wrongdoing by its forces.  . Human rights groups and Palestinian officials, however, have long dismissed Israel's own inquiries into its forces' conduct as a whitewash.  . Threatened boycotts by reservists in Israel are not uncommon, but the scale and seniority of those now involved is unprecedented.  . The pilots' protest adds to announcements by reservists in almost every combat or intelligence unit in recent weeks threatening not to serve if the government presses ahead with the highly controversial changes. . Army Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi has reportedly spoken to Mr Netanyahu, warning him that the action could harm the military's operational capabilities. . ",
