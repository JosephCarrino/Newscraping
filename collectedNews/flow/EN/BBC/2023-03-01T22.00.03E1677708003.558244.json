        "content": "Mr Lukashenko said his country \"fully supports\" a Beijing plan for ending the war in Ukraine.. China . , calling for the respect of national sovereignty.. The visit also comes days after China sent its top diplomat . China and Belarus \"expressed deep concern\" about the conflict and \"extreme interest in the soonest possible establishment of peace in Ukraine\", the Belarus state-run news agency Belta reported.. Mr Lukashenko has aided the Russian leader in his war in Ukraine, and observers have seen his trip to Beijing is another sign of China closing ranks with Russia and its allies.. The Belarus leader praised China's peace plan.. The 12-point document urges respect for \"the sovereignty of all countries\". It does not specifically say Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", an implicit criticism of Ukraine's Western allies.. Mr Lukashenko said he \"fully supports the initiative on international security you have put forward\", according to remarks released by his aides.. Political decisions \"should be aimed at first and foremost preventing a slide into a global confrontation that will see no winners\", he told Mr Xi.. China's peace plan was met with general distrust in the West.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed with some parts of it and said it was a sign of China's willingness to engage. Beijing has so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit. . The Chinese leader called for discarding \"all Cold War mentality\", according to a Chinese readout of the meeting with Mr Lukashenko.. Mr Xi added that countries \"should stop politicising\" the world economy \"do things that will aid a ceasefire, cessation of war, and a peaceful resolution\".. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. Mr Lukashenko's three-day visit comes after China upgraded the status of its relationship with Belarus in September, several months into the Ukraine war.. Chinese foreign ministry statements have described their ties as an \"all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership\", a rare term that has been used for only one other country - Pakistan.. This means Belarus ranks very highly in China's hierarchy of international relationships, just below Russia, according to a BBC Monitoring analysis. . Belarus has been a key ally from the very beginning of the conflict when it allowed Russia to use the Belarusian border with Ukraine as a launchpad for an attack on Kyiv, which eventually failed.. China, meanwhile, has attempted to appear neutral by stating support for both sovereignty and the right to national security, which are Ukraine and Russia's respective interests.. But Beijing has also refused to condemn Moscow and supported their war effort in indirect ways. Chinese state media has actively propagated Russian's view on the war, according to multiple analyses. . The Chinese government .  that it was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. . \"We do not accept the United States' finger-pointing on China-Russia relations, let alone coercion and pressure,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said when asked about the allegations.. Chinese firms have been accused of supplying dual-use technology - goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as drones and semi-conductor chips - to Russia.. ",

        "content": "His wife, Vanessa Bryant, sued, saying first responders photographed human remains as tradable \"souvenirs\".. Lawyers for LA County called the settlement \"fair and reasonable\".. \"Today marks the successful culmination of Mrs Bryant's courageous battle to hold accountable those who engaged in this grotesque conduct,\" lawyers for the plaintiff said in a statement on Tuesday.. \"She fought for her husband, her daughter, and all those in the community whose deceased family were treated with similar disrespect. We hope her victory at trial and this settlement will put an end to this practice.\". In a statement, Mira Hashmall, the lead trial counsel for Los Angeles County in the case, said all county-related litigation from the crash had been resolved.. She said the $28,850,000 settlement included the $16m awarded by a federal jury in August 2022 to Mrs Bryant in her invasion of privacy lawsuit against Los Angeles County. . \"We hope Ms Bryant and her children continue to heal from their loss,\" Ms Hashmall said.. Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the 26 January 2020 crash, separately settled with the county for nearly $20m, attorneys told US media on Tuesday. . In March 2021 Mrs Bryant shared the names of four sheriff's deputies she said had distributed \"gratuitous photos of the dead children, parents, and coaches\", who had been travelling to a basketball game.. She said the pictures, including those of her 13-year-old daughter Gianna, were taken and shared \"for no reason other than morbid gossip\".. Mrs Bryant testified at the trial that she had read in media reports how photos of the crash were shown at a pub by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. . \"I live in fear of my daughters being on social media and these popping up,\" she told the court.. California has since passed a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who die at the scene of an accident or crime.. The aircraft in the crash that killed Bryant - a Sikorsky S-76B - went down into a hillside outside the city of Calabasas.. Conditions were foggy when the flight took off, and local police had grounded their helicopters due to the poor weather.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "While the US now discounts that theory, no other explanation has been given. . The phenomenon gets its name from Cuba's capital, where the first case was detected. . On Wednesday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released an unclassified assessment reflecting the view of seven government agencies which reviewed more than 1,500 \"anomalous health incidents\" across over 90 countries. . The victims have included intelligence officers, military and State Department staff and high-level aides to government figures such as Vice President Kamala Harris. . Of the seven participating agencies, five agreed that \"available intelligence consistently points against the involvement of US adversaries in causing the reported incidents\" and that it is \"very unlikely\". . Levels of confidence between participating agencies, however, varied. The report noted that two agencies have \"moderate-to-high\" confidence in the assessment, while three have \"moderate\" confidence. . \"One agency judges it is only unlikely a foreign adversary played a role and has only low confidence in this judgement,\" the assessment noted. . American personnel that have been struck by \"Havana Syndrome\" have reported  dizziness, headaches and an intense and painful sound in their ears. In addition to Cuba, cases have been reported in Geneva, Berlin and elsewhere. . A previous report released by the US intelligence community in early 2022 determined that while the majority of  cases could be explained by natural causes or stress, several dozen remained unexplained and could have been \"plausibly\" caused by a hidden device. . In a statement, CIA Director William Burns said that the findings \"do not call into question the experiences and real health issues that US government personnel and their family members - including CIA's own officers - have reported while serving our country\".. In an internal memo obtained by CBS, the BBC's US partner, the US defence department - which was not involved in the seven-agency assessment - also said that the symptoms of Havana Syndrome are \"genuine and compelling\". . At a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that \"the book is never fully closed\" when it comes to intelligence assessments. . \"An assessment like this is an assessment based on the best information available to us at any particular time,\" he said, adding that any new information will be factored into future assessments about the disease. . Amid mounting public awareness, in 2021 US lawmakers began passing legislation aimed at supporting victims of the syndrome. The Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act was signed by President Joe Biden in October of that year. . State Department guidelines note that staff with confirmed brain injuries from the disease are eligible for over $180,000 (Â£150,000) each. It is not publicly known how much CIA staff who have fallen victim are eligible for. . ",

        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. At least 38 people died and dozens more were injured in the head-on collision between two trains near the city of Larissa on Tuesday night.. The front carriages of a passenger train involved were mostly destroyed.. \"We heard a big bang,\" said 28-year-old passenger Stergios Minenis, who jumped to safety from the wreckage.. \"We were turning over in the carriage until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables, fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over we were being burned. Fire was right and left,\" Mr Minenis was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. . \"For 10, 15 seconds it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped.\". The passenger train had been travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki when it crashed head-on with the other freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames, shortly before midnight local time. . It is being described as the worst train crash Greece has ever seen.. An investigation has been launched and police say they have arrested a local station master in Larissa. . Survivors have described the chaotic scenes after the crash, with one shaken passenger telling the BBC: \"People were panicking and screaming - some people were afraid they were going to die.\". Giannis Antonoglou, who escaped from the fifth compartment of the passenger train, said the windows suddenly smashed and \"we ended up being tilted 45 degrees as if about to tip\". . Another told Skai television he was lucky to escape his carriage \"fairly quickly\", but \"in other wagons, they did not manage to get out, and one wagon even caught fire\".. Some passengers said they were forced to break carriage windows with their bodies or luggage to escape the burning wreckage. . Angelos Tsiamouras told Greek broadcaster ERT the crash had felt like an earthquake, and he smashed the train window using his suitcase. \"We broke the windows with our backs,\" another unnamed passenger said. . One survivor, Lazos, told the newspaper Protothema: \"I wasn't hurt, but I was stained with blood from other people who were injured near me.\". Many of the 350 passengers on board the passenger train were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis said the exact number of dead is still unclear, amid reports there are 20-25 people still missing. However, officials say some may have left the scene without being accounted for.. Mr Karamanlis later resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage reached 1,300C (2,370F), which \"makes it hard to identify the people who were inside\".. One woman told Greek channel ANT1 her 23-year-old cousin, who was speaking to his mother on the phone from the passenger train shortly before the line cut, is still missing. . \"His mother has been looking for him since dawn,\" she added.. Sixty-six people were being treated in hospital for their injuries, including six admitted to intensive care.. This video can not be played. It smells like burning metal and plastic - BBC reporter at scene of fatal crash. \"It was a very powerful collision,\" the regional governor of the Thessaly region, Kostas Agorastos, told state-run television.. He said the first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two carriages caught fire and were \"almost completely destroyed\".. \"They were travelling at great speed and one (driver) didn't know the other was coming,\" the governor added.. As daylight broke, dozens of rescue workers aided with cranes were lifting the charred remains of the derailed carriages to search for more victims. . \"I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It's tragic. Five hours later, we are finding bodies,\" an exhausted rescuer emerging from the wreckage told AFP news agency. . Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who visited the disaster scene on Wednesday, has vowed to find out what happened and ensure it never happens again.. Police say they have charged the 59-year-old station master for the city of Larissa with causing deaths by negligence and grievous bodily harm by negligence. The station master, who is in charge of signalling, has denied both charges and blamed the accident on a technical fault.. Three days of national mourning have been declared. .

        "content": "His main rival Atiku Abubakar polled 29%, and Labour's Peter Obi 25%. . Their parties had earlier dismissed the poll as a sham, and demanded a rerun.. Mr Tinubu urged them to accept the result, but Labour said it was taking legal action to annul his victory. . Mr Tinubu is one of Nigeria's richest politicians, and based his campaign on his record of rebuilding the biggest city, Lagos, when he was governor.. He was nevertheless defeated in the city by Mr Obi, a relative newcomer who mobilised the support of many young people, especially in urban areas, shaking up the country's two-party system.. Mr Tinubu won most other states in his home region of the south-west, where he is known as a \"political godfather\" - for helping to put others into office.. He campaigned for the presidency under the slogan: \"Emi lo kan\", which means \"It's my turn\" in Yoruba.. Scenes of celebration have been reported in Mr Tinubu's strongholds in the south-western states. . Traditional drummers lined the streets, beating their drums for excited dancers in Osun, while supporters marched to a live band in Ekiti. . Some partied into the early hours in Lagos, even though he was defeated by Mr Obi in the city. . The normally bustling streets of Lagos are relatively quiet on Wednesday, the usual rush-hour traffic has not been seen and some shops, businesses and banks have not opened.. Life has returned to normal in places that did not support Mr Tinubu, like the capital, Abuja, and Kano in the north.. In north-eastern Adamawa state, home to Mr Abubakar, there is an air of disappointment in the main city Yola, but grudging acceptance that after several attempts for the presidency, it is time for the former vice-president to move on.. Mr Obi's stronghold in south-eastern Anambra state, where he once served as governor, is quiet but there is an underlying sense of bitter anger. Many feel frustrated at what they see as a fraudulent electoral process.. This video can not be played. Who is Nigeria's president-elect?. In his acceptance speech, Mr Tinubu called for reconciliation.. \"I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants to let us team up together. It is the only nation we have. It is one country and we must build it together,\" he said in a televised speech.. He added that they had the right to challenge the results in court but said that the lapses in the election \"were relatively few in number and were immaterial to affect the outcome of this election\".. At a news conference later, Mr Obi's running-mate Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed urged his supporters to stay calm.. Labour's lawyers were \"putting the papers together\" to challenge Mr Tinubu's victory in court, he added.. According to official results, voter turnout was 27%, one of the lowest since the end of military rule in 1999.. With about 8.8 million votes cast for Mr Tinubu, he was the choice of less than 10% of the record 93 million Nigerians who registered to vote, helped by a divided opposition.. A newly introduced electronic voting system seems to have eliminated the ballot-stuffing that happened in the past and helped present a more accurate picture of the voting population.. But given that 87 million people actually collected their voter cards before election day - which was not an easy process and involved queuing for hours - it is more likely that problems on voting day, rather than voter apathy, was responsible for the low number of ballots cast.. Many potential voters left polling stations without casting their ballots after voting did not start on time in many places. . In some opposition strongholds, voting did not take place at all and there were also cases of ballot-box snatching and voter intimidation in southern states such as Rivers, Lagos and Delta.. President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two terms in office, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east to a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. Mr Tinubu now has the task of solving these problems, among others, in Africa's most populous nation and biggest oil exporter.. After fighting military rule in Nigeria, escaping into exile and being one of the founding members of the country's democracy in 1999, Mr Tinubu will feel that he was destined to become president.. He was always the favourite to replace Mr Buhari - whom he helped become president - and the hurdles he has surmounted to get here will make this an even sweeter win for him.. He was not expected to win the party primary, yet he won.. Many said his decision to go with another Muslim as a running mate would prove an obstacle, but it was not.. Previously all major parties have split their presidential tickets with a Christian from the south and a northern Muslim in order to achieve broad support across this vast nation of 210 million people.. He will now have to prove that he can hit the ground running and that he is still the same formidable force who built modern Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.. Mr Tinubu, known as \"Jagaban\" by supporters, will now be looking at unifying a country that is retreating into regional lines and religious blocs, as the election results show.. While he met the 25% requirement in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to show he was nationally accepted, the nature of the win indicates the absence of a truly national party.. Mr Obi won in Christian-dominated states and former strongholds of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the south, while the PDP support shrank back into its northern heartlands. . ",
