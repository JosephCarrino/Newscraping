        "content": "It follows four attacks across Afghanistan on Thursday - all claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). . The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a key security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.. No-one has admitted carrying out Friday's attack in Kunduz, which came as worshippers gathered to pray. . A local shopkeeper told AFP news agency: \"The sight at the mosque was horrifying.\". The explosion was similar to Thursday's bomb which tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 31 people  and wounding 87. . Thursday's attack in Kunduz killed four people and wounded 18. . Admitting those attacks, IS said it was part of an ongoing global campaign to \"avenge\" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman.. Bomb attacks in Afghanistan have declined considerably since the Taliban came to power last August following the withdrawal of US and other Western forces after 20 years in the country.. IS does not control any territory in Afghanistan, but since their rivals, the Taliban, took power, they have been carrying out attacks in areas where they previously never had a presence, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Pakistan.. Sufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in the region for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.. IS militants also target the Taliban, with whom they have a fierce rivalry.. Responding to the attacks, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described the perpetrators as \"evil elements\", adding \"serious efforts are being made to arrest and punish them\".. The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Ramiz Alakbarov said the attacks this week were \"a painful reminder of the insecurity and dangers facing the Afghan people daily\". . \"The indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, which has already caused more than 100 civilian casualties this week, is unacceptable and must cease immediately,\" Mr Alakbarov said in a statement on Friday. .

        "content": "Transnistria is a small Russian-backed region that borders Ukraine. . It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned. . Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were \"looking into\" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. . Moldova has summoned Moscow's ambassador over the comments. . Meanwhile, a senior EU official has told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. . It comes as the BBC learned that European Council President Charles Michel has highlighted Russia's \"miscalculations and losses\" in its invasion of Ukraine to President Vladimir Putin during a phone call on Friday. . A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. . A small detachment of around 1,500 Russian troops has been stationed in the region since 1995 as part of a truce agreement. . Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region. . \"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,\" Gen Minnekayev said. . Mr Putin made similar claims about the alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine before launching the invasion on 24 February. . Ukraine's defence ministry denounced Gen Minnekayev's comments as Russian \"imperialism\". . In a statement posted to Twitter, Ukrainian officials said Russia had \"acknowledged that the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine\".. Later the Moldovan foreign ministry released a statement saying it viewed the comments \"as unfounded and contradicting Russia's position in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country within internationally recognised borders\".. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is planning on holding a series of sham independence referendums in occupied regions to create a series of pro-Russian breakaway states. . \"If they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know this is not to help you,\" he warned.. \"This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. This is the reality. Be careful.\". A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defence ministry said that referendums were planned in Kherson and occupied areas around Zaporizhzhia in the coming weeks. . Oleksandr Motuzianik claimed the polls will coincide with the forced conscription of some men into the Russian military. . What did Putin do before he came to power?.

        "content": "A spokesperson for the boxing Hall of Famer confirmed Tyson had an \"incident with an aggressive passenger\" who was \"harassing him\".. Police were dispatched and temporarily detained two individuals. . One person was treated at San Francisco International Airport for non-life threatening injuries.. \"That subject provided minimal details of the incident and refused to co-operate further with the police investigation,\" a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement. . Both people were released \"pending further investigation\". The department did not identify either of the individuals involved.. The attack occurred on board a JetBlue fight on Wednesday night, before it set off from San Francisco to Florida.. The video - published by TMZ - does not show the entirety of the altercation and a water bottle is not visible in the footage. . According to TMZ, Tyson had agreed to take a picture with the passenger at the beginning of the flight. But the man continued to harass Tyson, despite requests from Tyson to \"chill\".. The video of Tyson striking his fellow passenger includes audio of another person calling \"hey Mike, Mike\", seemingly trying to calm him while another person tries to push Tyson away. . It then shows the passenger's forehead, which appears bloodied. . The San Francisco Police Department said it was \"are of video that possibly captured the incident\", and was sent to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office which has jurisdiction over the investigation. . Tyson is no stranger to violence inside and outside the ring.. In 1992, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison. In 1997, he was disqualified from a fight after biting off part of his opponent's ear. . And in 1998, Tyson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour assault following a car accident in Maryland.. Since February 2021, more than 7,000 unruly passenger incidents have been reported in the US - though 70% of them involved masking rules, according to the Federal Aviation Administration..

        "content": "In reality, though, little here could be described as normal. Normality ended on 24 February when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine for his \"Special Military Operation\".. I have experienced Communist Russia. I have lived through post-Soviet Russia. Now the world's largest country has metamorphosed again. . Let me take you on a tour of \"Special Military Operation Russia\".. I get in the car to drive to the supermarket. By force of habit, I switch on the radio. It's tuned to 91.2 FM - once the home of Radio Echo of Moscow. Echo was my favourite Russian radio station - a reliable source of news and information. . But in recent weeks all independent Russian news outlets have either been blocked or shut down.  Broadcasting now on 91.2 FM is state-run Radio Sputnik, which backs the Russian offensive in Ukraine.. Driving along the Garden Ring, I pass a theatre which has erected on its façade a giant Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation. There's another Z outside the headquarters of Russian Railways. I overtake a lorry that has a Z sticker on the side. In recent weeks Zs have been graffitied on the front doors of Kremlin critics.. At the shopping mall, business is far from booming. Many of the shops - international brands - have shut down. Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine, hundreds of foreign companies have suspended operations in Russia. . In the supermarket, the shelves are full. Last month's sugar shortage in Russia - the result of panic buying - appears to have been resolved. But the range of products seems smaller than before. And over the last two months prices have shot up. . Outside the shopping centre, I get chatting to Nadezhda, a doctor. . \"Prices are so high, it's impossible to survive now on my salary,\" Nadezhda tells me. . \"But the hardest thing of all is living in a society that doesn't want to know the truth about events in Ukraine. People are too busy worrying about their mortgage payments, paying off their debts. They're not interested in what's going on around them. But I think that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible. I'm ashamed to be Russian.\". I drive to the Moscow engineering institute where, 30 years ago, I used to teach English. . Back in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism, my students here were full of hope that Russia and the West would forge a lasting friendship and partnership; that the future would be peaceful and prosperous. . That didn't work out.. \"We'll overcome all our difficulties. After sunset always comes the dawn,\" says Denis, a student, outside the institute. . \"But I support our troops. They are our soldiers. I am obliged to support my country come what may.\". My final destination is the giant war museum that celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two - a glorious victory, achieved at enormous human cost. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. . What I find disturbing is how the \"Special Military Operation\" has found a place in this museum, how it's being honoured here. . On the museum's website, the spelling of the word \"museum\" has been altered to feature the letter Z. In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring \"Putin is My PreZident\". . And the museum is currently hosting an exhibition about Nazis in Ukraine. That helps to cement the Kremlin's bogus claim that the Russian army is liberating Ukraine from Nazism. . This is \"Special Military Operation Russia\" - a parallel universe, Orwellian, where invasion is liberation, where aggression is self-defence and where critics are traitors.. It feels like the Russia I have known for the last 30 years has gone.. This video can not be played. What did Putin do before he came to power?. Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars.

Russian troops control most of Mariupol after weeks of bombardment and fighting, but some Ukrainian forces remain in a sprawling steelworks in the city. President Putin has abandoned plans to storm the Azovstal plant and instead told troops to seal it off.. The alleged mass grave is near a village called Manhush about 20km (12 miles) west of Mariupol. Maxar said there were four sections of linear rows about 85m long. . The BBC has not independently verified the images.. Mariupol city council earlier issued its own statement accusing the Russians of burying civilians at the same location.. The council said the Russians were digging trenches and \"using dump lorries to bring the bodies\" and provided its own aerial image of the site, which it said was \"already twice as large as the nearby cemetery\".. The city's mayor Vadym Boichenko says tens of thousands of civilians may have been killed in Mariupol . Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations by Ukraine and its Western allies that Russian troops and top Kremlin politicians are responsible for mass killings of civilians.. Earlier this month, Maxar images of the town of Bucha outside Kyiv appeared to show bodies of civilians lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town as part of a withdrawal from northern Ukraine.. The image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, contradicted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claim that footage of bodies in Bucha had been \"staged\" after the Russians withdrew.. Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said that least 300 civilians were killed in the town.. What did Putin do before he came to power?. Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars.
