The report also said traffickers were using international postal services more often to get drugs to consumers.. \"Globally, the use of parcel and courier services increased significantly during the Covid-related lockdown due to restrictions on passenger flights,\" the .  report said.. It noted a rise in West African countries in the use of \"well established, globally operating postal services as well as smaller shopping companies\" used to smuggle quantities of cocaine to Europe and beyond.. Overall, the the report found Europe and North America are the largest markets for cocaine, followed by South and Central America and the Caribbean.. While the report said the markets in Africa and Asia were \"still limited\", the UN's Ghada Waly said the potential for the market to expand there was a dangerous reality.. Production increase was the result of an expansion in the cultivation of coca bush, as well as improvements in converting coca into powdered cocaine, the report found.. It added the outbreak of Covid-19 had a \"disruptive\" effect on drug markets as international travel was severely curtailed.. Demand for cocaine slumped as nightclubs and bars were shut during the pandemic lockdowns.. \"However, the most recent data suggests this slump has had little impact on longer-term trends,\" the report says. \"The global supply of cocaine is at record levels.\". In the UK, the report says there has been a \"significant increase\" in seizures of cocaine in the \"fast parcel and postal modes\".. Interceptions by law enforcement have also been on the rise - at a higher speed than production, the report outlines.. Other key findings include: . Reacting to the report, UN's chief of research and trend Angela Me said the supply of cocaine has risen in South America as criminal groups have taken control of areas previously run by Colombia's largest rebel group - . She said this has led to competition among groups - including some foreign groups - which has increased the production.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jet. The US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.. Russia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.. It was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.. The BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute. . On Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\" . He said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public. . Mr Austin previously described Russia's actions as .  - and the edited video released appears to back that up. . A feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.  . In the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.. When the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape. . Russia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud. . The US insists the drone was being operated in international air space. However, Moscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine. . Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had \"violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation\". . In a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary .  the remnants of the drone.. On Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.. Senior Washington official John Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".. That message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.. ",

The deputy speaker of Ukraine's parliament Olena Kondratyuk said she hoped more countries would follow.. Other Nato countries are considering sending the Soviet-era planes, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.. Ukraine has previously asked Western countries for modern fighter jets, . The UK is training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard aircraft. But because of the long training times, it has warned that supplying Western jets would only ever be a long-term option.. President Biden has previously ruled out sending jets from the US to Ukraine.. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have around 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly ageing Mig-29s and Su-27s.. President Duda said Poland still had around a dozen Soviet-era Mig 29 aircraft in operation.. Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik told the BBC: \"We need them to strengthen our air defence systems and to help our army in the spring counter-offensive. . \"It's also a good sign to everybody that getting fighter jets to Ukraine is not something unspeakable or surreal - that this is something that can happen; that the only thing that is needed to make it happen is political will.\". Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, told the BBC the Polish jets would be used \"very efficiently by our air force\".. He said in the past 24 hours, the existing Ukrainian air force had carried out 16 air strikes on Russian personnel and equipment. But he stressed that Ukraine wanted \"fourth generation\" jets, such as F-16s.. \"They are more universal platforms, they are more capable and of course they will make Ukrainian air forces more efficient,\" he said.. Poland is a strong ally of Ukraine one of the largest suppliers of military equipment. It is currently replacing its old Soviet-era planes with newer American and Korean models.. ",

It's all normal citizens who voted,\" said leader Caroline van der Plas.. The BBB aims to fight government plans to slash nitrogen emissions harmful to biodiversity by dramatically reducing livestock numbers and buying out thousands of farms.. But its appeal has spread rapidly beyond its rural heartland, on a populist platform that represents traditional, conservative Dutch social and moral values. . Shocked by the scale of their success, Ms van der Plas told supporters that voters normally stayed at home if they lost faith in politics: \"But today people have shown they can't stay at home any longer. We won't be ignored any more.\" . A left-wing Green-Labour alliance is also on course to win 15 Senate seats, while Prime Minister Mark Rutte's four-party coalition is poised to fall back to 24 - down eight seats. . Turnout in Wednesday's vote, estimated at 57.5%, was the highest for years and the biggest loser of the night was the far-right Forum for Democracy party.. For rural voters, the main incentive for backing the BBB was to protest against cuts in nitrogen emissions, according to an Ipsos poll for public broadcaster NOS.. But voters also turned out in force for the Greens, and environmental groups warned that the Netherlands' problems were not going away. . \"Restoring nature is just as necessary today and tomorrow as it was yesterday,\" tweeted Natuurmonumenten.. The run-up to the vote was dominated by the sight of farmers' tractors on the streets of The Hague and outside the venue that hosted a pre-vote leaders' debate.. Commentator Ben Coates described the result as \"something of an earthquake in Dutch politics\". . Although their policies are very much focused on opposing the government's environmental policies, he told the BBC most people would characterise them as a right-wing, populist party that was quite anti-EU, anti-immigration and in favour of banning burkas for Muslims.. Standing before supporters on Wednesday night, Caroline van der Plas wore her trademark green nail polish and a ring featuring an upside-down Dutch flag, a symbol of the anti-government protests.. The daughter of an Irish mother and a Dutch father, she lost her husband Jan to pancreatic cancer as the protests took off in 2019. She is unlike any Dutch party leader - and for many voters, that is her appeal. . She had to step back from public campaigning last year because of death threats. She was told the same fate awaited her as Pim Fortuyn, a populist leader assassinated days before the 2002 Dutch general election.. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to farmers in the rural east, she sprang to her feet in mid-sentence to avoid a bee, explaining she had been stung as a toddler and had been terrified ever since..

        "content": "Video shows an official inspecting drums said to contain uranium ore. Ten drums containing the ore were found near the border with Chad, said the head of the forces' media unit.. The IAEA said it was \"actively working to verify\" media reports.. The agency sounded the alarm after a visit by its inspectors earlier this week to the undisclosed site.. The area was not in government-controlled territory.. Uranium is a naturally-occurring element that can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched.. The uranium which went missing could not be made into a nuclear weapon in its current state, but could be used as the raw material for a nuclear weapons programme, experts told the BBC.. In December 2003, under then-military ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya publicly renounced nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and agreed to restrict itself to the possession of ballistic missiles with a range of no more than 300km (186 miles).. But since Col Gaddafi was deposed in 2011, the country has been divided into competing political and military factions. . It is now split between an interim, internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, and another one in the east.. Neither is in control of the south, where the uranium was taken from.. Thursday's statement on finding the drums came from the self-styled Libyan National Army, the military force that backs the eastern Libyan administration.. The LNA is a coalition of military units, local, tribal and Salafi militias, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, a veteran officer who took part in the coup that brought Col Gaddafi to power in 1969.. Gen Khaled al-Mahjoub, commander of the LNA's communications division, said the containers of uranium had been found \"barely five kilometres [three miles]\" from where they had been stored in southern Libya.. The IAEA says the site had been difficult to reach in recent times.. Inspectors had wanted to visit the location last year, but the trip had to be postponed because of fighting between rival Libyan militias.. Many foreign governments and groups have been vying for influence in Libya since Nato-backed forces overthrew Col Gaddafi. They include Russia's Wagner Group and Islamic State militants.. The oil-rich country is largely lawless and has previously been described as an \"arms bazaar\".. In 2013, the UN reported that weapons smuggled out of Libya were fuelling conflicts in other parts of Africa and the Middle East.. The uranium that went missing was in a kind of concentrate known as \"yellow cake\" and \"doesn't really have any radiation in its current form\", said Scott Reocker from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a global security organisation working on nuclear issues.. He .  the concern was it could be used as \"feedstock\" for a nuclear weapons programme.. Mr Roecker also suggested that it could potentially be used for other purposes, such as nuclear energy, but pointed out that countries would normally buy material for that on the open market. . \"Perhaps it was stolen by someone who wants to make a profit out of this? There's a lot of scenarios around this,\" he said.. ",
