        "content": "The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv.. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials.. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a \"crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime\".. Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets.. \"We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,\" the official said.. \"We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them.\" . The US sanctions announced by the White House include:. Meanwhile the UK has announced . , including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow.. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases.. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not \"tolerate any indecisiveness\".. Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe \"war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses\" to back tougher sanctions. . He added that \"Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine\", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war.. Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; £833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion.. Some European member states, including Germany, are heavily reliant on Russian energy and had been reluctant to directly target the sector.. However, in a first, the . , which must be agreed by all 27 members. Europe buys around €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.3bn) worth of coal from Moscow every year. . Sentiment appeared to change after evidence of Russian war crimes emerged, with French President Emmanuel Macron joining calls for a ban on coal earlier this week. . The ban was suggested ahead of a range of sanctions set to be announced in coordination with the US and other G7 nations.. European member states are also expected to impose a \"full transaction ban\" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth €5.5 billion ($6bn; £4.59bn). . And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region.. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of \"waging a cruel and ruthless war\" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must \"sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point\". . But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a \"feeble response\" which is \"an invitation for more atrocities.\". \"Coal, four banks…a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,\" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter. .

In the US, where mid-term elections will be held in November, it has also become a major political issue, weighing on President Biden's support.. Executives warned that there was \"no quick fix\" to the problem. . They said their investments will raise output this year, but warned that staffing and supply issues stemming from the pandemic meant it is taking longer to start new production.. \"What can be done to ensure vital energy products remain available and affordable?\" asked Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil. . \"While there is no quick fix, the answer in the near-term, until there are more widely available and affordable alternatives, is straightforward. We need to increase the supply of oil and natural gas.\" . Energy prices were already increasing before Russia's invasion, as firms struggled to respond to disruption from the pandemic, which prompted a dramatic collapse in demand in 2020, followed by a faster-than-expected rebound. . Oil prices are up roughly 70% from a year ago, accelerating in recent months.. Following Russia's invasion, Western allies hit the country with severe sanctions, disrupting oil markets and raising concerns about their supplies. . The country is the world's second-largest exporter of crude oil, accounting for about 10% of global output.. The US and other members of the International Energy Agency have repeatedly tapped reserves to alleviate the crisis.. Just last week, the US pledged to release 180 million barrels of oil over the next six months, while allies are expected to announce plans to also release a further 60 million barrels from storage.. At the hearing, Democrats said oil firms were \"lining their own pockets\" as petrol prices have not fallen as rapidly as oil. . They pressed energy firms to halt stock buybacks and said the energy crisis should spur a faster turn to greener energy sources. . Republicans blamed policies backed by President Joe Biden for the higher costs, accusing him of an \"assault\" on the US energy industry with actions such as halting oil and gas leases on public lands.. \"High gas prices are a feature of President Biden's policies, not a bug,\" said Rep Cathy Morris, a Republican from Washington. \"Why? They want to usher in a green revolution.\". After questioning by Republicans, some executives said in their testimony that Mr Biden's push for green energy alternatives was chilling investment..

This land is ours. This is the last time a Tigrayan will live in the area.\". The western part of Tigray has been largely inaccessible to journalists and aid agencies since the war in Tigray erupted in November 2020 - and all lines of communication have been blocked.. It is an area where land and boundary disputes between neighbouring regions and ethnic groups have long caused tensions and resentments.. The conflict - which followed a fallout between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and Tigray's dominant political party - has provided an opportunity to settle old scores.. After the war began, Amhara's forces, along with their allies in the Ethiopian army, quickly moved in, took control and a new administration was set up in western Tigray.. , is based on interviews with 423 people, mainly survivors of alleged abuses, and satellite images.. Amnesty and HRW says the evidence collected over a year shows that western Tigray has been the site of some of the worst atrocities committed during the 16-month war, by both sides - and has been largely ignored.. In the first days of the offensive, Jamila told how some Amhara militiamen came into her hair salon in the town of Dansha early one morning as she was working. The 27-year-old was raped in front of her children, aged seven and two: \"They said: 'You Tigrayans should disappear from the land west of Tekeze.'\" . This refers to the River Tekeze, which splits the western zone of Tigray from the rest of the region.. Once in control of western Tigray, interviewees said the new authorities put in place policies to push Tigrayans out, distributing leaflets with a 24-hour or 72-hour ultimatum to leave or be killed. . Three survivors told investigators about the massacre of about 60 Tigrayan men near the Tekeze River Bridge on 17 January 2021 - an incident that prompted many people to flee.. Militias rounded up Tigrayan men in the town of Adi Goshu and took about 60 of them to the Tekeze River where they were lined up in rows and shot.. Mesfin said: \"They shot all of us, me included. I was shot in my right shoulder and right hand. Bodies were falling one after the other.. \"I woke up at around 4am... I saw so many dead bodies around me,\" the 57-year-old said.. \"Some cow herders found me when I entered the forest. They took me to the people hiding in the forest. They treated me there, until I recovered... I lost my son and son-in law that day.\". The report also details how Tigrayan livestock, crops and homes were targeted and how security forces have tortured and deprived people of food.. \"This campaign of ethnic cleansing was conducted through a series of human rights abuses, including mass detention and torture, sexual violence, extrajudicial killings, denial of humanitarian aid and forced expulsion of Tigrayans,\" Amnesty researcher Fisseha Tekle told the BBC.. The two rights groups say that hundreds of Tigrayans remain unlawfully detained and have called for their immediate release.. They also want militias to be disarmed, officials linked to the abuses suspended and have called for an African Union-led international peacekeeping force to be deployed to western Tigray.. The conflict has forced millions of people to flee their homes - and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine.. The war is continuing - though a humanitarian truce was declared less than two weeks ago that has seen several lorries of food make it to the capital of Tigray for the first time in months..

Watson Farley & Williams said they would be \"remembering and honouring\" him.. The alarm was raised on Monday afternoon by the family's 15-year-old daughter after the landslide killed her father and younger brother, leaving her mother and older brother critically injured.. The teenage girl was said to be \"extremely distressed\" and is being kept in hospital under observation.. The two bodies were recovered from the mountains, near the popular walking spot of Wentworth Falls, about 60 miles (96km) from Sydney, at about 09:30 local time on Tuesday.. Tour guide Graham Chapman said landslides are common in the Blue Mountains and have been made more likely by recent heavy rain.. \"This beautiful family from England were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's so sad,\" he said.. \"Maybe another 50 metres either side or a delay during the day, this wouldn't have happened.\". Torrential rain has returned to the Blue Mountains. Thick bands of low cloud have moved in, obscuring buildings and bushland.  . As the rain beats down near Wentworth Falls, car headlights occasionally emerge from the mist. But this popular tourist destination is mostly quiet: walking tracks and some roads have been closed. . Months of heavy downpours are likely to have been a key factor in the tragedy involving the family of five from Britain. . They came on a day of rare sunshine in a year that's been dominated in much of eastern Australia by storms and floods. . In this World Heritage area, the ground is sodden and signs warn of the dangers of rockfalls and landslips. The earth and the famous sandstone cliffs have become saturated, and still it rains. . Landslides here are not uncommon - but rarely, if ever, have they devastated the lives of an entire family. . The family had set out on the hike on Monday in bright, sunny weather but the Blue Mountains had previously been lashed by weeks of heavy rain.. Mr Chapman said: \"I've seen so many landslides I couldn't tell you how many. But the thing is with landslides here in the mountains, you don't actually get to hear about them a lot because it's so remote.. \"Here in the mountains, it can change in the blink of an eye and sadly for the English family, that's exactly what happened the other day.\". He said he had cried when he heard the news of their deaths, adding: \"We've only just opened up our international borders, and to know that that family has come to our country and that this has happened on our soil, man, it's just heart breaking.\". The family are understood to be members of the Zoroastrian religion, . .. Zubin Appoo, president of the Australian Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales, said the accident was \"beyond tragic\". \"Everyone is shocked and so many in our community are reaching out to offer support in any way they can.\". Mr Appoo said tributes to the family were \"flooding in\", adding that the religion had a small and tight-knit global community.. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident was \"tragic\" and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open.. The Department of Environment and Heritage in the state said the area was closed to the public until further notice and a \"comprehensive review\" would be undertaken.. It said it had a \"world-class\" programme in place to assess the risks of incidents such as landslides but \"it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks\"..

He contracted coronavirus and died weeks after being admitted to hospital with pneumonia.. His death was finally confirmed by parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on Wednesday, after two reports earlier this year had been discounted. . Zhirinovsky was, he said, always in the thick of things: \"A man who deeply understood how the world works and foresaw a lot.\". Zhirinovsky's brand of clownish ultranationalism kept Russians shocked and entertained during more than 30 years of his political career. . In the early 1990s he claimed he dreamt of the day \"when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean\". In one of his final appearances before MPs, he said Russia would invade Ukraine and predicted almost to the day when it would happen.. \"At 04:00 on 22 February you'll feel [our new policy]. I'd like 2022 to be peaceful. But I love the truth, for 70 years I've said the truth. It won't be peaceful. It will be a year when Russia once again becomes great.\". His career was laced with similar threats to other countries, from the Baltics and Germany to Japan and the Middle East. He achieved international notoriety when he threw juice in the face of a political rival, Boris Nemtsov, during a TV debate.. Before he entered politics, he ran a Soviet state-approved Jewish cultural organisation. His Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was the country's first official post-communist political party and was widely viewed first as a Soviet stooge. Russians and the West were shocked when his party won Russia's first democratic elections in 1993.. Political commentator Konstantin Eggert labelled him \"the Kremlin's pocket nationalist and scandal-monger\". With hindsight, said Eggert, his success in 1993 was a precursor of the \"barbaric revanchism\" that had led to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.. Zhirinovsky told the BBC in 2018 that Ukraine was Russian territory: \"It's our territory; it's our people. It's part of our country.\". His career had declined in recent years - even though his party is widely viewed favourably by the Kremlin. . He secured a mere 5.6% of the vote in a 2018 presidential election that was marred by irregularities and by a ban on Russia's leading opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who is now in jail..

        "content": "Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, had claimed the \"Oh I\" hook in Sheeran's track was \"strikingly similar\" to an \"Oh why\" refrain in his own track.. After the ruling, Sheeran said such \"baseless\" claims \"are way too common\".. In a video on social media, he said there was now a culture \"where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim\".. He added: \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music.. \"Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year and there's only 12 notes that are available.\". This video can not be played. Shape of You was the UK's best-selling song of 2017 in the UK and is Spotify's most-streamed ever.. Judge Antony Zacaroli ruled that Sheeran had \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" Chokri's song.. He acknowledged there were \"similarities between the one-bar phrase\" in Shape of You and Oh Why, but said \"such similarities are only a starting point for a possible infringement\" of copyright.. After studying the musical elements, he said there were \"differences between the relevant parts\" of the songs, which \"provide compelling evidence that the 'Oh I' phrase\" in Sheeran's song \"originated from sources other than Oh Why\".. He added that there was only a \"speculative foundation\" for the defence's case that Sheeran had heard Chokri's song before writing Shape of You. \"I find, as a matter of fact, that he had not heard it,\" he said.. Sheeran wrote his chart-topping track with two collaborators, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, who all denied having previously heard Oh Why.. The case dates back to 2018, when the trio asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed the copyright of Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. That led to an 11-day trial in London last month.. This ruling will come as a huge relief to Ed Sheeran, who took the unusual step of pre-emptively suing Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue in 2018 in an attempt to clear his name. . He was stung by the accusation that he'd deliberately copied another writer's work without giving them credit. On the witness stand, the star was often terse and abrupt as he explained how, in several other instances, he shared royalties with writers who inspired him. Even on Shape of You, he protested, some of the profits went to the writers of TLC's No Scrubs.. He later sang Nina Simone's Feeling Good and Blackstreet's No Diggity on the stand in an attempt to prove the melody he was accused of stealing was commonplace in pop music.. Chokri was more emotional. He said he felt \"robbed\" by an artist he respected, and that he wished the trial had never come to court. However, he remained adamant that Sheeran had heard and copied his song.. In the end, the judge disagreed. In order for copyright infringement to be proved, Chokri needed to prove that Sheeran had listened to his song - otherwise the similarities would just be coincidence. But Mr Justice Zacaroli said Chokri's team had failed to establish that Oh Why had ever graced Sheeran's speakers. . As a star who has faced his fair share of copyright claims, Sheeran will presumably hope this verdict makes future litigants think twice. . The Shape of You songwriters took legal action in 2018 after the track's royalties were frozen when Chokri and O'Donoghue asked the Performing Rights Society (PRS) to add them to the hit's credits as co-writers.. Shape of You earns Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon about £5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments having being frozen due to the dispute.. In his ruling, Mr Justice Zacaroli said Sheeran and his collaborators were justified in thinking the request from Chokri and O'Donoghue to be named as co-writers \"was a tactic designed to extract a settlement\".. After the initial legal action, Chokri and O'Donoghue launched a counter-claim alleging copyright infringement.. In a joint statement after the judgement, Sheeran, McDaid and McCutcheon said their mental health and creativity had suffered as a result of the case, as well as their wallets.. \"There was a lot of talk throughout this case about cost,\" they said. \"But there is more than just a financial cost.

        "subtitle": "Vladimir Zhirinovsky has died in hospital, after a career built on fiery remarks and absurd antics.",
        "content": "Down the main street from the roundabout at the entrance to the town there is a massive amount of damage. Destroyed and burnt-out buildings, homes turned to rubble, the twisted wreckage of cars, and then more collapsed buildings.. Borodyanka, which is not far from the border with Belarus and was on the main axis of the Russian advance on Kyiv, has been very heavily shelled.. It is not the kind of shelling that happens in a couple of bombardments. This takes application.. Several witnesses told the BBC that Russian troops stopped attempts to dig survivors out of wrecked buildings, threatening people who wanted to do so at gunpoint.. Ukrainian officials say that the Russians may have committed worse atrocities in Borodyanka than in Bucha, where bodies of men who looked to have been summarily killed were found lying in the street after the Russians pulled out, and several hundred other bodies were in a mass grave.. At the moment, though, the extent of what was done to civilians in Borodyanka during the Russian occupation is not yet clear. . The reason is that the rubble of bomb sites has not yet been moved. Those in the town believe that corpses of civilians are lying under them, but the number is not known. . The worst killing in Borodyanka might have come when several large blocks of flats were destroyed.. In a line of big cream-coloured buildings, several have been flattened. The fire-blackened gaps that they occupied are like missing teeth.. Tons of concrete and steel collapsed into the cellars under the flats. Several people said dozens of civilians were lying dead under the rubble. The police said it could be hundreds. They are waiting for cranes and heavy lifting gear to start moving huge amounts of rubble to recover bodies.. Dmytro Stashevskyi, a middle-aged man, is lucky to be alive. I met him when he was cleaning up a smashed and looted shop he rented out as a pharmacy.. His family left Borodyanka on 24 February when the Russians invaded. Dmytro stayed on to safeguard their property. The Russians were moving tanks and men through the town, so with his neighbours, he spent much of his time in the cellar under their building, day as well as night.. By the evening of 1 March he decided that he had to sleep somewhere less exposed to the Russians, so went to another shelter on the edge of town.. When he returned in the morning the building was rubble and the cellar where he had been staying with friends and neighbours was filled with twisted concrete and steel.. \"I came back at 08:30 in the morning and the apartment was already destroyed. My mum, my wife and daughter were all praying for me. Before it all happened, there was talk of Russian tank columns moving through the city and shooting at everything. I didn't believe it at first, but then I saw them shooting at civilian houses.\". Dmytro's wife Svetlana was trying to clear up his mother's destroyed flat in the building next door, which was still standing. She said the Russians stopped attempts to rescue any survivors.. \"They were all our neighbours\", she said. \"Shortly after the attack, people nearby heard some voices, Russian soldiers stopped them digging. They threatened to shoot if they tried.\". \"There are a lot of people left under the rubble,\" confirmed another woman, Maria, who was busy sorting mirrors and pictures that could be salvaged and throwing the rest into a skip behind her apartment block. \"My soul hurts. I knew all those people. We knew they were there from the first day, but they wouldn't let us get them out.\". Maria and many others told us that Russian troops looted their property.. The Russians \"stole everything that glittered,\" she said. \"They even took my lingerie. They beat everything, they gutted everything… it's all smashed.\". Many people left Borodyanka when the invasion began on 24 February. A few who have come back were walking around the ruins, dazed and distressed by what they were seeing.. Svitlana Gontar, who had just returned on Tuesday morning, sobbed as she saw what had become of her hometown.. \"It was so green. It was really nice. Kids studied here. We had three schools, a technical and a music college. Now, we don't have anything. Children have lost their childhood, their memories, everything.\". Outside the golden-domed Ukrainian Orthodox church, a local priest, Father Dmytro, was supervising the distribution of bread. He said he had witnessed Russian snipers killing civilians.. \"It was the 2 March near the petrol station. We were driving along, followed by two civilian cars. They just shot them - it was an execution.\". \"Since the Russians left, we have tried to provide humanitarian aid - mostly supplies from western Ukraine. But it has to be food that will keep. Most people still don't have any power or heat.\". The biggest bomb sites in Borodyanka could only have been hit by air strikes or ballistic missiles. The laws of war state civilians are protected and killing them is a crime unless they are involved with military action.. Unless it can be proved that the blocks of flats were military sites, then their destruction and the death of the hundreds whose bodies local police fear lie underneath, could amount to a war crime.. Reports of actions by Russian forces in Ukraine that could be crimes of war are accumulating. One question is what redress, if any, will be available for victims and their families.. The best recent example was the war crimes tribunal in The Hague that prosecuted some of the worst perpetrators in the wars of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. That was authorised by the UN Security Council.. But Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member, so that avenue is likely to be closed for Ukraine.. Father Dmytro has no doubt about what Russia's actions in his country amount to. \"[The Russians] did everything possible to destroy the country of Ukraine. This was not a war between armies - this war was against the entire country of Ukraine.\". This video can not be played. The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell.

        "subtitle": "Energy bosses warn there is \"no quick fix\" to the higher energy costs hitting households.",
        "content": "The US is also planning more sanctions.. And UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for a \"tough new wave\" of sanctions from G7 and Nato ministers.. She said her Japanese counterpart had agreed the international community had to increase pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin \"and his war machine with further co-ordinated sanctions\".. EU officials had earlier indicated the focus would be on enforcing existing measures. . But revelations of atrocities, with hundreds of bodies of civilians found in towns abandoned by Russian troops, have given added impetus for new measures. . \"The new sanctions will probably be adopted tomorrow,\" French European Affairs Minister Clément Beaune said on Tuesday.. Ms von der Leyen said the proposals included:. The EU was also working on other sanctions including on imports of Russian oil, she said.. This is the fifth set of EU sanctions so far. Earlier measures have ranged from individuals including Vladimir Putin and hundreds of Russian MPs, to the financial and energy sectors. The 27 member states plan to cut use of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year and then make Europe entirely independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030.. There is an active debate in Germany on imposing a total embargo on Russian energy, but the government warns it would trigger a recession and mass unemployment and for the moment it has ruled it out. \"If it would stop the war, then we would do it immediately,\" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.. Germany relied on Russian gas for 55% of its imports last year, while for the EU as a whole it was 40%.. Experts widely agree that sanctions agreed by the West until now are unprecedented but Eddie Fishman rates them at \"seven or an eight of 10 in intensity\". He was a lead official in the US State Department in 2014 when sanctions were drawn up in response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.. \"Oil remains the life-blood of Russia's economy,\" he argues. \"Putin has made billions of dollars since the war began and Russia's oil sales remain very strong.\" . The EU's latest proposals tighten sanctions on four Russian banks. Although major Russian banks have been shut out of the Swift financial messaging system, two of the biggest are not. . Again, it's energy-related. Sberbank and Gazprombank facilitate energy payments from Europe to Russia.. Lithuania announced that from the start of this month it had put a stop to all Russian gas imports. . \"Look friends, you can do the same,\" President Gitanis Nauseda told his EU counterparts. It had become possible through investment in liquified natural gas and electricity link infrastructure, he explained.. But could the EU, as a whole, really turn off the taps to Russian energy?. There have been warnings of factory closures, jobs losses and plummeting public consent for sanctions. . You would have to pray for warm and windy weather, says Jacob Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund. Warm to lessen the need for heating homes - and windy to power Europe's electricity generating turbines.. And while Mr Kirkegaard agrees with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that a ban could trigger a recession, he believes the blow to Russia would be worse. . \"The Russian government would, in my opinion, be compelled to start printing large amounts of new roubles with the risk of inciting significant additional inflation in Russia.\" . Beyond energy, sanctions so far have hit Russia's tech, aviation and finance sectors, as well as its oligarchs - the wealthy Russians who made their fortunes under President Putin's patronage. . But, as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reminded Belgian lawmakers in an address last week, there are other awkward areas where business goes on. . Rough diamonds are still moving from Russia to Antwerp and sea ports remain open to Russian shipping.. So while trade ties between the EU and Russia have been seriously frayed, strained but lucrative connections remain.. An energy embargo remains the \"ultimate\" economic severance weapon, and Germany is usually cited as the main obstacle to that. But other countries are accused of hiding behind Chancellor Olaf Scholz's frank assessments.. \"Germany is really afraid of what might happen to its economy,\" says Prof Karen Pittel, a director at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich.. \"But in principle, if it happens tomorrow, then we'll survive it.\" . She also believes that the outlook has shifted after President Putin began demanding payment for gas in roubles. Germany refused but Prof Pittel says it's possible there may come a time when Germany has no other choice than to abandon Russian energy.. It still seems extremely unlikely that Europe will be cut off from Russian supplies in one, big dramatic move, but pressure is mounting.. \"Clear and determined sanctions are necessary. These sanctions are not working,\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this week.. Until recently, the idea of an energy embargo would not have just seemed unlikely. It would have been unthinkable.  . The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell. Inside their crazy, fabulous and fast-paced life in their beloved Bolton home.

He is thought to have founded Wagner and given it its name - his own former call-sign.. He is a veteran of the Chechen wars, a former special forces officer and a lieutenant colonel with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service.. The Wagner Group first went into action during Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, says Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King's College London.. \"Its mercenaries are thought to be some of the 'little green men' who occupied the region,\" she says. \"About 1,000 of its mercenaries then supported the pro-Russian militias fighting for control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. . \"Running a mercenary army is against the Russian constitution,\" she adds. \"However, Wagner provides the government with a force which is deniable. Wagner can get involved abroad and the Kremlin can say: 'It has nothing to do with us'.\" . Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, says Wagner mainly recruits army veterans who need to pay off debts: \"They come from rural areas where there are few other opportunities for them to make money.\". Some suggest Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, secretly funds and oversees the Wagner Group. . Mercenary sources have told the BBC that its training base in Mol'kino in southern Russia is next to a Russian army base. . Russia has consistently denied Wagner has any connection with the state.. The BBC investigation that identified Utkin's links to the Wagner Group also links Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch known as \"Putin's chef\" - so-called because he rose from being a restaurateur and caterer for the Kremlin.. Many of Mr Prigozhin's companies are currently under US sanctions for what it calls his .   He has always denied any connection with the Wagner Group..

Most recently, the Wagner Group has been . , in West Africa, to provide security against Islamic militant groups.
