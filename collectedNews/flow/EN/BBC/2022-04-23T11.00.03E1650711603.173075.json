        "content": "It follows four attacks across Afghanistan on Thursday - all claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). . The Taliban say they have defeated IS but the group remains a key security challenge to Afghanistan's new rulers.. No-one has admitted carrying out Friday's attack in Kunduz, which came as worshippers gathered to pray. . A local shopkeeper told AFP news agency: \"The sight at the mosque was horrifying.\". The explosion was similar to Thursday's bomb which tore through a Shia Muslim mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 31 people  and wounding 87. . Thursday's attack in Kunduz killed four people and wounded 18. . Admitting those attacks, IS said it was part of an ongoing global campaign to \"avenge\" the deaths of its former leader and spokesman.. Bomb attacks in Afghanistan have declined considerably since the Taliban came to power last August following the withdrawal of US and other Western forces after 20 years in the country.. IS does not control any territory in Afghanistan, but since their rivals, the Taliban, took power, they have been carrying out attacks in areas where they previously never had a presence, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Pakistan.. Sufism, a mystical order of Islam, has been practised in the region for centuries. Most of the radical Sunni militant groups despise the Sufis, as well as Shia Muslims, as heretics.. IS militants also target the Taliban, with whom they have a fierce rivalry.. Responding to the attacks, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described the perpetrators as \"evil elements\", adding \"serious efforts are being made to arrest and punish them\".. The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Afghanistan Ramiz Alakbarov said the attacks this week were \"a painful reminder of the insecurity and dangers facing the Afghan people daily\". . \"The indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices, which has already caused more than 100 civilian casualties this week, is unacceptable and must cease immediately,\" Mr Alakbarov said in a statement on Friday. .

According to the research - which was published this week in the .  - the rise in gun-related deaths among Americans between the ages of one and 19 was part of an overall 33.4% increase in firearm homicides nationwide. . Homicides, the study noted, disproportionately impact young Americans. . Over the same time period, the rate of firearm suicides in the US rose by 1.1%. . The overall rate of gun deaths of all reasons - suicide, homicide, unintentional and undetermined - among children and teenagers rose by 29.5%, more than twice that of the wider population. . \"We continue to fail to protect our youth from a preventable cause of death,\" said a research letter published in the journal on Wednesday. . The rate of gun-related deaths per 100,000 residents rose among both men and women and across ethnic demographics between 2019 and 2020, with the largest increase among black Americans.  . In past years, gun-related deaths were second only to car crashes as the leading cause of death among young Americans. Car deaths, however, have fallen over time and in 2020 approximately 3,900 Americans under 19 died in vehicle crashes. . Incidents of drug overdoses and poisonings rose 83.6% between 2019 and 2020, and now are the third leading cause of death in that age group. A separate .  published earlier in April found that 954 young people died of overdoses in 2020, compared to 492 in 2019. . Gun violence in the US has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020. . \"The reasons for the increase are unclear,\" the research letter said. \"It cannot be assumed that firearm-related mortality will later revert to pre-pandemic levels\". . A separate study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in February, found that 7.5 million US adults - just under 3% of the population - became first-time gun owners during the pandemic between January and April 2021. .

        "content": "Mr Ghosn said he was \"expecting\" the move though he was \"surprised at the timing\".. Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019.. The former head of Nissan, once one of the most powerful figures in the car industry, is currently unable to leave Lebanon, as he is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice issued by Japan.. He told the BBC: \"I want to stand trial because that's the only way I can get rid of the Red Notice which today forbids me from leaving Lebanon.\". He said he wanted a trial in Lebanon on the charges brought against him in Japan, and any that emerge from the French investigation -  and was \"totally confident\" he could prove his innocence.. Prosecutors in France are investigating claims that Mr Ghosn funnelled millions of euros from Renault through Suhail Bahwan Automobiles.. According to reports first published in .  he used the money for personal purchases including that of a 120-foot yacht.. An investigating magistrate in France has now issued five international arrest warrants against Mr Ghosn and four people linked to a car distributor in Oman.. Mr Ghosn told the BBC on Friday: \"There was not one euro [from Nissan or Renault] that ended up benefitting me directly or indirectly\".. He denied he was a fugitive from justice - and repeated previous claims he had left Japan because he would not have had a fair trial there. . Mr Ghosn said the charges against him were part of a conspiracy to derail his plans for a full merger between Renault and Nissan.. Since his escape, Carlos Ghosn has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him in Japan were baseless. . They were, he maintains, part of a conspiracy, designed to prevent him from orchestrating a merger between Nissan and its French partner Renault.. But for several years a separate investigation has been quietly taking place in France. An investigating magistrate recently questioned Mr Ghosn at length in Beirut.. The decision to issue an international arrest warrant suggests the French side believes there is a genuine case to answer at least.. Mr Ghosn has said he would be happy to stand trial in France to clear his name, and his lawyers seem confident that would happen. But there's a problem.. The former executive is banned from leaving Lebanon because he is still subject to an extradition request from Japan, even though that request is highly unlikely to be granted.. For the moment, he remains in a legal limbo.. Mr Ghosn once ran the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, one of the biggest car-making groups in the world.. He was arrested in Japan in late 2018, and faced a number of charges, including claims he deliberately mis-reported his earnings and used company money to fund his own lifestyle. He denied any wrongdoing.. He has previously spoken of his dramatic escape from Japan, which involved disguising himself to go unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon as he awaited trial. . Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, Lebanese and French passports, cannot be extradited to France from Beirut, although he confirmed to the BBC that he has been questioned as part of the investigation.. He said he thought France had issued the arrest warrant because under its law the investigation could not be closed unless he was in French territory.. \"So in a certain way we were expecting something like this to happen,\" he said. \"What was surprising was the timing...and also that we knew about it through an American newspaper...without me being officially alerted.\". Earlier, his lawyer, Jean Tamalet at King & Spalding, told the BBC: \"We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law.\". Warrants were also issued against the current owners and former directors of the car distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. .

Both people were released \"pending further investigation\". The department did not identify either of the individuals involved.. The attack occurred on board a JetBlue fight on Wednesday night, before it set off from San Francisco to Florida.. The video - published by TMZ - does not show the entirety of the altercation and a water bottle is not visible in the footage. . According to TMZ, Tyson had agreed to take a picture with the passenger at the beginning of the flight. But the man continued to harass Tyson, despite requests from Tyson to \"chill\".. The video of Tyson striking his fellow passenger includes audio of another person calling \"hey Mike, Mike\", seemingly trying to calm him while another person tries to push Tyson away. . It then shows the passenger's forehead, which appears bloodied. . The San Francisco Police Department said it was \"aware of video that possibly captured the incident\".  The footage was sent to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office which has jurisdiction over the investigation. . Tyson is no stranger to violence inside and outside the ring.. In 1992, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison. In 1997, he was disqualified from a fight after biting off part of his opponent's ear. . And in 1998, Tyson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour assault following a car accident in Maryland..

It is unclear if Gen Minnekayev's comments were officially sanctioned by the Kremlin, but they were widely cited in Russian state media including the Interfax and Tass news agencies.. Russian defence officials told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that they were \"looking into\" the general's comments, which - if confirmed - offer the first insight into Russia's potential plans in the coming weeks. . Meanwhile, a senior EU official told Reuters that Russia is likely to intensify its attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast in the coming days, adding that the next two weeks may be decisive in the war. .

Gen Minnekayev, who is deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was speaking at a military event in the Sverdlovsk region on Friday. . \"Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,\" Gen Minnekayev said. .

        "content": "He said Marine Le Pen's far right was fuelled by unhappiness and risked a society of hate and fracture.. It was proof of his weakness, she said, that he used old insults of extremism.. The opinion polls give the sitting president the edge in the second round run-off, but Ms Le Pen's far right party has never been this close to power which is why the stakes are so high.. The number one issue in this election has been the spiralling cost of living, from energy bills and food shopping to the price of filling up a car. It was identified very early on by the Le Pen team, who have promised a government of national unity to attack the high cost of living, as well as a referendum on immigration and a ban on wearing headscarves in public. . Her simple message to voters has been: \"It's Macron or France\".. Mr Macron also kept his message brief: \"This election is a form of referendum, on secularism and on Europe.\" He argues Ms Le Pen's idea of a \"Europe of nations\" would mean an end to the EU.. He invoked the UK's vote to leave the EU and the presidency of Donald Trump in a TV appeal to voters. \"There are millions of people who, a few hours before Brexit, decided what was the point in going to vote. Millions did the same in 2016 with Trump. The next day they woke up with a hangover,\" he said.. Accusing him of insulting both her and those who voted for her, Ms Le Pen said France had endured five years of chaos and could rediscover civil peace and respect. \"We won't find it with the same man and the same type of rule,\" she said.. The biggest issue for both candidates is the large number of voters who are set to cast blank ballots or not even vote at all. The polls suggest turnout could be the lowest since 1969.. \"I'm going to vote blank because it's my national duty to cast my vote, but I still want to show my unhappiness with the system,\" Edrisi, a voter in a southern suburb of Paris, told me.. The dissatisfaction with Mr Macron's brand of centrism and with mainstream politics was laid bare in the first round, when well over half the electorate backed the far right or far left. . More than one in five voters backed far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who came third, narrowly behind Marine Le Pen.. Many in France have not forgotten the .  or yellow-vest protests over fuel costs and rising prices that erupted 18 months after Mr Macron came to power. Ms Le Pen has exploited claims that he is a president for the rich.. The final polls suggest the sitting president will win between 53% and 57% of the vote, so there are big question marks over who those 7.7 million Mélenchon voters will back. According to an Ipsos poll on Friday, 48% of people who voted for him in the first round support neither candidate in the final round. . While one in three of those far-left voters will back Mr Macron, there are a sizeable number who dislike him so much they would rather vote for the far right.. Campaigning ended at midnight French time (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and the two teams are now required by law to halt electioneering until voting ends on Sunday evening.. As the sun went down in Paris, one of the rising stars of Mr Macron's party joined party activists in handing out leaflets in a last-ditch appeal for votes.. Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie said the government was acutely aware that a disaffected public needed to be brought closer to mainstream politics: \"Maybe it will be one of the major issues of a new Macron period, if he's re-elected. Everyone in politics has to consider the way we make and enact policy. And if people don't feel their lives are getting better, then they won't see the use of politics and they won't vote.\". This video can not be played. It has been an unusual election from the start, overshadowed first by the Covid pandemic and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which meant Mr Macron only engaged with voters eight days before the first round.. Even though 12 candidates took part in that initial race, only three performed well. The two mainstream parties that traditionally ran France until the meteoric rise of Emmanuel Macron in 2017 attracted little over two million votes between them.. The campaign did eventually burst into life on Wednesday night, when the two final candidates sparred for almost three hours on live TV, with the moderators barely getting involved.. And it continued right until the final moments of Friday, with the head of Ms Le Pen's National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, promising to save public money and return it to the French people..
