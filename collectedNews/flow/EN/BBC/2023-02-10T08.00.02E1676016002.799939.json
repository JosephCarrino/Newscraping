        "content": "Freezing conditions threaten the lives of thousands of survivors who are now without shelter, water and food. . Turkey's president called the quake \"the disaster of the century\".. A major international relief effort is gathering pace. On Thursday the World Bank pledged $1.78bn in aid to Turkey including immediate finance for rebuilding basic infrastructure and to support those affected by the earthquakes. . But the efforts of 100,000 or more rescue personnel on the ground are being hampered by a number of logistical hurdles including vehicle shortages and devastated roads.. UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the full extent of the catastrophe was still \"unfolding before our eyes\", especially in Syria where a long-running civil war has devastated the country.. On Thursday, the first UN humanitarian aid crossed the border into north-western Syria through Idlib's Bab al-Hawa crossing. The crossing is the only way UN aid can reach the region without travelling through areas controlled by Syrian government forces.. Mr Guterres promised more help was on its way and he urged the UN Security Council to allow supplies to be delivered through more than one border crossing. . \"This is the moment of unity, it's not a moment to politicise or to divide but it is obvious that we need massive support,\" he said.. Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, told Reuters that they were in desperate need of heating and more supplies, saying: \"last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad.\". The White Helmets rescue group said the only UN convoy that reached the region did not contain specialised equipment to free people trapped beneath the rubble.. \"This makes us very disappointed at a time when we are desperate for such equipment to help us save lives from under the rubble,\" the group said on Twitter.. Officials said on Thursday that 17,600 people had died in Turkey and the death toll was at least 3,377 in Syria. The toll surpasses the more than 17,000 killed when a similar quake hit northwest Turkey in 1999.. Tens of thousands of people across Turkey and Syria are spending a fourth night taking refuge from bitter temperatures in makeshift shelters having been made homeless by the quakes. . Resat Gozlu, a survivor in south-eastern Turkey who is now living on the floor of a sports complex with his family, said rescue workers did not arrive until three days after the quake.. He said many remain trapped under the rubble and others died of hypothermia.. \"If this continues there could be serious health issues and illness,\" he told the BBC. . Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned a second humanitarian disaster will strike unless survivors can get access to shelter, food, water and medicine \"very fast\". . The WHO's Regional Director for Europe,  Dr Hans Kluge, told the BBC the organisation's staff in Turkey's Gaziantep have to sleep in cars because \"there's still hundreds and hundreds of aftershocks\".. Dr Kluge said communities in Syria depend on water reservoirs, which were the first to fall. He said the reservoirs need to be replaced or the country faces cholera outbreaks - which he said was an issue before the earthquake.. ",

        "content": "US military official: 'We think before we shoot'. It was equipped with multiple antennas capable of \"intelligence collection operations\", a senior State Department official said in a background briefing.. On Thursday, US lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution condemning China for the balloon. . China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes. . It has said the balloon was a weather device blown astray.. The US, however, believes the balloon is part of a wider fleet of surveillance balloons that has spanned five continents.. House of Representatives lawmakers called the balloon a \"brazen violation of United States sovereignty\" as the body voted 419 to 0 on Thursday morning to condemn its use.. Its appearance in US airspace has provoked a diplomatic crisis and led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. The US military used a fighter jet to shoot the balloon down over the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend.. China on Thursday said it was not aware of any wider fleet of surveillance balloons. The claim is \"probably part of the information and public opinion warfare the US has waged on China\", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.. China also took aim at US President Joe Biden after he said during a PBS interview that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was facing \"enormous problems\". Those remarks were  \"highly irresponsible and violate basic diplomatic protocols\", Ms Ning said. . The senior State Department official said on Thursday that high resolution images revealed the balloon - which was about 200 ft (60 metres) tall  - had large solar panels capable of operating \"multiple active intelligence collection sensors\" as well as antennas that were able to collect and geo-locate communications.. The US is considering taking action against groups linked to the Chinese government that were involved in the balloon's flight, the official said.. The latest US government information suggests that the craft indeed was some type of surveillance balloon, experts told the BBC. . \"The types of antennas are meant for surveillance technology and this is not something you would expect for any type of scientific mission,\" said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Civil and Systems Engineering.. It's still not possible to glean exactly what type of data China might have been trying to gather on the balloon mission, experts said, but it may have intercepted radio, cell phone and other communications from the military bases it flew over, said Matt Kroenig, the senior director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council. . The balloon's large solar panels - as well as the fact that it was able to hover over US airspace for long periods of time - is concerning, Dr Falco said. . \"They have a high-powered system that can do a lot of data relay,\" said Dr Falco. \"I don't know exactly what they were collecting, but all the mechanics are there for getting a lot of data back to their satellites.\". The US may have taken countermeasures to prevent China from gathering data, including jamming equipment, Dr Kroenig said. . The FBI said that its lab is helping process debris that has been collected, which has so far included parts of the balloon canopy, wires and electronic components collected from the surface of the sea.. Most of the balloon's \"payload\" - which would likely include surveillance gear and other items of interest to investigators - remains underwater off the South Carolina coast. Officials warn that processing the wreckage could take a long time, which could be prolonged by poor weather conditions. . This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. US intelligence, military and foreign policy officials began briefing members of Congress on Thursday about the balloon.. The hearings come amid mounting criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the incident from his political opponents. . On Wednesday, an open letter from Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Roger Wicker said they lack \"a clear understanding\" of the government's response to the balloon.. Speaking to senators, US Army Lieutenant General Douglas Sims said that \"the risk of Chinese intelligence collection was low to moderate\" as the balloon flew over the US.. The potential of harming civilians on the ground if it was shot down over land, conversely, was \"moderate to significant\". . Officials also defended the timing of the balloon's destruction, saying that doing so over rough terrain in Alaska or the cold waters of the Northern Pacific would have made recovery efforts difficult and dangerous. . At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South East Asia, East Asia and Europe..

Aya is now in hospital. . \"She arrived on Monday in such a bad state, she had bumps, bruises, she was cold and barely breathing,\" said Hani Marouf, the paediatrician looking after her.. She is now in stable condition. . Videos of Aya's rescue went viral on social media. Footage showed a man sprinting from the collapsed debris of a building, holding a baby covered in dust. . Khalil al-Suwadi, a distant relative, who was there when she was pulled to safety, brought the newborn to Dr Marouf in the Syrian city of Afrin. . Thousands of people on social media have now asked for details to adopt her. . \"I would like to adopt her and give her a decent life,\" said one person.. A Kuwaiti TV anchor said, \"I'm ready to take care of and adopt this child... if legal procedures allow me to.\". The hospital manager, Khalid Attiah, says he has received dozens of calls from people all over the world wanting to adopt baby Aya. . Dr Attiah, who has a daughter just four months older than her, said, \"I won't allow anyone to adopt her now. Until her distant family return, I'm treating her like one of my own.\". For now, his wife is breastfeeding her alongside their own daughter. . In Aya's home town of Jindayris, people have been searching through collapsed buildings for loved ones. . A journalist there, Mohammed al-Adnan told the BBC, \"The situation is a disaster. There are so many people under the rubble. There are still people we haven't got out yet.\" . He estimated that 90% of the town had been destroyed and most of the help so far had come from local people.. Rescuers from the White Helmets organisation, who are all too familiar with pulling people out of the rubble for over a decade during Syria's civil war, have been helping in Jindayris. . \"The rescuers can end up being victims too because of how unstable the building is,\" said Mohammed al-Kamel. . \"We just pulled three bodies out of this rubble and we think there is a family in there that is still alive - we will keep on working,\" he said. . In Syria, more than 3,000 deaths have been reported following the earthquake. . This figure doesn't include those who have died in opposition-held areas of the country. . ",
