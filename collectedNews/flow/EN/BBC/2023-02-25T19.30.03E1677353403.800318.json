        "content": "Turnout appeared to be high, with many young, first-time voters arriving before dawn to cast their ballots.. The elections are the biggest democratic exercise in Africa, with 87 million people eligible to vote.. Politics has been dominated by two parties - the ruling APC and the PDP - since the restoration of multi-party democracy 24 years ago.. But this time, there is also a strong challenge from a third-party candidate in the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari - the Labour Party's Peter Obi, who is backed by many young people.. Tens of thousands of polling stations are counting the results, which will be collated and sent to the electoral headquarters in the capital Abuja.. The final result is not expected until at least Tuesday.. At a press briefing, the electoral chief, Mahmood Yakubu, apologised for the delays in voting, but he said that everyone who was in a queue by 13:30 GMT (14:30 local time) would be allowed to cast their ballots, even though polling stations were officially supposed to close by then.. Voters in the biggest city, Lagos, cheered as electoral officers arrived at a polling station in the suburb of Lekki nearly four hours after polls had officially closed.. There have also been reports of violence and ballot boxes being snatched in Lagos.. Although some voters were angry at the delays, others waited patiently to vote. . \"As a Nigerian you expect any eventuality, so I came out with my power bank and a bottle of water. I will wait till they arrive so I can vote,\" first-time voter Edith told the BBC.. Mr Yakubu said that armed men had attacked some polling units in the southern state of Delta and the northern state of Katsina, where voter card verification machines were carted away.. They were subsequently replaced and security boosted to allow voting to take place, he added.. But voting was postponed to Sunday at 141 polling stations in the oil-rich southern state of Bayelsa because of disruptions.. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials.. The lead-up to the polls was overshadowed by a cash shortage caused by a botched attempt to redesign the currency, leading to widespread chaos at banks and cash machines as desperate people sought access to their money.. The new notes were introduced in order to tackle inflation, and also vote-buying. On the eve of the election a member of the House of Representatives was arrested with almost $500,000 (£419,000) in cash, and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say.. Whoever wins will have to deal with the currency redesign, a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year.. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives, with another vote for state governors in March.. The election has seen a huge interest from young people - a third of eligible voters are below 35.. Mr Obi, 61, is hoping to break up Nigeria's two-party system after joining the Labour Party last May.. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria's youth, especially in the south.. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted as he is unlikely to win.. Instead, the PDP, which ruled until 2015, wants Nigerians to vote for Mr Abubakar, 76 - the only major candidate from the country's mainly Muslim north.. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies.. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman.. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity.. Its candidate, Mr Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, during his two terms as governor until 2007.. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies.. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states to be declared the winner.. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria's history.. ",

Watch: Suspected gang members taken to mega-prison. President Bukele tweeted that the first 2,000 people were transferred \"at dawn, in a single operation\" to the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, which he says is the largest jail in the Americas.. \"This will be their new house, where they will live for decades, all mixed, unable to do any further harm to the population.\". The mega-prison - in Tecoluca, 74 kilometers (46 miles) southeast of the capital San Salvador - comprises eight buildings. Each has 32 cells of about 100 square meters (1,075 square feet) to hold \"more than 100\" prisoners, the government says. . The cells only have two sinks and two toilets each.. President Bukele declared a \"war on gangs\" last March, passing emergency measures which have been extended several times.. The emergency powers have been controversial as they limit some constitutional rights, such as allowing the security forces to arrest suspects without a warrant.. More than 64,000 suspects have been arrested in the anti-crime drive. . Authorities have said criminal gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio-18 number tens of thousands and are responsible for homicides, extortion and drug-trafficking. The aim of the mass arrests is to make the gangs \"disappear altogether\", the government says.. Human rights organisations have argued that innocent people have been caught up in the policy, and some of those held have reported being subjected to \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\".. But Bukele's anti-gang push remains popular with Salvadorans.. ",

Tens of millions of residents in the Golden State are under blizzard, wind and flood warnings.. The storms have blacked out nearly a million properties from coast to coast.. The West Coast's main motorway, Interstate 5, was partially closed south of the Oregon border. .

The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that \"significant mountain snows are likely Friday night into early Saturday, with major impacts to travel and infrastructure. . \"Downed trees and power lines are possible. Lower elevations may experience significant snowfall over areas where snow is unusual.\".

        "content": " in Moscow.. Beijing has released not one but two position papers - the first offering the Chinese solution to the war, and the other outlining a plan for world peace. These largely retread China's talking points from the past year, calling for respect for sovereignty (for Ukraine) and the protection of national security interests (for Russia), while opposing the use of unilateral sanctions (by the US). . The West may come away unimpressed - but convincing them was never likely the main goal for Beijing.. Firstly, it clearly seeks to position itself as a global peacemaker. An obvious clue about who it's really trying to charm lies in one of its papers, where it mentions engaging South East Asia, Africa and South America - the so-called Global South. . In preaching an alternative vision to a US-led world order, it is wooing the rest of the globe, which is watching to see how the West handles the Ukraine crisis.. But another goal is to send a clear message to the US. . \"There is an element of defiance,\" said Alexander Korolev, an expert in Sino-Russian ties at the University of New South Wales. \"It is signalling: 'If things get ugly between us, I have someone to go to. Russia is not alone, which means that I will not be alone when there is a confrontation… don't get comfortable in bullying me.'\". The timing, say observers, is a giveaway. Relations between the US and China have hit a new low, . . Some have also questioned why China - if its intention is to help end the war - is only just now making its big diplomatic push for Ukraine peace.. \"China had ample opportunities to display leadership, it was invited early on to contribute to ending the war… If the goal was to truly display the image of a global leader, you don't have to sit on the fence for one year and try to perform a diplomatic dance,\" said Dr Korolev.. There was a third goal, and it could be seen in Mr Wang's itinerary. . By visiting France, Germany, Italy and Hungary, whose leaders China perceives as taking less of a hardline stance on Russia, Mr Wang may have been testing the waters to see if China could lure some of Europe into China's orbit.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. Beijing sees a \"logical convergence of interests\" with these countries, said Zhang Xin, an international political economy expert with the East China Normal University in Shanghai. \"It believes the US has hegemonic power, and that a large part of the Transatlantic world could benefit from detaching from that system.\". But whether China will succeed in that particular goal is questionable. Mr Wang's speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he criticised the US, did not play well in a roomful of America's staunchest allies and, according to diplomats, only spawned greater distrust of China's true motives.. His tour \"was a very overt push to say: 'We don't have problems with Europe, we have problems with the US, we can fix things with you Europeans and you need to understand that the US is leading you down a problematic road'\", said Andrew Small, a senior fellow specialising in Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank.. \"But I think in most places in Europe, this message doesn't have much traction.\". The key question now is whether Beijing will live up to its word of making peace as it tightens its embrace of Russia. . The US has warned this week that . , and that Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.. Publicly China has reacted with angry rhetoric. But behind closed doors, .  that it will not provide weapons to Russia.. According to Mr Borrell, Mr Wang had also asked: \"Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms to Russia when you are providing arms to Ukraine?\" . It is a revealing line, say observers, showing that Beijing still truly believes the West is to blame for fuelling the war. . \"Sending weapons to any warring party is considered as further escalation - that is the position of the Chinese state so far,\" said Dr Zhang.. There is scepticism that Beijing would supply weapons to Moscow, given how it runs counter to Chinese interests.. Such a move would be seen by others as a clear escalation of the war, and would lead to sanctions and disruption of trade with the West - hugely damaging for China, as the EU and US are among its top trading partners. . It would also raise global tensions significantly and likely push US allies further into Washington's embrace, stymieing Beijing's plan to woo some of them away. . What is more likely to happen, say observers, is that Beijing will continue or even step up indirect support to Russia, such as boosting economic trade - which has provided a financial lifeline to Moscow - and abstaining from sanctions on Russia.. They may even supply more dual-use technology through third party states such as Iran or North Korea, according to Dr Small, so that they can lend support \"as deniably as possible\".. But as the war drags on, the issue of giving lethal weapons will resurface, he warned. . \"There hasn't been a question yet on what kind of significant things China could be asked to do, because previously Russia didn't need to resupply,\" said Dr Small. \"But they are hitting that juncture. How long is China willing to say to Russia it will not do it?\". Days before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared they had a \"friendship without limits\". . A year on, China will have to answer the question of how far it would go for its special friend.. ",

        "content": "\"I really want to believe that China will not supply weapons to Russia,\" he said.. China's plan calls for peace talks and respect for national sovereignty.. However, the 12-point document does not specifically say that Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine, and it also condemns the usage of \"unilateral sanctions\", in what is seen as a veiled criticism of Ukraine's allies in the West. . The Chinese authorities have so far not publicly responded to Mr Zelensky's call for a summit with Mr Xi.. Meanwhile, Russia hailed the Chinese peace proposals. \"We share Beijing's views,\" the foreign ministry in Moscow said in a statement.. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said .  - a claim strongly denied by Beijing. On Friday, American media again reported that the Chinese government was considering sending drones and artillery shells to Moscow.. Asked about the Chinese plan, US President Joe Biden told ABC News on Friday: \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's applauding it, so how could it be any good?. \"I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,\" he added.. China appears to be siding with Russia, though it would like to find a way of rescuing President Putin by arranging some kind of face-saving peace deal, says the BBC's World Affairs Editor John Simpson. . The Chinese proposals follow a visit by the country's top diplomat Wang Yi to Moscow, where he met President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday.. After the talks, Mr Wang was quoted by China's state-run Xinhua news agency as saying that Beijing was willing to \"deepen political trust\" and \"strengthen strategic coordination\" with Moscow.. Western officials gave the latest proposals a lukewarm reception. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Beijing \"doesn't have much credibility\" because it had \"not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine\".. President Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and Russian troops made significant advances during the first few days in Ukraine's north, east and south.. But the attack on the capital Kyiv was soon repulsed and the Ukrainian military was later able to retake large areas.. The conflict - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has since become a grinding war of attrition.. This video can not be played. Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds. At a lengthy news conference in Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky also said victory \"will inevitably await us\" if allies \"respect their promises and deadlines\".. Poland said it had already delivered four German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine and was ready to deliver more. Germany has said it will provide 14 Leopard tanks, with Spain and Canada also sending tanks. . The US - by far the biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine - has pledged to send 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks and the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks.. The Ukrainian leader added that his country had failed to engage sufficiently with countries in Africa and Latin America after .  during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution condemning Russia's invasion. . \"We didn't work well for many years, we didn't pay attention, I think it's a big mistake,\" he said.. Asked if he could name his worst moment of the war so far, Mr Zelensky said Bucha, a town outside Kyiv where Russian troops are accused of having killed civilians in the early part of the war. The small town had been under Russian control until Ukrainian troops fought back last April to reclaim it.. \"What I saw. It was horrible,\" Mr Zelensky said, visibly moved.. The US marked a year since Russia invaded Ukraine by announcing a new range of sanctions against Russia and new aid for Ukraine.. The latest restrictions target more than 100 entities both within Russia and worldwide, including banks and suppliers of defence equipment. The US said it wanted to stop those helping Russia exploit loopholes to get sanctioned materials.. The White House's fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $12bn (£10bn), comprising $2bn from the Department of Defense including ammunition and drones and $10bn from the State Department including budgetary support to the Ukrainian government. . A further $550m will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.. Moldova is Europe's poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.. It comes days after US President .  and held talks with Mr Zelensky.. On Friday, the EU also approved its 10th round of sanctions against Russia, imposing restrictions on technology that has a civilian and military dual use.. ",
