        "subtitle": "The PM defends the rise, but Labour's Sir Keir Starmer calls it \"the wrong tax at the wrong time\".",
        "content": "The prime minister said it was \"unquestionably the right thing for our country\" as the health service was the \"biggest priority\" for people.. But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"the wrong tax at the wrong time\". . The NI hike came into force on Wednesday, and is expected to raise £39bn over the next three years.. As well as funding NHS services, the money will also go towards social care. . Speaking to reporters during a hospital visit in Hertfordshire, Mr Johnson said there were now six million people on NHS waiting lists, adding: \"We have got to give our doctors and nurses the funding to deal with that. . \"We've got to do the difficult things, we've got to take the big decisions, the right decisions, for this country.\". But the Labour leader criticised not just the tax, but its timing. . Speaking in Lancashire, Sir Keir said: \"In the middle of the worst cost of living crisis for decades, today the government chooses to increase taxes on working people.\" . He agreed NHS backlogs needed to be addressed, but claimed the government would use the money raised to pay for its \"incompetence and failure\" over Covid fraud and unused equipment - not for health care.    . The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, joined the criticism, saying increasing NI was an unfair way of raising the cash needed for health and social care.. He told BBC Breakfast: \"It puts all the burden on working people - that is wrong.\". The SNP said the rise was a \"catastrophic error of judgement\" by the government that would \"plunge millions of families into poverty\", while Plaid Cymru described it as a \"dubious measure\" that helped create a tax system \"both less equitable and less efficient\".. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC it would be \"morally wrong\" to expect future generations to pay for the funding that was needed now.. \"The choice for us as a country is we either put that money in ourselves now, and if we don't do it ourselves, we will have to borrow it,\" he said. . \"And that is mortgaging the future of our children and our grandchildren.\". He added: \"Why should our children pay for our healthcare and our adult social care? They are going to have enough challenges as they grow older.\". This video can not be played. The plan to raise National Insurance was first announced in September.. The tax hike will see employees, employers and the self-employed all pay 1.25p more in the pound on NI for a year.. Then the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy from April 2023.. The government said the changes would raise £12bn a year, which would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS after Covid.. A proportion of the levy will then be moved to fund social care over the next three years.. But the move has come in for criticism from opposition parties, some Tory MPs and campaigners, as well as businesses, especially the timing of the increase. . The National Insurance rise will, ministers like to say, provide a much needed boost to health and social care.. They claim it will pay for .  and boost NHS capacity to help tackle the backlog in England - it is up to the rest of the UK to decide how they spend the proceeds.. But the truth is it will only contribute to that. . Rising inflation, staff shortages, and ageing equipment and buildings, mean the health and care system is going to suck up the £39bn raised over the next three years by the hike and then some more.. It is also worth bearing in mind the government had already committed to rises for the NHS up until 2024 under a funding settlement agreed by Theresa May's government.. This had brought the increases to something close to the 4% health had historically got, although the rising inflation that is being seen will whittle that away from now on.. And that came after a decade of the budget rising by little more than 1% - an unprecedented squeeze for the health service.. The National Insurance rise is not quite all it seems..

        "subtitle": "A government strategy is expected to contain plans to expand nuclear and offshore wind power.",
        "content": "Boris Johnson has been holding talks with figures from the nuclear, renewables, and North Sea oil and gas sectors ahead of the launch.. Ministers are also under pressure over soaring energy bills facing consumers, amid rising gas prices.. So what can we expect the strategy to say?. Senior government sources have told the BBC the prime minister wants to make \"two big bets\" on nuclear and offshore wind in the strategy. . He has previously indicated he'd like to see 25% of the UK's energy generated by nuclear by 2050, though the Treasury has raised concerns about the costs of targets like this falling outside of the government's current spending review period. . At the moment, the UK has six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand, with 15% generated in 2020. Most of their reactors are due to cease operating and be shut down before 2030.. Funding the construction of new plants has proved challenging in recent years, and complications over costs were a factor behind the . . . Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed ministers will set up a new body to oversee the delivery of new nuclear plants.. The government also recently .  to finance nuclear projects by allowing developers to add costs to customers' bills during construction.. Ministers argue this will prove less expensive for energy users than current funding models, where these costs can only be added after a station starts generating electricity. . The government also plans to .  in a £20bn project to build a new plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk. . Wylfa, a decommissioned nuclear power plant on the island of Anglesey in north Wales, is among half a dozen sites already being considered for new stations.. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart is set to visit the United States this week for talks with US firms Bechtel and Westinghouse about reviving plans for a new site, following the withdrawal of Japanese company Hitachi two years ago.. Mr Johnson has also expressed his desire for a \"colossal\" offshore wind farm to industry leaders. . A senior source told the BBC he is looking for a \"Kate-Bingham like\" figure to lead the expansion of offshore wind - in a reference to the venture capitalist who led a government taskforce on buying Covid vaccines.. The PM is said to have told industry leaders that if the UK \"could create a vaccine in a year\" then he wished to do the same with a large offshore wind farm. . There have also been discussions about boosting onshore wind farms, which have faced greater hurdles for approval since planning laws in England were tightened in 2015.. A senior government source has also told the BBC Mr Johnson was \"horrified\" when he was told that onshore wind turbines could take a \"day\" to put up, but \"10 years\" to approve in England. . Some Tory activists have opposed their impact on the landscape, despite polls suggesting high public support for them, and cabinet ministers are split over whether planning laws in England should be relaxed. . The business secretary favours a relaxation, but has said any expansion of onshore wind would need community consent and benefits. . Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he did not favour \"a vast increase\" in onshore wind farms, calling them an \"eyesore for communities\".. But it's possible the strategy may commit to just reviewing the planning laws - even if no decisions have yet been made.. The BBC has been told incentives - such as cheaper energy bills - are being considered for people who live near new onshore wind farms, and these could be introduced whether planning laws in England are relaxed or not.. That could mean those benefits are felt more acutely in Scotland and Wales, where planning rules are already less stringent.. The strategy is also likely to touch on increasing domestic production of gas and oil in the North Sea.. However, ministers say they don't want to burn more gas, but instead produce more of it domestically while they transition to renewables. . Ministers have also commissioned a new study into the impact of fracking - extracting shale gas from the ground.. The .  has been banned in the UK since 2019, amid fierce local opposition and fears of earth tremors - but some Tory MPs have been pushing for it to be lifted.. Announcing the review on Tuesday, the business secretary says the war in Ukraine meant it was right to look at \"all possible domestic energy sources\".. He pledged the ban on fracking would remain in place in England unless scientific evidence showed it is safe and causes \"minimal disturbance\" to nearby residents.. Solar power is also expected to be part of the strategy - with incentives also being considered for people who live near new large solar farms constructed in England.. Supporters say a new generation of farms say they could provide a source of renewable energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes. . But plans for new farms have faced local resistance, with a number of Conservative MPs also voicing their opposition.. The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell.

        "content": "He said budgets are being stretched by a National Insurance (NI) rise taking effect on Wednesday.. He accused the Tories of breaking promises by raising taxes.. The rising cost of living - driven by global economic turmoil and the war in Ukraine - has been a key issue ahead of the elections, which will test support for political parties across the UK.. The polls will take place on 5 May, when votes will be held to elect local councils in England, Wales and Scotland, and the government in Northern Ireland.. The Lib Dems will compete with Labour in some places in these elections, but the party's priority will be targeting long-standing Tory voters.. To woo these voters, the Lib Dems say they will put the cost of living at the centre of their election campaign in England.. One measure they are proposing is a cut to value added tax (VAT) from 20% to 17.5% for one year, a move they predict would save households an average of around £600.. The party says its plans would give a boost to struggling high street businesses by encouraging spending, and help keep costs under control by reducing prices in the shops.. \"There's a cost of living emergency and that's why Liberal Democrats are calling for this emergency tax cut,\" Mr Davey told the BBC. \"It is a large one, but it's right for the times.\" . The Lib Dem local elections offer includes proposing a 16% sewage tax on water companies' annual profits.. The government has faced a public backlash over the amount of sewage discharge into rivers and the sea. . after 1,000 a day were recorded in 2021.. Kicking off the campaign by the River Wandle in south-west London, Mr Davey accused Tory MPs of failing to act on the issue of sewage discharge.. The Lib Dems also want to establish a national community ambulance fund to allow trusts to reopen ambulance stations and cancel planned closures.. Lib Dem analysis of Office for Budget Responsibility figures shows that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will receive a VAT windfall of £38.6bn over the next four years.. That calculation takes into account rising costs, which the party says will see a typical family will pay an estimated £430 more in VAT next year.. This video can not be played. The party says the rising VAT bill \"comes on top of the Conservative government's manifesto-breaking increases\" to tax, with the income tax threshold frozen and NI rising by an extra 1.25p in the pound..  is forecast to raise £39bn over three years and is being used to fund the NHS and social care.. Together, the tax rises will leave a typical family £535 a year worse off, even before the extra VAT pinch is felt, according to the Lib Dems.. Mr Davey said the government's approach to tax policy was not fair \"because it puts the burden on working people, particularly low-paid people\".. \"Now, more than ever, they deserve a fair deal, but the rising cost of energy, soaring energy bills, are overwhelming millions of families and pensioners,\" he said at the launch.. Rising prices raise money with one hand, but take it away with the other.. The government will be getting more money in than they expected a year ago. Prices are rising faster than was expected back then. And when prices go up, you pay more VAT. . But rising prices also put a squeeze on the government's budgets: for example, energy for hospitals or schools will cost more and benefits will eventually rise in line with this year's price hikes.. So rising prices are less of a windfall than they might appear at first glance. . The rise and fall of media mogul Robert Maxwell.

        "content": "Fracking was halted in the UK in 2019 amid opposition from green groups and local concerns over earth tremors.. But senior Conservatives have been calling for a rethink in recent weeks.. They claimed fracking would give the country a \"competitive and reliable source of energy\" amid concerns over security of access and rising energy prices. . But other MPs and campaigners have warned against a change in direction, with Labour's Ed Miliband saying the new report had \"nothing to do with the energy needs [and] everything to do with the Conservatives bowing to their backbenchers\". . Fracking firms claimed the report was a \"tentative first step\" to overturning the ban and \"exploiting [the] potential\" of shale gas.  . At the time of the moratorium, ministers said they would not change their minds without \"compelling new evidence\".. The move comes ahead of the publication of the government's energy supply strategy, expected this week. . Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised the plan in \"days\" on 9 March to help tackle energy prices and reduce reliance on Russia.. But the date kept being pushed back, with sources telling the BBC that the Treasury was unhappy with the cost of commitments to nuclear power. . The strategy itself is thought to include strategies for nuclear energy and renewable energy, plans to make homes more energy efficient and a route to increasing North Sea oil and gas production.. Some Conservatives from the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) have also been pushing for a rethink of the government's legally-binding target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.. But Mr Johnson and his business secretary have both ruled that out. . Speaking on Tuesday to the Harvard Kennedy School, Mr Kwarteng said the net-zero target was \"set in stone\", adding: \"The government's view is we don't need to change the targets… but we can be more flexible by looking at things like energy efficiency [and a] greater diversity of energy sources.\". Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng insisted the government \"must be led by the science\" in its approach to fracking. and it would remain banned, unless it was shown to be \"safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby\". . \"It remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.. \"However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power. . \"In light of Putin's criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources.\". In his letter to the BGS, Mr Kwarteng asked for more information on any new techniques which could make the fracking process safer and how any risks compare to those associated with other forms of underground energy production. . But shadow climate change secretary, Mr Miliband, condemned the move, saying: \"The government itself concluded that fracking is unsafe, and will not help our energy security or cut bills, and fracking is strongly opposed by local communities.. \"It is a sign once again that this government cannot be trusted to deliver on the green energy sprint we need for energy security, to cut bills and tackle the climate crisis.\". SNP MP Deidre Brock also called for the review \"completely unacceptable\", adding: \"When the leaders of the world descended on Glasgow for COP26, we pledged to do everything we can to end our reliance on fossil fuels, and everything in our power to tackle the climate emergency.  . \"By reintroducing fracking, we would be going back on our word, which could have devastating consequences.\". Friends of the Earth added that it was \"pure fantasy\" that fracking was the answer to the UK's energy needs. . Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth, then directing a high pressure mixture of chemicals into layers of rock to release shale gas.. The UK has only ever had one fracking site in operation - run by Cuadrilla - which halted in 2019 following a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA).. The indefinite suspension came after the OGA found it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice.. But last week, regulators lifted an order for the two controversial wells to be capped with concrete.. The chief executive officer of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, welcome the government review, claiming they recognised \"the huge potential that shale gas offers this country\".. He added: \"We trust that this review will allow Britain's huge shale gas resources to be exploited.  . \"This can create tens of thousands of jobs, bolster energy security, and provide cheaper gas for local communities, and millions of pounds in tax revenues for northern councils.\".

        "content": "The event will not go ahead after LGBT+ charities and other groups pulled out over the government's stance on conversion therapy.. Therapy aimed at transgender people was excluded from a ban outlined last week.. The BBC understands there were several hours of crunch talks in an attempt to salvage the event, but ultimately organisers were unable to move forward after the majority of organisations involved pulled out.. A number of LGBT+ organisations and charities had .  which said they would not lend their support for the event unless Boris Johnson included transgender people in the ban.. Earlier on Tuesday .  over the exclusion of transgender people from any conversion therapy ban that would instead only apply to sexual orientation.. The unpaid role was created especially in the lead-up to the conference, and was expected to last at least 18 months. . In a letter to the prime minister, Iain Anderson said he had \"no choice\" but to quit and did so with a \"heavy heart\".. At the conference, Mr Anderson would have been expected to showcase what UK businesses have done in reducing workplace discrimination and promoting equality for LGBT people.. He wrote: \"Trust and belief in the government's overall commitment to LGBT+ rights has been damaged. . \"I believe a comprehensive plan to support LGBT+ people to play their full part in our society is urgently needed.\". In a statement, a government spokesperson thanked him for his contribution and said they were considering the issue of transgender conversion therapy further in what they described as a \"legally complex\" area.. According to NHS England, that therapy tries to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.. Some groups have expressed concern it could impede those helping people with gender dysphoria by blocking explorative therapies or those that do not automatically affirm someone's gender identity.. The government had promised to outlaw the practice of conversion therapy for all, .  any ban would only apply to attempts to alter a person's sexuality, not attempts to try to change people's gender identity.. A spokesperson said the government would carry out \"separate work\" on the issue of transgender conversion therapy but it was keen for any legislation not to have \"unintended consequences\".. The U-turn led to more than 100 organisations withdrawing from the Safe To Be Me Conference, which was due to be held in London over three days this summer.. Boris Johnson has previously called the practice of conversion therapy \"repulsive and abhorrent\" and had promised plans to outlaw it on a number of separate occasions.. A number of gender critical groups had fought for the ban not to include conversion therapy relating to issues of gender identity.. Responding to the legislation on Friday, Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at No 10, said elements of the law would have had \"profound consequences for children struggling with gender dysphoria\".. She told BBC Radio 4's Today: \"Doctors, therapists and parents would be deterred from exploring with a child any feelings of what else may be going on, for fear of being told they're trying to change a child's identity\", adding it was \"deeply concerning\".. The Welsh government is now looking at legal advice to see what action it can take to ban trans conversion therapy.. One Conservative MP, Dehenna Davison, expressed her disappointment the conference had been cancelled, tweeting: \"We had such a huge opportunity to prove the UK (and the Conservative Party) is a defender of freedom. As a Conservative member of the LGBT+ community, it is so wrong it has come to this.\".
