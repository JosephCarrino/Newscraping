        "content": "Schools have been shut and traffic has been suspended in 10 regions.. Earlier, Freddy caused some damage in Mauritius, flooding beachside hotels.. The head of Madagascar's National Office of Risk and Disaster Management told the BBC that \"negligence\" was to blame for the deaths.. \"Despite the awareness that we spread. People still dare to ignore the instructions and the warnings,\" said Elack Olivier Andrikaja, adding that three of the deaths happened when a home collapsed.. The Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable to cyclones. It is hit by an average of 1.5 cyclones every year, the highest rate in Africa, according to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.. The cyclone slightly weakened once it made landfall on Madagascar, with wind gusts exceeding 130km/h (81mph). The country's meteorological service warned that torrential rains would continue along its path. . \"The sea remains very rough... and a significant risk of coastal flooding will continue overnight,\" it said. . A 27-year-old man drowned near the port of Mahanoro before the storm made landfall, officials said. . Officials also said 7,000 people had been pre-emptively evacuated from the coastal region directly in Freddy's path, and warnings waves could reach over 8m (26ft) were issued by the International Federation of Red Cross. . Some people used sandbags to weigh down their roofs as a precaution, but that didn't stop the storm from ripping roofs off houses.. \"All the doors and windows started shaking,\" said Tahina, a resident of Mananjary, a coastal town of around 25,000 people 30km from where the cyclone first made landfall.. She had fled her home with her parents and three children to shelter in her husband's office.. \"Next to us, at least five houses have lost their roofs,\" Tahina told AFP news agency.. Pascal Salle sobbed as he surveyed the damage caused by Freddy - which had ripped a window off of his home and turned his garden into a \"sandy field\".. \"It's a repeat performance. I can't take this every year, it's not possible. Batsirai and Emnati in 2022, Freddy in 2023... Who's to say that in 15 days another one won't fall on us?\" he said.. Last month the powerful storm Cheneso smashed into north-eastern Madagascar bringing in heavy winds and triggering downpours that caused extensive flooding, and killing at least 33 people and forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.. Mananjary is still recovering from devastation caused by last year's Cyclone Batsirai, which killed more than 130 people across Madagascar.. Cyclone Freddy is forecast to cross the ocean from Madagascar and make landfall in Mozambique, before potentially moving further inland to hit Zimbabwe, UN officials say. . The body estimates that more than two million people could be affected.. ",

        "content": "Wagnerites have been deeply involved in the siege of Bakhmut in east Ukraine.. The defence ministry denied his claims.. \"All statements allegedly made by assault units on shell shortages are absolutely untrue,\" it said, without naming either Prigozhin or the Wagner group.. Describing the arming of mercenary groups as a priority, the ministry listed 1,660 rockets, 10,171 artillery rounds and mortars and 980 tank rounds that had been supplied between Saturday 18 February and the following Monday.. Prigozhin, who founded Wagner, for years had close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin but the war in Ukraine has prompted an increasingly bitter rivalry between the mercenaries and the regular army, and analysts believe he no longer has the president's ear.. Mercenary groups like Wagner are supposedly illegal in Russia but Prigozhin has not only registered it as a company but was filmed last year openly recruiting for the war from Russia's prisons.. Last month Wagner claimed victory in the eastern town of Soledar, only for the defence ministry to say later that it was in control of the town. . The fight for Bakhmut has gone on for more than six months and has become the main focus of the Russian offensive in the east. The campaign is believed to have cost thousands of lives.. Never one to hold back, Prigozhin complained that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov not only prevented ammunition from being sent but did not help with air transport or even providing shovels for digging trenches. . Such direct opposition within the military to equipping his fighters amounted to treason, he said.. When the ministry denied his allegations, he hit back describing its statement as \"spitting\" at Wagner, complaining it had not received 80% of the ammunition requested to carry out its combat missions.. He then posted a picture, apparently from the Bakhmut area, of the corpses of dozens of mercenaries killed in battle lying on the frozen ground awaiting collection.. \"These are the guys who died yesterday because of so-called 'shell shortages'. There are five times more of them than there should have been,\" he said in an audio message to his press service.. He called on Russians to demand publicly, but without resorting to demonstrations, that the defence ministry give ammunition to his troops.. The raw power struggle at the heart of Russia's war in Ukraine has prompted commentators to speculate whether Prigozhin is being squeezed out by Gen Gerasimov, who was recently put in charge of the campaign.. Pro-Kremlin pundit Sergei Markov said Russians who backed the war were clearly backing Prigozhin and the squabble would undermine the defence ministry's authority.. Russia expert Mark Galeotti said that if ammunition was being withheld then, along with the rotation of Wagner troops away from Bakhmut, \".  (however meaningless) for some time\".. \"We will not leave Bakhmut,\" vowed Prigozhin in his audio message. \"We'll simply die in double the numbers until all [the Wagnerites] are finished. And when the Wagnerites are completely finished, most likely Shoigu and Gerasimov will have to pick up machine guns.\". ",

The men were shot and killed after they opened fire at the troops, it added.. The troops also shot back after coming under fire from other armed men and having explosives, petrol bombs and stones thrown at them during the clashes, according to the military.. The Palestinian health ministry said 72-year-old Adnan Saabe Baara was among those killed during the raid. . Video footage showed a body in a street next to bags of bread, in what is usually a busy market area of the old city. . A 61-year-old man called Abdul Hadi Abdul Aziz Ashqar and a 16-year-old boy Mohammad Farid Shaaban also died, according to the health ministry.. More than 100 other Palestinians were also wounded by gunfire. Seven of them are in a critical condition in local hospitals.. The Israeli military named the three militants who were the targets of the raid as Mohammed Abdul Fattah, 23, a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Walid Dkhail, 23, and Hussam Isleem, 24, of the Lion's Den group. . The military said they were suspected of carrying out previous shooting attacks, including one last October that killed an Israeli soldier, and of planning others in the near future.. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he condemned the raid and held Israel's government responsible for \"this dangerous escalation, which is pushing the region toward tension and an explosion\".. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, warned that it was \"monitoring the escalating crimes conducted by the enemy against our people in the occupied West Bank and is running out of patience\".. Nablus and nearby Jenin have been the focus of search, arrest and intelligence gathering raids that Israel has intensified over the last year amid a spate of deadly Palestinian attacks.. This latest one comes despite reports this week of an understanding brokered by the US aimed at calming tensions.. So far this year, at least 50 Palestinians - including militants and civilians - have been killed, while 11 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis.. ",
