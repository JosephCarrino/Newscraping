        "content": "Watch: Rescuers search wreckage of deadly Greece train crash. Rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Protests were also held in Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa, near where the disaster happened on Tuesday night.. The government has said an independent investigation will deliver justice.. Three days of national mourning have been declared across the country following the incident, in which a passenger service crashed head on into a freight train, causing the front carriages to burst into flames. . The front carriages of the passenger train were mostly destroyed.. Many of the 350 passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said \"tragic human error\" was to blame for the disaster.. A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence. He has denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on a technical fault.. Rail union members believe safety systems were not working properly, with repeated warnings about this over many years.. In protest and mourning, rail workers are planning on striking on Thursday at what they say is official neglect of the railways.. \"Pain has turned into anger for the dozens of dead and wounded colleagues and fellow citizens,\" the workers' union said in a statement announcing the strike.. \"The disrespect shown over the years by governments to the Greek railways led to the tragic result,\" it added in comments cited by Reuters news agency.. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the disaster, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"long-standing failures\" to fix a railway system he said was not fit for the 21st Century.. But outside a hospital where bodies of the train crash's victims were being brought, a banner was hung claiming that any systemic failings would be covered up in the official investigation now under way.. At a silent vigil in Larissa on Wednesday to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had only been a matter of time.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he added.. \"This is an inadmissible accident. We've known this situation for 30 years,\" a doctor based in Larissa, Costas Bargiotas, told AFP.. A vigil was also held in Athens, outside the offices of Hellenic Train. Later in the day, things turned violent in the same area, with police using tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones and lit fires in the streets.. At the site of the country's worst ever train crash, rescuers yet again worked through the night. . Families have been arriving at a nearby hospital to give DNA samples so that their missing loved ones may be identified.. But this will become an increasingly difficult process as more remains are retrieved of those who were at the front of the passenger train and who bore the full force of the head-on collision and the fire that then ripped through their carriages.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage had reached 1,300C (2,370F), which made it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\"..

        "content": "He fled the airport after his name was called over the loud speaker, agents say, and was arrested at home later that evening. . Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials say they spotted the device during a routine screening. . Officials say Mr Muffley checked in for Allegiant Air Flight 201 at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 65 miles (105km) north of Philadelphia, on Monday morning. . About an hour later, TSA screeners discovered the suspicious item and called FBI specialists, including a bomb technician, to examine the device. . In charging documents, FBI bomb technician Jared Witmier said a 3 inch (7.5cm) device hidden in the lining of the suspect's rolling suitcase was found to contain fuses and explosive powder. . There was a quick fuse, which appeared to be a part of the original manufacture of the compound, and a hobby fuse, which seemed to have been added post-manufacture, according to the criminal complaint.. The \"powder is suspected to be a mixture of flash powder and the dark granulars that are used in commercial grade fireworks\", the FBI court document says. . \"The black powder and flash powder are susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and posed a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.\". The bag also contained \"a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with white powder residue, a wireless drill with cordless batteries\" and two circuit breakers that were taped together. . Five minutes after he was paged over the airport loud speaker, Mr Muffley was seen by security cameras leaving the airport, the court papers say. He was traced to his home in Lansford, Pennsylvania, later on Monday. . He is charged with possession of an explosive in an airport and possessing or attempting to place an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft. . He is due in court on Thursday. . ",

        "content": "It is a growing issue for people in the area, her lawyer told BBC News. . The fungus, which consumes ethanol fumes, grows on surfaces near bakeries and distilleries around the world. . Mrs Long, who runs an events venue next to several Jack Daniels warehouses, including one under construction, says the invading fungus has required her to spend thousands on power washing.. She is suing the local county zoning office, arguing it did not properly approve permits for the warehouses.. Some infuriated locals are now calling for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which is owned by Louisville-based company Brown-Forman, to install air filters to combat the problem.. Jason Holleman, a lawyer representing Mrs Long, says whiskey companies often speak about the evaporation process - dubbed \"the angels' share\" - without mentioning the resulting mould that comes with it. . \"If you go on one of these distillery tours they will tell you about the angels' share that goes into the atmosphere,\" he says. . \"And unfortunately that also results in the devil's fungus.\". In a court order, Lincoln County Chancellor J.B. Cox instructed Lincoln County zoning officials to order construction to be halted after he ruled that the permitting process was never fully completed.. Mr Holleman said he anticipates asking the court to order Brown-Forman to stop using six recently-built warehouses, which are commonly known as barrelhouses, that are also near Mrs Long's property. . Brown-Forman spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway .  newspaper: \"We respect the chancellor's ruling and look forward to working with Lincoln County on updated permits. . \"The Jack Daniel Distillery will continue to comply with regulations and industry standards regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses in Lincoln Co.\". Brown-Forman did not respond to a BBC News request for further comment. . Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey was founded in Moore County, which neighbours Lincoln County, in 1866. . The fungus - named Baudoinia compniacensis - is named after the director of the French Distillers' Association that discovered it growing near cognac distilleries in the 1870s. . It has led to complaints and lawsuits .  to Canada and the Caribbean.  . Federal agents in Tennessee used to look for the fungus as a sign that illegal alcohol - moonshine - was being made nearby, Mr Holleman says. . The whiskey industry in Tennessee is growing, along with residential development, leading to more conflicts between distillers and homeowners. . According . , residents in at least three other counties have fought distillery expansions, arguing that the fungus would harm property values. . ",

        "content": "The coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the ex-workers and compensate others who were affected.. In response, Starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies.. \"We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review,\" Starbucks told the BBC.. In a more than 200 page decision, Michael A Rosas, who is a federal administrative law judge, also ordered Starbucks to rehire another worker that he ruled had been illegally forced out of their job.. Mr Rosas said Starbucks had showed \"a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights\" in response to union campaigns.. The judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay.. It also repeatedly sent high-ranking staff to stores \"in order to more closely supervise, monitor, or create the impression that employees' union activities are under surveillance,\" he said.. The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to safeguard employees' rights to unionise at their workplaces.. Michael Sanabria, a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, said the ruling was \"such a massive win for us, and for the labour movement as a whole.\". \"The decision results from months of tireless organising by workers... demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,\" said Michelle Eisen, a barista at another Starbucks location in Buffalo.. Last year, workers at around 270 of Starbucks stores across the US voted to join unions, despite opposition from the firm. Starbucks has around 9,000 company-owned stores in the US.. Union campaigners have accused the company of dragging its feet at the bargaining table and violating labour laws as it tries to shut down the movement.. Starbucks - which has long prided itself on its reputation as a progressive, worker-friendly employer - has said it respects workers' right to protest.. In recent months the company has raised pay and made other changes in response to the discontent.. This video can not be played. Watch: How UK strike rules could be about to change. ",

        "content": "The meeting is seen as a diplomatic test for India as it seeks to balance its position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its global ambitions.. Delhi has increasingly faced pressure to take a firm stand against Moscow.. But India has resisted the pressure and continued with its strategy of not criticising Russia directly. The country has regularly abstained from voting on UN resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine, . .. Also last week, G20 finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on a closing statement at their meeting in Bangalore (Bengaluru) city, in the first ministerial meeting in the run up to the summit later this year. . Both Moscow and Beijing declined to accept parts of a closing statement that deplored Russia's aggression \"in the strongest terms\". In the end, India had to release a chair's summary which noted \"different assessments of the situation\" in Ukraine within the group. . \"This war has to be condemned,\" Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told reporters after the meeting, according to news agency Reuters. . \"I hope, I am sure that India's diplomatic capacity will be used in order to make Russia understand that this war has to finish,\" he said.. Analysts say tensions over Ukraine are expected to overshadow talks on Thursday as well. . The meeting is being attended by 40 delegations, including those led by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang.. On Wednesday, India's top diplomat Vinay Kwatra said that while the war in Ukraine would be an important point of discussion, \"questions relating to food, energy and fertiliser security, the impact that the conflict has on these economic challenges that we face\" would also receive \"due focus\".. India has been positioning itself as a leading voice of developing countries - known as the Global South - in recent years, and experts say it wants to use its G20 presidency to focus on issues it sees as more urgent for the developing world..
