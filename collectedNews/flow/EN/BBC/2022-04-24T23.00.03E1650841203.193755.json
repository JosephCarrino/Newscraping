        "content": "Many victims were burnt beyond recognition.. The police are now looking for the owner of the illegal refinery. . The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money.. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice.. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. . The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109.. \"We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\" he earlier told the AFP news agency.. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency.. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. . The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. . But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country. . What did Putin do before he came to power?. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story. Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle. ",

The Kazu 1 is believed to have been on a three-hour sightseeing voyage around the Shiretoko Peninsula.. The area is a designated UNESCO world heritage site, and boat trips are popular with tourists hoping to spot whales and sea lions as well as brown bears on the rocky beaches.. The crew managed to signal that the vessel was tipping at a 30-degree angle and starting to sink, according to Japanese media.. Patrol boats and police and military aircraft were immediately dispatched to find the vessel. Local fishing boats were also taking part in the search operation.. Of the 26 on board, two were crew and two were children.. Earlier reports suggested that several people were pulled out of the waters - but it is unclear if they are among the confirmed 10 victims.. Waves in the area had been high and local fishing boats had apparently decided to return to port by mid-morning. . The crew reportedly said that all those on board were wearing life jackets. . But temperatures in the area can dip as low as 0C (32F) when night falls. . What did Putin do before he came to power?. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story.

        "content": "One resident told the BBC a green fence appeared inside his locked-up compound three days ago without any explanation.. For weeks Shanghai's 25 million-strong population has been shut in their homes while officials try to contain the city's worst Covid surge to date.. Images of workers in white hazmat suits sealing entrances to the city's housing blocks and closing off streets with green fencing have spread in recent days on Chinese social media.. Many of the fences, which are around two-metres tall, were installed around buildings designated as \"sealed areas\" where at least one person has tested positive for Covid-19.. Everyone living inside a \"sealed area\" is forbidden from setting foot outside their homes whether or not they have the virus.. It was not immediately clear why officials have began constructing the fences.. A notice dated 23 April from one local authority being shared online said it was imposing \"hard quarantine\" in some areas.. The BBC has not been able to verify these images but has spoken to a foreign national living in Shanghai who said green fencing appeared in his own residential complex three days ago.. The resident, who asked not to be identified, said that the main gate to his compound was chained up three weeks ago after he believes one of his neighbours tested positive for the virus.. But on Thursday he said workers installed a new barrier without any warning. . \"There is a long corridor in our compound, and within the long corridor they put up another green fence three days ago,\" he described on the phone. \"No one told us the reason it was installed.\". \"No one can get out,\" he said. \"I feel helpless. You don't know when the lockdown is going to end.\". \"If your area gets fenced off, what if a fire breaks out? I don't think anyone in their right mind can seal people's homes,\" he said.. While some city officials have been installing fences, others have been busy trying to block a popular video . .. The six-minute montage features unverified audio clips of the local population criticising inadequate food supplies and complaining about medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading in the video.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai say they have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures in the city include placing electronic alarms on doors to prevent those with the virus from leaving and forcibly evacuating residents to allow their homes to be disinfected.. Shanghai officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. The city reported 39 Covid deaths on Sunday, a record for Shanghai, in addition to more than 21,000 new infections.. In contrast to many other countries, China is pursuing a zero-Covid strategy with the aim of eradicating the virus from the country completely. . While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain more transmissible recent variants of the virus.. This video can not be played. What did Putin do before he came to power?. This is the raw, honest Paul Gascoigne story. Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle. ",
