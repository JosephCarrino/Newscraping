        "content": "The US says the drone was on a routine mission in international airspace when two Russian jets tried to intercept it.. Russia said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and denied that the two aircraft made direct contact. . The Russian defence ministry also said the MQ-9 Reaper drone was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.. Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. . The incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday, according to the US military. . This video can not be played. Watch: Pentagon calls Russia's move 'unsafe, unprofessional'. \"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,\" the statement said. . Several times before the collision the Su-27 fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said. . The US summoned the Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, to protest against the move.. Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\".. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The key question is whether Tuesday's encounter was an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work, or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . So this could simply have been a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. This video can not be played. Watch: What is a MQ-9 Reaper drone?. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "They are being investigated on charges of rape, people trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Both have denied wrongdoing. . Mr Tate's spokeswoman said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that his legal team would appeal.. Lawyers for Mr Tate have long argued that keeping him in preventative custody is unnecessarily harsh, when other judicial options - such as house arrest - are available.. Judges have so far disagreed, based on the perceived risk of Mr Tate fleeing the country, influencing witnesses or evidence, or that his release would disturb public order.. The request for bail in place of custody was new, but the response from the court, the same.. In late February, the court ruled that Mr Tate should remain in custody until 29 March. . On Wednesday, Mr Tate's brother Tristan will also apply for bail in a separate hearing. . Last month, an appeals court overturned all but one of the justifications for keeping Tristan Tate in detention.. No charges have yet been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.. In 2016, Mr Tate, a former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. ",

        "content": "The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January.. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington.. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an \"epidemic\".. But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives.. Mr Biden's executive order  - which does not require the approval of Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks.. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: \"While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.\". The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over \"red flag\" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it \"would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives\", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will \"double down on the progress made\" in last year's bill..

There is a tense situation outside the compound, in the city of Lahore, as police try to force their way in. . He is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated. . Police have made previous attempts to arrest him, but Mr Khan, 70, told the BBC he thought they were determined to put him behind bars this time.. \"I'm mentally prepared that I'm going to be spending my night in a cell,\" he said. \"I don't know how many nights, but I'm all prepared for that.\". The former prime minister appeared in front of what he said were tear gas cannisters, which he said had been fired into his property. . He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders to arrest him in corruption cases. . Mr Khan's supporters are also holding protests in other cities..
