        "content": "He won by 58.55% to 41.45%, a greater margin than expected.. The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a \"president for all\".. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen said her vote share still marked a victory.. The ideas her National Rally represented, she told her supporters, had reached new heights. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had failed just like her father who preceded her: \"It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat.\". \"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,\" Mr Macron said in his victory speech on Sunday night. \"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me.\". Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. \"Together we will move France and Europe forward,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. . Ukraine's Volodymr Zelensky, who had called on French voters to back Mr Macron, congratulated his \"true friend\" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe.. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.. Turnout was just under 72%, the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969. Adding more than three million spoilt or blank votes, that accounted for more than one in three voters. Mr Macron said his government would have to \"answer their choice to refuse to choose\". . Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. A large proportion of young voters were said to have avoided the second round.. Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. . He said it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, adding that Mr Macron had been elected in a worse way than any other president. \"He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots.\". This video can not be played. For all Mr Mélenchon's accusations, the president's re-election was a historic achievement. He is the first sitting president to be re-elected in 20 years.. Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars, telling cheering supporters that \"no-one will be left by the wayside\". . The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich.. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message when France was going through a considerable crisis involving \"many divisions and a lack of understanding\".. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight.. Mr Mélenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. And in her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the \"match is not completely over\" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high..

The Kazu 1 is believed to have been on a three-hour sightseeing voyage around the Shiretoko Peninsula.. The area is a designated UNESCO world heritage site, and boat trips are popular with tourists hoping to spot whales and sea lions as well as brown bears on the rocky beaches.. The crew managed to signal that the vessel was tipping at a 30-degree angle and starting to sink, according to Japanese media.. Patrol boats and police and military aircraft were immediately dispatched to find the vessel. Local fishing boats were also taking part in the search operation.. Of the 26 on board, two were crew and two were children.. Earlier reports suggested that several people were pulled out of the waters - but it is unclear if they are among the confirmed 10 victims.. Waves in the area had been high and local fishing boats had apparently decided to return to port by mid-morning. . The crew reportedly said that all those on board were wearing life jackets. . But temperatures in the area can dip as low as 0C (32F) when night falls. . Your first look at exciting new drama SAS Rogue Heroes. Preview incredible new drama Life After Life.

        "content": "And you don't need to look that hard to find dubious content. According to . , a website that monitors online misinformation, new users could be recommended false content about Ukraine within 40 minutes of joining the network.. While platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have been labelling false or misleading viral videos about the war, TikTok seems to be playing catch-up.. The company insists it has stepped up its efforts to combat misinformation.. Here are some of the most common categories of misleading content the BBC has identified on the platform.. From the early days of the war, fake livestreams have drawn some of the highest numbers of views on TikTok.. The recipe is simple: a user finds a dramatic video of an old conflict or some military drill, dubs fake audio of a huge explosion or an intense shootout, starts a livestream, and once a sizeable audience tunes in, asks for donations to their channel.. One such account had drawn nearly 30 million views by mid-March. All but three of the account's livestreams up to that point were short clips taken from a YouTube video of old Ukrainian military training, dating from 2017.. At one point, a fake audio track of gunshots became so popular that . .. Users can react to livestreams by sending the accounts points that can be converted into cash. . \"It seems like a lot of the looped scary livestreams were likely created with the hopes of earning money via TikTok's gifting system,\" says Abbie Richards, an independent researcher who creates videos with a focus on the dangers of misinformation.. Most of the fake livestreams can be easily found under popular hashtags such as #Ukraine or #UkraineWar.. \"The content is intended to blend in with all the other information available on the topic,\" says Ms Richards. . Dramatic footage of military video games or computer-generated imagery (CGI) has been regularly used as a substitute for real war videos.. Scenes from video games such as Arma 3 and Call of Duty have flooded TikTok. Fake aerial battles, including footage appearing to show fighter jets being shot down, have proved particularly popular.  . Some accounts try to make the action more realistic and use clips from war films, TV series or real-life games. . One video, which was viewed 24 million times, shows a man appearing to drop an explosive item on a tank. It was taken from a video of an Airsoft match - a team combat game similar to paintball - and uploaded to YouTube in January. . A separate fake livestream, viewed by 2.3 million users, is made up of CGI footage of missile strikes and has been circulating on the internet since last year. . Ms Richards says she has seen instances of users warning in the comments section of such videos that they are taken from video games or are made up. But the people behind the accounts can disable comments - and the warnings disappear.  . Videos of old conflicts are typically used when a new one is under way. The BBC has seen videos from wars in Libya, Syria and Chechnya being used as though they show the current conflict.. A video purporting to show intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces outside a block of flats has racked up 7.7 million views.. But the footage was in fact recorded in 2014 in the Chechen capital, Grozny, during a deadly attack by an armed jihadist group. Fake breaking news and live captions were overlaid on the original footage to hide the real source.. Some have posted videos from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, which could easily be mistaken for the current one, or footage of military exercises or parades in either country. . A video of a column of Ukrainian tanks in central Kyiv was presented as if they were on their way to defend the capital against a Russian offensive. It received nine million views. But it was filmed during an independence-day military parade several years ago.. And a video of a tank with a Ukrainian flag, speeding down a residential street - viewed four million times - also dated back to the Russia-Ukraine conflict of 2014.. Ms Richards says TikTok could address the problem of viral old videos by taking simple measures, such as making the date a video was posted clearer. . Like Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, TikTok collaborates with independent fact-checkers, albeit on a smaller scale. But while Facebook and Instagram have been labelling false and misleading content about Ukraine on their platforms, such labels are rare on TikTok.. Unlike some of its rivals, .  to academics, researchers and journalists, which Ms Richards says misinformation experts like her have been \"desperately\" demanding for some time.. What that means for independent fact-checkers is a time-consuming process of manually researching a huge volume of content on a regular basis.. Another issue, according to Ms Richards, is the absence of a community of TikTok users willing to debunk falsehoods on the platform.. \"When TikTok fails to ensure the accuracy of information receiving millions of views on its platform, that burden is falling on outside researchers and everyday TikTok users.\". A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: \"We continue to respond to the devastating war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation. . \"To support our efforts to help keep TikTok a safe and authentic place, we've added more resources to our moderation and fact-checking for content in Russian and Ukrainian, including local language experts and partnerships with independent fact-checking organisations.\" .

        "content": "Many victims were burnt beyond recognition.. The police are now looking for the owner of the illegal refinery. . The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money.. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice.. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. . The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109.. \"We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\" he earlier told the AFP news agency.. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency.. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. . The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. . But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country. . Your first look at exciting new drama SAS Rogue Heroes.

        "content": "One resident told the BBC a green fence appeared inside his locked-up compound three days ago without any explanation.. For weeks Shanghai's 25 million-strong population has been shut in their homes while officials try to contain the city's worst Covid surge to date.. Images of workers in white hazmat suits sealing entrances to the city's housing blocks and closing off streets with green fencing have spread in recent days on Chinese social media.. Many of the fences, which are around two-metres tall, were installed around buildings designated as \"sealed areas\" where at least one person has tested positive for Covid-19.. Everyone living inside a \"sealed area\" is forbidden from setting foot outside their homes whether or not they have the virus.. It was not immediately clear why officials have began constructing the fences.. A notice dated 23 April from one local authority being shared online said it was imposing \"hard quarantine\" in some areas.. The BBC has not been able to verify these images but has spoken to a foreign national living in Shanghai who said green fencing appeared in his own residential complex three days ago.. The resident, who asked not to be identified, said that the main gate to his compound was chained up three weeks ago after he believes one of his neighbours tested positive for the virus.. But on Thursday he said workers installed a new barrier without any warning. . \"There is a long corridor in our compound, and within the long corridor they put up another green fence three days ago,\" he described on the phone. \"No one told us the reason it was installed.\". \"No one can get out,\" he said. \"I feel helpless. You don't know when the lockdown is going to end.\". \"If your area gets fenced off, what if a fire breaks out? I don't think anyone in their right mind can seal people's homes,\" he said.. While some city officials have been installing fences, others have been busy trying to block a popular video . .. The six-minute montage features unverified audio clips of the local population criticising inadequate food supplies and complaining about medical conditions.. \"We haven't eaten for days now,\" one person can be heard pleading in the video.. Public criticism of government policies is rare in China, but in the past few weeks some Shanghai residents have posted complaints on social media sites.. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai say they have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.. Other recently introduced measures in the city include placing electronic alarms on doors to prevent those with the virus from leaving and forcibly evacuating residents to allow their homes to be disinfected.. Shanghai officials have also ordered all infected patients and their close contacts to be transferred to government-run centralised quarantine.. The city reported 39 Covid deaths on Sunday, a record for Shanghai, in addition to more than 21,000 new infections.. In contrast to many other countries, China is pursuing a zero-Covid strategy with the aim of eradicating the virus from the country completely. . While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain more transmissible recent variants of the virus..
