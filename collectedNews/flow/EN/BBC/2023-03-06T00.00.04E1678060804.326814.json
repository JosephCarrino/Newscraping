        "content": "Beijing's military budget - around $225bn (Â£186bn) - is still dwarfed by that of the United States, which is four times greater. . But analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence. . Outgoing Premier Li Keqiang told the NPC that \"external attempts to suppress and contain China are escalating\".. \"The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board,\" he said. . It was also announced at the meeting that China would pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year.. The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.. But this year's sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions.. This week's NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi's leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.. He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, . The increase in military spending comes as Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.. US officials have also repeatedly warned that China may invade Taiwan in the coming years. China has held ever-growing displays of military force in the air and seas around Taiwan, . China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. . The NPC will also unveil the new premier, China's equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.. Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi's most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. . ",

        "content": "The agreement was reached on Saturday evening, after 38 hours of talks, at UN headquarters in New York.. The negotiations had been held up for years over disagreements on funding and fishing rights.. The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 - the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.. That agreement established an area called the high seas - international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research - but only 1.2% of these waters are protected. . Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.. In the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, . These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. . Environmental groups .  that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.. The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".. Rena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.. Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.. Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. . Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. . Dr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.. He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that's our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\". Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\".. \"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.. Countries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. . Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\". ",
