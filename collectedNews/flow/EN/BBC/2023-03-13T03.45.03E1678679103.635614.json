        "content": "The taxpayer will not bear any losses from the move, the statement said.. SVB was .  who seized its assets on Friday.. It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. The move came as the firm, a key tech lender, was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. \"The US banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,\" the authorities' joint statement said.. \"Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe.\". Those actions also apply to Signature Bank of New York, seen as the most vulnerable institution after SVB, which came under regulatory control on Sunday.. As part of their moves to restore confidence, regulators also unveiled a new way to give banks access to emergency funds. . The Federal Reserve said it would offer assistance through a new Bank Term Funding Program, making it easier for banks to borrow from it in a crisis.. President Joe Biden said the American people could have \"confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them\".. SVB was seen as a crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector. It was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. I've been speaking to people with money stuck in SVB over the weekend. . One founder told me had been constantly refreshing his online banking page, hoping it might work. . Another said he was confident the government would step in, but admitted he might have lost about around 40% of the company's cash overnight. . This statement, then, has been welcomed by depositors. But there are those that will raise eyebrows at this move. . SVB mainly banked start-ups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley - the tech elite.  And those Silicon Valley elites tend to have more than a streak of libertarianism to their politics: the boilerplate view is that government is slow and too big. . Critics argue that it's with great irony that it's the government who has stepped in to save the day. Some will wonder whether influential tech bros have been given preferential treatment: capitalism for when things go well, socialism for when it doesn't. . It's why the statement is worded carefully that taxpayers will not be paying for this. Mr Biden will now have to defend the move - and reassure members of his own party that guaranteeing depositors was the only way. . SVB started as a California bank in 1983 and expanded rapidly over the last decade. . But it came under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks, which can happen in the blink of an eye in the digital age. But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. Meanwhile, . . A consortium of investors led by the Bank of London, a UK clearing bank, has submitted a formal bid to the UK Treasury. . The British government has been working on a plan to support UK tech firms affected by the collapse of SVB.. ",

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days, with many more seriously injured.. Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. . The BBC is unable to verify the numbers given by either side.. Analysts say Bakhmut has little strategic value, but has become a focal point for Russian commanders who have struggled to deliver any positive news to the Kremlin.. Capture of the city would bring Russia slightly closer to its goal of controlling the whole of Donetsk region, one of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Russia last September following referendums widely condemned outside Russia as a sham.. \"In less than a week, starting from 6 March, we managed to kill more than 1,100 enemy soldiers in the Bakhmut sector alone, Russia's irreversible loss, right there, near Bakhmut,\" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.. He added that 1,500 Russian soldiers were wounded badly enough to keep them out of further action.. Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces had killed \"more than 220 Ukrainian servicemen\". . The Wagner mercenary group is at the heart of the Russian assault on Bakhmut. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has staked his reputation, and that of his private army, on seizing Bakhmut. . He said on Sunday that the situation in the city was \"difficult, very difficult, the enemy is fighting for every metre\". . \"And the closer to the city centre, the fiercer the fighting,\" he said in a voice recording published on Telegram.. After his envisioned capture of Bakhmut, \"we will begin to reboot\" and \"will start recruiting new people from the regions\", he said.. But on Saturday, the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - reported that Moscow's offence was stalling.. \"Wagner Group fighters are likely becoming increasingly pinned in urban areas... and are therefore finding it difficult to make significant advances,\" . Before the invasion, there were about 70,000 people living in Bakhmut. The city was best known for its salt and gypsum mines and huge winery.. Like Russia, Ukraine has also given Bakhmut political significance, with President Zelensky making the city an emblem of resistance.. When he visited Washington in December, he called it \"the fortress of our morale\" and gave a Bakhmut flag to the US Congress.. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured so far in and around Bakhmut.. ",

He told the audience: \"Dreams are something you have to believe in - I almost gave up on mine.\". The 51-year-old took an extended break from acting after rising to fame as a child star in films such as The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.. In an emotional speech, the Vietnamese actor said: \"They say stories like this only happen in the movies - I cannot believe it is happening to me. This is the American dream.. \"My journey started on a boat, I spent a year in a refugee camp, and somehow I ended up here, on Hollywood's biggest stage... Thank you so much for welcoming me back.\".

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a madcap sci-fi adventure which sees a laundrette owner, played by Michelle Yeoh, hop through the multiverse exploring different versions of herself. . Quan plays the husband of Yeoh's character, while Curtis plays IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre who chases the family to pay their taxes.. The 95th Academy Awards are currently taking place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, with US comic Jimmy Kimmel hosting this year's ceremony.. A string of Hollywood A-listers are in attendance, .  outside the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.. The Whale - which launched Brendan Fraser's comeback - took best make-up and hairstyling, while Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio was named best animated feature.. Taking to the stage, the Mexican filmmaker said: \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre and animation is ready to be taken to the next step.\". All Quiet on the Western Front scored best international feature and best cinematography, while .  was named best live action short film.. Wakanda Forever's Ruth Carter repeated the best costume design victory she scored with the original film. She dedicated the prize to her mother, who died aged 101 last week.. The award for best documentary feature film went to Navalny, about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the events related to his 2020 poisoning.. In his speech, director Daniel Roher dedicated the award to Navalny and political prisoners around the world, saying: \"Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to the world.\". Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, added: \"Alexei, I am dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free, stay strong my love.\". Later in the ceremony, Everywhere All at Once is the favourite to win best picture after success on this year's awards' circuit.. But it faces competition from All Quiet on the Western Front and The Banshees of Inisherin, among others.. Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser, Cate Blanchett and Yeoh are the frontrunners in the leading actor and actress categories.   . The 95th Academy Awards ceremony is being hosted by US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel, who opened with a monologue which reflected on the last 12 months in the film industry.. \"They say Hollywood is running out of ideas. I mean Steven Spielberg had to make a movie about Steven Spielberg,\" he joked, referring to the director's autobiographical best picture nominee The Fabelmans.. He also paid tribute to composer John Williams, the oldest nominee in Oscars history. \"John turned 91 last month, and he's still scoring, if you know what I mean,\" Kimmel quipped.. Reflecting on the mixed year Hollywood has had, Kimmel said: \"Batgirl became the first superhero to be defeated by the accounting department.\". The US comic also made reference to Avatar: The Way of Water, which he said was \"another opportunity for James Cameron to do what he loves doing more than anything else - drowning Kate Winslet\" (the actress also appeared in Cameron's Titanic).. This video can not be played. Stars shine on Oscars champagne carpet. \"It was a big year for diversity and inclusion,\" Kimmel continued, \"we have nominees from every corner of Dublin.\" The Banshees of Inisherin has four acting nominations, including Colin Farrell and Kerry Condon.. \"Five Irish actors are nominated tonight which means the odds of another fight on stage just went way up.\". Later in the ceremony, Kimmel brought Jenny, the donkey who appears in the film, on stage. Her co-star Colin Farrell put his hand on his heart from the audience, while the audience cheered.. Finally - Kimmel referenced the event that overshadowed last year's ceremony - . \"If anyone here commits an act of violence during the show, you will be awarded best actor, and permitted to give a 19-minute speech,\" Kimmel said, to much laughter.. This is the chat show host's third time hosting the Academy Awards. He most recently presided over the 2018 event.. Viewers in the US can watch the Oscars live on ABC. The network is also streaming the ceremony on its website and app.. In the UK, Sky will air the ceremony across four of its channels simultaneously - Sky Arts, Sky News, Sky Showcase and Sky Cinema Oscars.. Unusually, that means British viewers can watch the Oscars on Freeview and Freesat. It is also available on streaming service Now (formerly Now TV). . Traditionally, the four acting winners from the previous year's Oscars come back to present the prizes to their successors.. This year, three of 2022's winners are returning - Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur - but the fourth, Will Smith, is absent as .  for 10 years.. Other stars presenting categories this year include Harrison Ford, Nicole Kidman, Samuel L Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, John Travolta, Emily Blunt, Jennifer Connelly and Florence Pugh.. Interestingly, Halle Berry has also been invited to present. She remains the only woman of colour to win best leading actress at the Oscars, but we could see the second this year with Yeoh..

        "content": "He was arrested in 2014 while crossing the border from Jordan into Saudi Arabia, accused of smuggling amphetamines.   . He was later sentenced to death, after a trial criticised by Amnesty International as \"grossly unfair\".  . His sister, Zeinab Abul Al-Khair, said he had told her from jail that he had been strung up by his feet and beaten.  . \"He never imagined a forced confession would be allowed in his trial,\" she told me earlier this year.. His case has drawn international concern, with fears for his fate growing after Saudi Arabia last November ended an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty for drugs offences. Within a fortnight, 17 men were executed on such charges.. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had found that Mr Abu al-Khair's detention lacked legal basis.   . And in late 2022, the UN Human Rights office appealed for his release.  . It says the use of the death penalty for drug offences is incompatible with international norms and standards.. \"We urge the Saudi government to halt al-Kheir's reported imminent execution and to comply with the Working Group's opinion by quashing his death sentence, releasing him immediately and unconditionally, and by ensuring that he receives medical care, compensation and other reparations,\" said spokesperson Liz Throssell.. The announcement that Hussein Abu al-Khair had been put to death was made on the Saudi press agency and comes a year to the day since the biggest mass execution in modern Saudi history.. Campaign group Reprieve said the Saudi authorities had not warned his family that he was about to be executed - or given them the chance to say goodbye. . It has been highly critical of Saudi Arabia's allies, including the UK, for not taking a stronger stand against human rights abuses in the Kingdom. . \"Exactly a year ago, Mohammed bin Salman's regime executed 81 men in a single day, and Saudi Arabia's international partners shrugged and issued empty statements about the importance of human rights,\" said Reprieve's director, Maya Foa.  . \"Rather than condemn the Crown Prince, world leaders queued up to shake his bloodstained hands. Today's atrocity and others like it is the inevitable result. When partners signal that the Saudi regime can kill without consequences, you can be sure it will,\" she added. . Mr Abu al-Khair's case was raised in the UK parliament in late November - with a Foreign Office minister answering an Urgent Question about a surge of executions in Saudi Arabia by saying that the authorities had \"clearly\" tortured him and describing his treatment as \"abhorrent\".. The following week the minister, David Rutley, asked for his words to be struck from the parliamentary record, . Responding to news of the execution, Conservative MP David Davis said: \"The UK government knew Hussein Abu al-Khair was at imminent risk, but the foreign secretary failed to publicly call for his execution to be halted, despite his predecessors taking this kind of action in the past. . \"The UK must signal it will no longer turn a blind eye to executions like these, and speak out strongly on behalf of others who remain at risk, including child defendants like Abdullah al-Howaiti.\". The Saudi Press Agency said the Ministry of the Interior was announcing that the death penalty had been implemented against Hussein Abu al-Khair to \"confirm the keenness of the Kingdom's government to combat drugs of all kinds because of the severe harm they cause to the individual and society\"..

        "content": "\"I think you are a Russian journalist. You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,\" said one social media user who claimed to be from the port city.. Russian forces put the people of Mariupol through a horrific months-long siege, before eventually capturing it last May.. I eventually found three residents willing to speak to me at length: a local city councillor, a retired pensioner and an engineer. All spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from the local authorities installed by Russia (who block access to occupied Ukraine by Western journalists).. They paint a picture of a massively expensive campaign conducted by Russia to win over the hearts and minds of the people of Mariupol, and rebuild a city damaged beyond recognition by Russia's own troops.. The purpose of this campaign is to assimilate Mariupol and make it Russia's own.. Their accounts corroborate each other, and are confirmed by social media posts about recent developments in Mariupol.. Before this war began about half a million people lived in the city.. According to UN estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed, and 350,000 people were forced to leave after Russia attacked in February 2022. . It is difficult to estimate the exact number of people killed as a result of the relentless shelling of Mariupol, but Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 died there. . Russian-installed authorities in Mariupol say some 300,000 people are now living there.. The people who spoke to me from Mariupol said their city had been inundated with labourers from across Russia, as well as from Central Asia. . Oleg Morgun, the Russia-installed \"mayor\" of Mariupol, says some 70,000 of those currently in the city are construction workers and members of the Russian military.. New buildings have appeared and many buildings damaged during the bombardment have gone.. For example, the Russian military has built a whole new district comprised of a dozen apartment blocks in the western part of Mariupol. It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.. \"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we're part of Russia now,\" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.. \"I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.\". In the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.. Heating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.. Many schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.. Maria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: \"It's so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares.\" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.. Russian has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.  . The fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.. The Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.. There are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.. For example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.. Ivan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed \"huge queues\" trying to get Russian passports.. They were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.. Also, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as \"filtration\", he added.. \"So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.. Mariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.. Russia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.. Russian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.. The media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.. Many current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.. \"We've suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,\" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.. The fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.. \"I'm sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,\" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). \"I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now.\" . City councillor Ivan said: \"It's become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It's tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.\". Those who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.. Popular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.. \"If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn't reconstruction. It's not something they can be thanked for,\" he said.. \"You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?\" he said. . \"You can't rebuild them. You can't bring them back.\". ",

The story raises fresh doubts about the UK's efforts to tackle illegal wealth. . British authorities have long been accused of not doing enough to prevent criminals from overseas using UK property to launder money.. The report says the ease with which Karimova obtained UK property was \"concerning\".. There is no suggestion that those acting for the companies linked to her were aware of any connection to her nor that the source of funds could have been suspicious. No-one who provided those services in the UK has been investigated or fined. . For a time Gulnara Karimova was tipped to succeed her father, Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan as president of the central Asian state from 1989 until his death in 2016. She appeared in pop videos under the stage name \"Googoosha\", ran a jewellery company and served as ambassador to Spain. . But then in 2014 she disappeared from public view. It later emerged she had been detained on corruption charges while her father was still in power and she was sentenced in December 2017. In 2019 she was sent to prison for breaching the terms of her house arrest. . Prosecutors accused her of being part of a criminal group that controlled assets of more than $1bn (£760m) in 12 countries, including the UK, Russia and United Arab Emirates. \"The Karimova case is one of the largest bribery and corruption cases of all time,\" says Tom Mayne, one of the researchers on the Freedom For Eurasia report and a research fellow at the University of Oxford. . This video can not be played. Googoosha in the video for her single Round Run. However, Karimova and her associates had already sold some of the property allegedly acquired with corrupt funds.. Freedom For Eurasia researched property and land registry records to identify at least 14 properties which it says were purchased before she arrested, with allegedly suspicious funds, in various countries, including the UK, Switzerland, France, Dubai and Hong Kong.. The report to be published on Tuesday 14 March, titled Who Enabled the Uzbek Princess?, focuses on five properties bought in and around London, now worth an estimated £50m - including three flats in Belgravia, just west of Buckingham Palace, a house in Mayfair and an £18m Surrey manor house with a private boating lake.. Two of the Belgravia flats were sold in 2013 before Karimova was detained. In 2017, the house in Mayfair, the Surrey mansion and a third flat in Belgravia were frozen by the Serious Fraud Office. . Freedom For Eurasia's report also names firms in London and the British Virgin Islands that it claims were used by Karimova or associates to enable them to spend the proceeds of crime on the properties as well as on private jetliner. . Karimova's boyfriend, Rustam Madumarov, and others now alleged to be associates of hers were listed in official documents as the \"beneficial owners\" - a legal term for the person who ultimately is in control - of companies based in the UK, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands. But the report says they were just proxies for Karimova, who used the firms to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.. Accountancy services for two UK companies linked to Karimova - Panally Ltd and Odenton Management Ltd - were provided by SH Landes LLP, a firm formerly located on New Oxford Street in London.. In late July 2010, SH Landes sought to register or acquire another company. The aim was to purchase a private jet for around $40m (£33m), with Madumarov named as the beneficial owner. In fact, according to the report, Karimova was really behind the purchase.. When asked at the time about the source of his funds, SH Landes replied: \"We believe that the question regarding his personal wealth is not relevant in this situation.\" This was seemingly because the money to buy the jet were not being provided by Madumarov out of his personal funds.. The London-based firm later said Madumarov's wealth came partly from a mobile phone company based in Uzbekistan, Uzdonrobita. Questions had already been raised about the company's possible links to Karimova. As far back as 2004, an article for the Moscow Times had alleged that Karimova siphoned some $20m out of Uzdunrobita using fraudulent invoices. A former adviser had also accused Karimova of \"racketeering\".. Because it was a high-value transaction linked to a high-risk jurisdiction, Uzbekistan, the report argues that SH Landes should have conducted \"enhanced due diligence\" - thorough background checks to ensure the source of funds was legitimate and not derived from criminal activity.. SH Landes also submitted the 2012 financial statements for Panally Ltd. The report says in September 2013 they were signed off by a close associate of Karimova's: Gayane Avakyan, then aged 30.. The previous year, the BBC had .  that Avakyan was the registered beneficial owner of Takilant, a Gibraltar-registered company at the centre of \"a high-level multi-million dollar fraud and corruption scandal in Uzbekistan\". . In a statement to the BBC, Steven Landes said: \"SH Landes LLP was never engaged by Gulnara Karimova. SH Landes LLP did act on behalf of Rustam Madumarov.. \"SH Landes LLP obtained due diligence on all its clients and relevant regulatory authorities were notified and kept appraised.\". Tom Mayne of Freedom For Eurasia said the apparent ease with which Karimova managed to buy so much UK property was concerning.. \"It took the authorities until 2017 to do anything, years after other countries had already frozen bank accounts and properties that belonged to her,\" he added. .
