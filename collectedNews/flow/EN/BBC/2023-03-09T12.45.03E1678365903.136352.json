        "content": "Ms Herman's lawsuit does not detail any allegation of harassment or assault. . She argues in another lawsuit she is owed around $30m (£25m) and was locked out of a home she shared with Mr Woods. . Mark Steinberg, a representative for Mr Woods, 47, did not immediately reply to a BBC News request for comment on Wednesday. . The civil lawsuit challenging the NDA was filed on Monday in Martin County, Florida, near where the couple had been living together. . It says that Ms Herman's agreement with Mr Woods is \"invalid and unenforceable\" due to the passage of the Speak Out Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in December 2022 and limits the enforceability of NDAs in cases of sexual assault or harassment. . Ms Herman, her lawyers say, is \"currently unsure what other information about her own life she may discuss or with whom\".. Her attorney Benjamin Hodas, did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.. The couple's break-up has not been formally announced. They have not been seen together in public since attending the US Open tennis tournament in New York last August. . Ms Herman, 38, had previously worked at the 15-time major champion's Florida restaurant, The Woods Jupiter.. A separate lawsuit she filed in October against a homestead trust held by Mr Woods alleges that she was tricked into leaving the home that they had shared in order to lock her out. . \"Specifically, by trickery, agents of the Defendant convinced the Plaintiff to pack a suitcase for a short vacation and, when she arrived at the airport, they told her she had been locked out of her residence,\" according to the court documents seen by the BBC.. That legal action says Ms Herman's personal possessions were subsequently removed from the home in Hobe Sound, Florida.. She also says that $40,000 of her money was \"misappropriated\", adding that representatives of the trust then made \"scurrilous and defamatory allegations about how she obtained the money\".. Ms Herman has been regularly seen by Mr Woods' side in the past six years, including as he was recovering from a severe car accident that, it was initially feared, could end his golf career. . ",

The main ruling party said it was pulling the bill \"unconditionally\".. Describing itself as a party of government responsible to all members of society, Georgian Dream referred to the need to reduce \"confrontation\" in society.. Georgia has applied for candidate status of the European Union and sought to join Nato. EU officials had condemned the draft legislation as incompatible with EU values. . In a statement, the EU delegation in Georgia said .  and encouraged political leaders to resume \"pro-EU reforms\".. The government's U-turn followed a second night of clashes between riot police and protesters outside parliament. Tear gas and water cannon were used to disperse the demonstrators as they chanted \"no to the Russian law\".. In its statement, Georgian Dream complained that the proposal had been unfairly labelled and said that as the \"emotional background subsides\" it would explain the importance of the bill and transparency in foreign funding to the public.. Despite the decision to drop the bill, opposition parties said they had no plans to halt the protests. They called for clarity on how the proposals were to be withdrawn and demanded the release of protesters detained this week.. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili had earlier condemned the \"stir\" over the bill. His party maintained that the legislation mimicked American laws from the 1930s, an argument also used by the Kremlin when it passed a similar law in 2012.. That Russian law has gradually intensified and now suppresses Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers, who are required to label their content with the sinister phrase \"foreign agent\".. \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old protester Luka Kimeridze.. Eka Gigauri of Transparency International in Georgia told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili backed the protesters and had vowed to veto the proposal, although ultimately the government would have had the power to override her move.. ",

        "content": " who described Topol as \"one of the giants of Israeli culture\".. Topol was Oscar nominated for his performance in the 1971 film adaptation of the musical.. His other famous film role included in Flash Gordon, Follow Me, and the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.. Herzog described Topol, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease several years ago, as \"a gifted actor who conquered many stages in Israel and overseas, filled the cinema screens with his presence and above all entered deep into our hearts\".. The actor, singer and illustrator, he added, had \"represented us with great respect\".. Israeli-British TV personality Uri Geller led the tributes, sharing a picture of himself with the \"sweet and modest\" late star, and former Israeli President Shimon Peres.. British actor and comedian . , posting: \"Anyone who plays Tevye knows he can never top Topol. God rest his soul.\". Meanwhile, Frozen actor . : \"There is no way to overstate how much this man and this performance meant to me.. \"Topol is a large reason why I became an actor. In fact, his performance of Tevye in Fiddler was the very first performance I ever saw on a Broadway stage. RIP to a great.\". Topol was born in Tel Aviv in 1935, and began his acting career in an entertainment troupe during his Israeli army service.. He rose to prominence in the Israeli comedy Sallah Shabati, which depicted the hardships of a Mizrachi Jewish immigrant family in Israel of the early 1960s, won him a Golden Globe award for most promising male newcomer.. Film roles followed in both Israel and the US, including the 1975 adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, the 1980 sci-fi adventure Flash Gordon, alongside Brian Blessed, and opposite Sir Roger Moore in the 1981 James Bond movie For Your Eyes Only.. But it was for playing Tevye, a troubled milkman in the village of Anatevka who attempts to maintain his Jewish traditions by marrying off his five daughters, that he will be most remembered.. The role, which saw him perform songs such as If I Were a Rich Man, scored him a second Golden Globe, this time for best actor.. He was on active duty with the Israeli army when he was received his Academy Award nomination - becoming the first Israeli actor to do so - in 1972. But he was granted leave so he could attend the ceremony in Los Angeles.. Speaking to Desert Island Discs in 1983, the actor said he still believed the producers \"were very brave to let me have that part\".. \"Considering that I was 30 years old, considering that my English was so limited - a vocabulary of 50 words - I still don't understand how they let me have it.\". The decision to cast Topol, instead of US actor Zero Mostel, who had made the role famous on stage, was a controversial one at the time but he later thanked his predecessor.. \"Anyone who ever plays Tevye should be thankful to Zero Mostel,\" Topol was once quoted as saying. \"He gave us all room and I know I wouldn't have done the movie without the advantage of a year's rehearsal on stage.\". Reprising the role in the 1991 Broadway revival of Fiddler On the Roof, he was also nominated for a Tony Award for best actor.. Topol would play the part more than 3,500 times on both stage and screen from the late 1960s until 2009.. Away from acting, the charitable star founded Variety Israel, an organisation that provides support for children living with disabilities and their families.. He also served as the president of Jordan River Village, a free overnight camp for sick Israeli children.. In 2005, Topol was voted the 90th-greatest Israeli of all time, in a poll by the Israeli news website Ynet. And 10 years later, he was awarded the Israel Prize - the country's most prestigious award - for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the state.. He is survived by his wife Galia and their three children.. His son Omer Topol, this week called his father an \"amazing actor who developed all kinds of tactics to cover up the problems that began to arise\".. \"When he won the Israel Prize, his Alzheimer's was in its early stages,\" he confirmed.. \"He spoke wonderfully at the ceremony, and also at other events, and no one even felt it.\".

Tyler Vargas-Andrews spoke in the first of a series of Republican-led hearings examining the Biden administration's handling of the pull-out. . He detailed a period of chaos and unpreparedness in the days after the Taliban captured Kabul. . Others spoke of enduring trauma and the moral injury of abandoning allies.. Sgt Vargas-Andrews, 25, was one of several US military personnel tasked with protecting Kabul's airport on 26 August 2021, when two suicide bombers attacked crowds of Afghans trying to flee the Taliban during the US evacuation. . Thirteen US soldiers died in the bombing, along with 170 Afghan civilians. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews testified that he and another US Marine had received intelligence about the bombing before it occurred, and that he had spotted the suspect in the crowd. . He said he had alerted his supervisors and requested permission to act but had never received it. . \"Plain and simple, we were ignored,\" Sgt Vargas-Andrews said. . In emotional testimony, he described being thrown in the air during the bombing and opening his eyes to see his comrades dead or lying unconscious around him. . \"My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearings and shrapnel,\" he said. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews called the withdrawal a \"catastrophe\", adding: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability and negligence.\". \"I see the faces of all of those we could not save, those we left behind,\" he said.. The House Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into the evacuation from Afghanistan also heard from other US soldiers and veterans who spoke of the mental health toll that the withdrawal has had on them. . Retired Lt Col David Scott Mann, who worked to evacuate Afghans at the time, testified that the experience trying to get allies out had been \"gutting\". . He added that calls to the Veteran Affairs hotline spiked 81% after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and he warned that the US was on the \"front end of a mental health tsunami\". . He said a friend he had served with had died by suicide in the aftermath. . \"He just couldn't find his way out of the darkness of that moral injury,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Testimony from the majority of witnesses placed the blame on every presidential administration since US troops were first deployed to Afghanistan, from George W Bush to Joe Biden. . Witnesses also urged immediate action to help Afghan allies who are now in limbo both in Afghanistan and in the US. . \"America is building a nasty reputation for multi-generational systemic abandonment of our allies where we leave a smouldering human refuse, from the Montagnards of Vietnam to the Kurds in Syria,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Republicans who had long pushed for an investigation placed the blame on the Biden administration.. Panel chairman Mike McCaul, a House Republican from Texas, said the withdrawal had been a \"systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level, and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration\".. In response, Democrats spoke out in defence of President Biden. . Congressman Gregory Meeks from New York said that Mr Biden had \"made the right decision to bring all our troops home\". . \"I can't in good conscience imagine sending more American men and women to fight in Afghanistan.\". Mr Biden had previously said that he bore \"responsibility for fundamentally all that has happened\", but he also blamed former President Donald Trump for overseeing the withdrawal deal with the Taliban..
