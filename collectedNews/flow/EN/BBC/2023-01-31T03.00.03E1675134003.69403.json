        "content": "The former president plans to stay in the US while immigration officials process the visa. . He is under investigation in Brazil after rioters stormed key government buildings early this month.. Mr Bolsonaro has voiced \"regret\" for the unrest, but denies he caused it.. The former president has \"devoted 34 years of his life to public service\" and would \"like to take some time off\", his lawyer, Felipe Alexandre told the BBC in a statement.. Mr Bolsonaro initially travelled to the US on an A-1 visa for diplomats and heads of state, which expires after 30 days. He came to the US ahead of his leftist successor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's 1 January inauguration. . The former president hopes to \"clear his head and enjoy being a tourist in the United States for a few months before deciding what his next step will be\", said Mr Alexandre, who works for AG Immigration, an immigration law firm. . US immigration officials received Mr Bolsonaro's request for a B1/B2 tourism visa last Friday, he said. . On 8 January, thousands of the former president's supporters attacked federal buildings in Brasília following his defeat in the 2022 general election. . Mr Bolsonaro has faced criticism for the riots where protestors, spurred by unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, broke past security and invaded Brazil's presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court. . The former right-wing leader - who has been nicknamed the \"Donald Trump of the Tropics\" because of his close ties to the former US president - has been staying at the Florida home of former mixed martial arts fighter José Aldo. . His supporters have flocked to the house in the gated community in Kissimmee, Florida, a state where a fifth of Brazilians living in the US reside.. Democratic lawmakers in Washington DC have taken issue with Mr Bolsonaro's stay in the US. In a letter sent earlier this month, dozens asked President Joe Biden to \"revoke\" any diplomatic visa Mr Bolsonaro might hold. . \"The United States must not provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions,\" they wrote. . Mr Alexandre told the Financial Times on Monday that Mr Bolsonaro \"bears no responsibility\" for the riots. . ",

        "content": "Most were poached in Etosha, Namibia's biggest national park, officials say.. Rhino numbers in Africa have dropped significantly in recent decades to feed demand for rhino horn in China and Vietnam.. Poachers killed 61 black and 26 white rhinos mainly in Etosha, where 46 rhinos were found dead, Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said.. \"We note with serious concern that our flagship park, Etosha National Park, is a poaching hotspot,\" Mr Muyunda said.. International criminal gangs now use sophisticated equipment to track and tranquilise the animals before hacking off the horn, leaving them bleeding to death.. Poaching in South Africa and Botswana has led to wildlife teams sawing off the rhino horns in order to keep them alive.  . For many generations rhino horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine despite there being no proven medical benefit. . Poaching is also being fuelled by demand in Vietnam, where horns are displayed as a sign of wealth.. The most endangered is the black rhino with just over 5,000 still alive.. However, elephant poaching in Namibia has declined from a high of 101 in 2015 to four last year.. This video can not be played. Colchester Zoo welcomes birth of Southern white rhino calf. ",

In a jailhouse interview last week, the suspect told a local San Francisco station, KNTV-TV that he was bullied and worked long hours on the farm and that his complaints went ignored. . Speaking in Mandarin, Mr Zhao, a Chinese national, told the station he has a green card and has been in the US for 11 years. . All of the victims in last week's shooting were agricultural workers. Four of those killed were shot at California Terra Garden - the farm where the suspect lived and worked. . Three people were killed at Concord Farms, where the alleged gunman had previously been employed. Six men and two women died in the shooting and the victims were all Asian or Hispanic adults..

        "content": "On Tuesday, the Canadian-born platinum blonde will tell that story herself, in both a memoir and a nearly two-hour Netflix documentary. . Anderson, 55, reportedly began working on the projects years ago, when she first learned about the Hulu series Pam & Tommy.. \"I blocked that stolen tape out of my life to survive. And now that it's coming up again, I feel sick,\" she says in the documentary trailer. \"I want to take control of the narrative for the first time.\". Here's a look inside Anderson's new book Love, Pamela (written without the help of a ghost-writer), a close-up of one of the most recognised women in the world. . Anderson was born in Ladysmith, a small town in British Columbia's Vancouver Island on Canada's western edge. . She described her childhood within the island's forested expanse, making dirt-pies and chasing garter snakes next to \"fragrant purple lilacs, sour grapes in vines strangling the trunks of tart green apple trees\". . But these idyllic scenes are cut with the loud and sometimes violent conflict between her young parents. Anderson has previously said how her father, an alcoholic, was physically abusive to her mother.. And Anderson, too, suffered harrowing abuse, recounting three separate instances of sexual violence, all before she turned 18.. In one, Anderson says she was molested by a female baby-sitter between the ages of six and 10. \"My parents thought she was generous and kind, when really, it was just a way to get them off the scent,\" she writes. \"At the time I couldn't understand any of it. She threatened me and told me not to tell anyone. Or else.\". Then, when she was just 12, a 25-year-old acquaintance raped her. Later, at 14, a high school boyfriend and a group of his friends sexually assaulted her. \"I didn't tell anybody,\" she writes. \"I just blocked it out.\". Anderson was 22 years old and working at a tanning salon when she was discovered.. Sitting with a friend at a BC Lions football game, Anderson was picked up by a roaming stadium camera, her image projected on the Jumbotron while wearing a T-shirt with the logo for LaBatt, a Canadian beer company. LaBatt took notice - quickly tapping Anderson to become a spokesperson, plastering her face on posters and in commercials. . Playboy soon followed, summoning her to Los Angeles for a photoshoot. Promoting her book this year, Anderson told the Sunday Times that she got the call from Playboy the same day she found out her fiancé was cheating on her. . \"Doing that first photoshoot gave me this little kind of portal on what it felt like to be a sensual woman,\" Anderson said. \"My sexuality was mine. I took my power back.\". The Baywatch star would go on to pose for 14 Playboy covers - more than anyone else in the magazine's history. She has said that Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was the only person who treated her with total respect. . \"As I matured, I noticed most of my boyfriends were bad - and progressively got worse,\" Anderson writes. . Early boyfriends were macho and volatile, perhaps modelled after her father. But none of them seemed to deter her desire for romance. . Anderson has been married six times to five different men. Most famous, perhaps, is the first: Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. After a four-day courtship in February 1995, the two wed on a beach in Cancún, Mexico - Anderson in a string bikini.. But what began as a dream-like fantasy came crashing down, three years and two children later. The violent end was precipitated, Anderson says, by the sale and distribution of footage of her and Lee having sex, footage that was stolen from a safe in their Malibu, California home. . \"It ruined lives, starting with our relationship - and it's unforgivable that people, still to this day, think they can profit from such a terrible experience,\" Anderson writes, saying the sex tape theft and ensuing scandal was \"one of the most difficult things I have gone through\". . Lee later served six months behind bars for kicking Anderson as she held their seven-week-old son, Dylan - violence that pushed her to file for divorce. The two have reconciled several times since. Anderson describes her relationship with Lee as maybe \"the only time I was ever in love\".. Anderson, who lives with three dogs in her late grandmother's home in Ladysmith, is a long-time vegan, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) spokeswoman, animal rights activist and campaigner for environmental protections. . That activism has led to some strange, high-profile encounters, including with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom she met while on a trip to the Kremlin for Peta. . \"Putin was only in the room once, but he heard of everything. I would get messages from other people that he was pleased that I was there - he kind of got a kick out of me,\" . . . Anderson's advocacy also led to a friendship with Julian Assange, a friendship that included several visits to see the Wikileaks founder in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought asylum.. The relationship was platonic, she said. \"We would just talk through the night and drink mezcal and laugh and tell stories.\". This video can not be played.

        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. . However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's Chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Moscow has accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. . The French President, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday echoed this sentiment - saying that while \"nothing is excluded\" when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",
