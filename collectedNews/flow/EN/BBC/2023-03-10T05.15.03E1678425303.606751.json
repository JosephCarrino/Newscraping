        "content": "Watch: Armed police storm a building in Hamburg. Police say the gunman acted alone and is thought to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among the six or seven fatalities reported by German media.. As yet, \"there is no reliable information on the motive\", police say.. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelböge street in the city's Gross Borstel district.. Police say they found a dead person at the scene who they believe may have been a perpetrator and investigations are continuing.. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. . Officers who went in found people who \"may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally\", he said.. \"The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled.\". He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued.. \"All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals,\" Mr Vehren said.. The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, at around 21:00 (20:00 GMT) telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".. Residents nearby were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.. Hamburg's Interior Minister, Andy Grote, said on Twitter that police special forces and a large number of officers had been deployed to the scene.. Police have appealed to the public not to share assumptions or to spread rumours.. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement.. The denomination was founded in the USA towards the end of the 19th century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. The headquarters of the movement is in New York.. ",

        "content": "He was charged in her murder and acquitted, but was later found liable for her death in civil court. . He died \"peacefully with family and friends\", his family said in a statement on Thursday. . A statement released by his niece, Noreen Austin, said he died from heart disease.. As a child, the native of New Jersey got his start by appearing in the Our Gang comedy series after his family moved to California.. With a career beginning in the late 1930s, he acted in classic film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and as the murderer Perry Smith in a 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood. . He also had a role on the NBC series Hell Town and was nominated for an Emmy for CBS made-for-TV movie Judgement Day: The John List Story. . Once considered among the greatest actors of his generation, his career never recovered after his arrest. . Mr Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was alone in the actor's car in the Studio City neighbourhood of Los Angeles when she was shot. . The actor had told police he had left her alone to return to the Italian restaurant where they had just dined to retrieve a gun he had left behind, and found her dead.. Four years after her death, including a year of Mr Blake awaiting trial in jail, a jury in LA found him not guilty of her murder.. Many comparisons were made at the time to the trial of celebrity OJ Simpson, who had been acquitted for murdering his ex-wife in Los Angeles 10 years earlier.. He was later ordered by a judge in a civil case to pay $30m (£25m) to the children of his ex-wife - leading him to declare bankruptcy. . He unsuccessfully appealed, but managed to get the penalty sum halved to $15m.. Mr Blake always maintained his innocence.. He had four children during his life and was married to actress Sondra Kerr for 22 years before their 1983 divorce. . In 2017 he married longtime friend Pamela Hudak, but the two divorced two years later.. ",
