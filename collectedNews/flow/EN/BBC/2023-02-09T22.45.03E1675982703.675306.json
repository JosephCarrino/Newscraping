She is now in stable condition. . Videos of Aya's rescue went viral on social media. Footage showed a man sprinting from the collapsed debris of a building, holding a baby covered in dust. .

        "content": "US military official: 'We think before we shoot'. It was equipped with multiple antennas capable of \"intelligence collection operations\", a senior State Department official said in a background briefing.. On Thursday, US lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution condemning China for the balloon. . China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes. . It has said the balloon was a weather device blown astray.. The US, however, believes the balloon is part of a wider fleet of surveillance balloons that has spanned five continents.. House of Representatives lawmakers called the balloon a \"brazen violation of United States sovereignty\" as the body voted 419 to 0 on Thursday morning to condemn its use.. Its appearance in US airspace has provoked a diplomatic crisis and led US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to China - the first such high level US-China meeting there in years. The US military used a fighter jet to shoot the balloon down over the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend.. China on Thursday said it was not aware of any wider fleet of surveillance balloons. The claim is \"probably part of the information and public opinion warfare the US has waged on China\", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.. China also took aim at US President Joe Biden after he said during a PBS interview that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was facing \"enormous problems\". Those remarks were  \"highly irresponsible and violate basic diplomatic protocols\", Ms Ning said. . The senior State Department official said on Thursday that high resolution images revealed the balloon - which was about 200 ft (60 metres) tall  - had large solar panels capable of operating \"multiple active intelligence collection sensors\" as well as antennas that were able to collect and geo-locate communications.. The US is considering taking action against groups linked to the Chinese government that were involved in the balloon's flight, the official said.. The latest US government information suggests that the craft indeed was some type of surveillance balloon, experts told the BBC. . \"The types of antennas are meant for surveillance technology and this is not something you would expect for any type of scientific mission,\" said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Civil and Systems Engineering.. It's still not possible to glean exactly what type of data China might have been trying to gather on the balloon mission, experts said, but it may have intercepted radio, cell phone and other communications from the military bases it flew over, said Matt Kroenig, the senior director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council. . The balloon's large solar panels - as well as the fact that it was able to hover over US airspace for long periods of time - is concerning, Dr Falco said. . \"They have a high-powered system that can do a lot of data relay,\" said Dr Falco. \"I don't know exactly what they were collecting, but all the mechanics are there for getting a lot of data back to their satellites.\". The US may have taken countermeasures to prevent China from gathering data, including jamming equipment, Dr Kroenig said. . The FBI said that its lab is helping process debris that has been collected, which has so far included parts of the balloon canopy, wires and electronic components collected from the surface of the sea.. Most of the balloon's \"payload\" - which would likely include surveillance gear and other items of interest to investigators - remains underwater off the South Carolina coast. Officials warn that processing the wreckage could take a long time, which could be prolonged by poor weather conditions. . This video can not be played. Watch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China row. US intelligence, military and foreign policy officials began briefing members of Congress on Thursday about the balloon.. The hearings come amid mounting criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the incident from his political opponents. . On Wednesday, an open letter from Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Roger Wicker said they lack \"a clear understanding\" of the government's response to the balloon.. Speaking to senators, US Army Lieutenant General Douglas Sims said that \"the risk of Chinese intelligence collection was low to moderate\" as the balloon flew over the US.. The potential of harming civilians on the ground if it was shot down over land, conversely, was \"moderate to significant\". . Officials also defended the timing of the balloon's destruction, saying that doing so over rough terrain in Alaska or the cold waters of the Northern Pacific would have made recovery efforts difficult and dangerous. . At a Wednesday news conference, Defence Department spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that the US believed similar balloons had operated over North and South America, South East Asia, East Asia and Europe..

        "content": "He was earlier given a standing ovation at the European Parliament in Brussels.. Several EU leaders have already stressed that a decision on warplanes would be a collective move.. Some are keen to avoid having the debate being played out in public, while there is also concern about escalation and playing into Russian narratives.. The Kremlin warned on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing.. Mr Zelensky said that certain agreements had been made that were positive but not yet public, and presidential office adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak later told Ukrainian TV that long-range missiles and attack aircraft would be supplied this year, although it was up to negotiations.. The UK said no decision on providing jets in the long term had yet been made but it would provide training for Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft it already had. . Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said his country could only act \"within the entire formation of Nato\", while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the issue had to be discussed behind closed doors. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called on EU states to consider Kyiv's request for jets quickly.. In his speech to the Parliament in Brussels, Mr Zelensky repeatedly linked Ukraine to a European way of life. Ukraine has applied to join the EU and is urging the bloc's leaders to throw its weight behind a swift course to accession, which usually takes many years.. \"Ukraine is going to be a member of the European Union,\" he told MEPs. Together with Europe, he said Ukrainians were defending themselves against the \"biggest anti-European force of the modern world\". That theme was repeated at the later summit with EU leaders, where he stressed that Europe could not be free without a free Ukraine.. The Ukrainian leader had earlier travelled from Paris with France's Emmanuel Macron, where he had also held talks with Germany's Olaf Scholz. Before visiting Paris, he had been assured by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that nothing was off the table.. Mr Zelensky said Germany and France had the potential to be \"game-changers\" in the war. The sooner Ukraine received heavy, long-range weapons and modern planes, \"the quicker this Russian aggression will end\", he explained.. Although President Macron has previously signalled some openness to providing fighter jets, Mr Scholz has not.. The French leader vowed Ukraine could count on his support, with France \"determined to help Ukraine to victory and the re-establishment of its legitimate rights\". Chancellor Scholz added: \"The position is unchanged: Russia must not win this war.\". Because of the 11-month long Russian invasion, Mr Zelensky rarely leaves his own country and a senior Ukrainian official said that the purpose of his trip was to obtain results.. He argues that fighter jets and long-range missiles are important in addition to the Leopard 2 tanks that Western nations have recently committed to supplying. While Mr Zelensky said he had discussed the issue of combat planes in Paris, he warned there was \"very little time\" to provide much-needed weaponry.. The Dutch prime minister said that many sensitive issues had to be discussed before a decision could be made on supplying fighter jets. \"The pros and cons - you have to make absolutely sure that you are not getting into an Article Five direct confrontation between Nato and Russia,\" Mr Rutte told the BBC.. Moscow has repeatably warned the West against weapons deliveries since the war began, frequently threatening to retaliate against what it calls \"provocations\".  . Asked by reporters in Moscow about the growing debate over sending warplanes to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw it as evidence of the growing involvement of the UK, France and Germany in the conflict.. \"We regret this and state that such actions of these countries lead to the escalation of tension around this conflict, prolong it and make it more painful and torturous for Ukraine,\" said Mr Peskov.. Chancellor Scholz agreed only recently to allow German Leopard tanks and has warned against getting involved in a \"public bidding war\" of weapons systems for Ukraine.. Mr Zelensky had earlier addressed a joint session of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, underlining his plea for fighter jets: \"Freedom will win - we know Russia will lose.\" . Downing Street said UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was investigating what aircraft could potentially be offered, but emphasised this was \"a long-term solution\" and that training pilots could take years..
