        "content": "In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.. One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.. Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.. He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.. No international cricket was played in Pakistan for six years following an attack on the Sri Lanka team by gunmen in 2009. It also took years for international players to return, and the ongoing tournament involves a large security operation. . \"We can't afford to risk the security and safety of the PSL,\" a senior police official told the Reuters news agency.. Officers and paramilitary rangers were seen leaving the Zaman Park suburb where the house is located, with some reportedly abandoning roadblocks and checkpoints. . Mr Khan then appeared outside and spoke to his supporters. \"The police and rangers sent to harm Imran Khan were pushed back by the people,\" his PTI party Twitter account posted.. The 70-year-old, who was ousted as prime minister last April, is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. This video can not be played. Watch: Imran Khan shows piles of tear gas cannisters he says were found inside his compound. On Tuesday, officers in riot gear fired tear gas shells and water cannon to disperse hundreds of angry supporters of Mr Khan at the compound. Some of the crowd threw stones and bricks. . Police then tried to force their way into the compound to arrest Mr Khan for failing to appear in an Islamabad court.. He has said he did not appear because of security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place there. The politician has offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in court on Saturday. . Mr Khan earlier told the BBC there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Since being ousted from office, Mr Khan has been a vocal critic of the government and the country's army. He has toured the country delivering fiery speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and blames him for an assassination attempt in November in which he was wounded in the leg.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis. Mr DeSantis is widely expected to run for president in 2024 and made his remarks in response to questions sent to possible Republican contenders. . The former congressman said continued US support of Ukraine was not among the country's \"vital national interests\".. Republican senators have lined up to criticise his comments. . Several senior lawmakers accused Mr DeSantis of dismissing or minimising alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, and said Moscow's aggression should not be dismissed.. Mr DeSantis has not officially announced his intention to challenge former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, but has been taking all the necessary steps suggesting he will do so.. In his response to a questionnaire by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, he said: . \"While the US has many vital national interests - securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party - becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\". Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko criticised Mr DeSantis's comments and tweeted his invitation to the Republican governor on Tuesday.. \"We are sure that as a former military officer deployed to a combat zone, Governor Ron DeSantis knows the difference between a 'dispute' and war,\" Mr Nikolenko said.. \"We invite him to visit Ukraine to get a deeper understanding of Russia's full-scale invasion and the threats it poses to US interests.\". While studying law at Harvard University, Mr DeSantis was commissioned as an officer in the US Navy and was assigned to its legal arm, the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps. His service as a JAG officer included working with detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, as well as an assignment as a legal adviser for elite US Navy Seals deployed to Iraq.. Fellow Republicans were not impressed with Mr DeSantis's comments, either. . South Carolina Senator and Trump-ally Lindsey Graham said the comments displayed \"a misunderstanding of the situation\" on the part of the governor. . \"This is not a territorial conflict, it's a war of aggression. To say it doesn't matter is to say war crimes don't matter,\" Mr Graham said.. Senator Thom Tillis said the conflict wasn't confined to Ukraine. \"There's a humanitarian crisis. There are war crimes being committed.\". And Senator John Thune thought \"the majority of people in this country recognise how important it is that Ukraine repel Russia\".. President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, saying Russia was intent on fighting Nazis in Ukraine.. His forces have razed entire cities and Russian troops are accused of numerous war crimes, which they deny.. Politicians from both parties in Congress have voted in favour of Western support for Ukraine, approving more than $112bn (Â£92.47bn) in 2022 alone.. The US is the largest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent - and the aid is extensive. . The US pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems, as well as training, logistics and intelligence support. . Humanitarian aid has included food assistance, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other necessities for Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. Financial aid keeps Ukraine's government operating by paying civil servants, healthcare workers and teachers.. ",

The UAE denied that conditions were poor and said it was working with the US to finish the resettlement process.. More than 10,000 other Afghans who were flown to the UAE have reportedly been resettled in the US, Canada and elsewhere, while a further 70,000 were evacuated directly to the US before American troops left Kabul.. The Afghans flown to Abu Dhabi following the Taliban takeover were housed in two converted apartment complexes known as Emirates Humanitarian City and Tasameem Workers City.. , including eight who had previously worked at some point for US government-affiliated entities or programmes in Afghanistan. . They reported constraints on their freedom of movement, lack of access to fair and effective refugee status determination, lack of adequate access to legal counsel, inadequate education for children, and no psychosocial support.. The detainees also described overcrowding, decaying infrastructure and insect infestations, according to the US-based campaign group.. One unnamed Afghan was quoted as saying that Emirates Humanitarian City was \"exactly like a prison\", while another described a \"widespread mental health crisis among residents\".. Under international law and UN Refugee Agency guidance, asylum seekers and migrants should not be detained for administrative purposes unless it is necessary and proportional to achieve a legitimate aim, and only in the absence of viable alternatives.. HRW called on the UAE to release the detainees and provide access to fair and efficient processes for determining their status and protection needs.. \"Governments should not ignore the shocking plight of these Afghans stranded in limbo in the UAE,\" said Joey Shea, the group's UAE researcher. . \"The US government in particular, which co-ordinated the 2021 evacuations and with whom many evacuees worked before the Taliban takeover, should immediately step up and intervene to provide support and protection for these asylum seekers.\". An Emirati official told AFP news agency that the UAE was providing \"high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counselling, education and food services\" for the Afghans at Emirates Humanitarian City.. They also said the UAE was continuing to work with US authorities to \"resettle the remaining evacuees in a timely manner\".. \"We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete,\" they added.. The US state department said there was an \"enduring\" US commitment to resettle all eligible Afghans, including those at Emirates Humanitarian City.. ",

        "content": "Dr Jiang was praised for saving lives after writing a letter in the early stage of the Sars crisis which revealed officials were playing down the threat.. But he endured house arrest at one point for his unwavering outspokenness. . Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide in 2003. Of these, 774 died, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. . Dr Jiang had been working in a Beijing hospital in April 2003, when he was alarmed to hear the Chinese health minister telling the public there were only a handful of cases of a new deadly respiratory disease.. The senior doctor said he knew more than 100 people had Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - in military hospital wards alone.. He sent a letter exposing the lies in the official narrative to Chinese state broadcasters, who ignored it. But the letter was then leaked to foreign media who published his account in full.. His revelations forced the Chinese government to admit it had provided false information, and spurred the WHO into action.. Strict containment measures were imposed overnight, which helped slow the spread of the virus. . His actions also led to the sacking of China's health minister and Beijing's mayor at the time.. \"I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world,\" he said about his actions.. The following year, Dr Jiang again challenged Beijing. He called on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to acknowledge its 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters had been wrong - and that hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians had been killed.. He wrote of his experience working as a surgeon in Beijing on that night. .  how authorities \"acted in frenzied fashion, using tanks, machine guns and other weapons to suppress the totally unarmed students and citizens\".. Ordinary Chinese would be \"increasingly disappointed and angry\" with the CCP's view of the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, he said. \"Our party must address the mistake it has made,\" he wrote.. He and his wife, Hua Zhongwei, were later detained, but Dr Jiang remained for years undeterred on the topic. He wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019, denouncing the Tiananmen Square crackdown as a \"crime\". . Dr Jiang was born in 1931 in the eastern city of Hangzhou to a wealthy banking family and went into medicine after seeing his aunt die of tuberculosis. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, according to South China Morning Post.. Over his lifetime he received several civil honours recognising his public stands, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 2004.. \"He broke China's habit of silence and forced the truth of Sars into the open,\" the award citation read.. Dr Jiang's experience has drawn comparisons with China's initial approach to the Covid-19 outbreak. . Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, was .  after trying to warn people of a \"Sars-like virus\" in December 2019. . After falling sick from Covid himself, Dr Li said on Chinese social media that he wondered why authorities were saying no medical staff had been infected. Dr Li died of the virus in February 2020. .

        "content": "He is understood to have spent 22 consecutive days in isolation.. Queensland's human rights chief says the case may have broken state laws. . Jack was being held on remand on charges relating to a fight with another 13-year-old boy, at the detention centre some 1,300km north of Brisbane.. He flooded his cell with water from the toilet in desperation at his situation, and after being denied drinking water, his barrister Tim Grau told the BBC.. Describing his detention as \"extraordinary and cruel\", Mr Grau said Jack had \"no serious criminal history\".. \"He was 13, he'd been in court once before. So even for this offending, he was never going to get a period of incarceration, in my view,\" he said.. Mr Grau said he didn't know why Jack spent so long in isolation, but suspected it was due to staff shortages at the prison. . \"If he's being locked in because there's staff shortages, and Cleveland detention centre has 80 or more kids in at any one time, one can only assume that other kids are in the same circumstance. . \"You would hope not, but maybe it's more common than we thought.\". Jack's period of detention included six days being held in adult prisons. He was released last week with a verbal reprimand.. A separate recent case also raised human rights concerns over the Queensland's youth justice system, which is currently undergoing reform. . In February, it emerged that another 13-year-old Queensland boy with developmental disabilities spent 78 days confined to a cell for 20 hours per day.. Queensland is currently debating new laws which would criminalise bail breaches by minors - a change which will cause the youth prison population to increase dramatically, experts warn.. State Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said the recent cases may have breached Queensland's Human Rights Act, which states all prisoners should have access to fresh air and exercise for a minimum of two hours a day.. He warned that changes to the law would only make the situation worse, and that immediate steps were needed to stop children being placed in isolation. . \"Unfortunately, I don't think they're isolated cases,\" he told the BBC. . \"Given the laws that are [being] passed in Queensland, which are clearly intended to incarcerate more children, it becomes even more important that the government urgently develops a coherent plan for preventing children coming within the criminal justice system, \" he said.. \"My concern is by increasing the pressure on the system, we risk normalising the mistreatment of children\".. Mr McDougall urged the state government to \"double down\" on measures to keep children in school and stop them going down \"the path of criminalisation\".. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were 12 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous Australians in 2021, the Queensland Statisticians Office says. . Rates of juvenile incarceration are also high, with Indigenous children accounting for some 70% of detainees across most of Queensland, and over 90% in the state's north. . Overcrowded facilities mean children and minors often have to be housed in adult prisons known as watch houses. Most juvenile detainees are being held on remand. . In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs said solitary confinement or \"separations\" were only used as a last resort. . Youth detention centres were \"complex and difficult environments, and practices used in the centres are designed to ensure the safety of staff and young people at all times,\" the spokesperson said.. \"At all times during a separation, young people have access to visits and professional support services, phone calls, education material, meal routines and recreational activities.\".
