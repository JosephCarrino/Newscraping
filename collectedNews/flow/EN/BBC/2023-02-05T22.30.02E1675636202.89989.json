        "content": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has said troops are fighting fiercely in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman, in  east.. Mr Reznikov's comments came hours before it was announced that he was to be replaced as defence minister.. Military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov will take his place, according to a Ukrainian politician from Mr Zelensky's party.. The shake-up comes amid a series of corruption scandals that has plagued the defence ministry. . Mr Reznikov has denied media reports that some defence officials are suspected of embezzling public funds for the procurement of food for the army.. Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia announced the reshuffle on Sunday, saying that \"war dictates personnel policies\". Mr Reznikov, a familiar face in Ukraine's efforts to secure Western weapons, will now become minister for strategic industries.. President Zelenksy .  as part of a broad anti-corruption drive across his government. . At an earlier press conference, Mr Reznikov said Russia did not have all of its resources ready to launch an offensive, but may do so anyway as a symbolic gesture, given the one-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February.. He said Russia was expected to prioritise taking the whole of the eastern Donbas as well as launching offensives in the south of Ukraine.. The defence minister also confirmed that troops would start training on German-made Leopard tanks from Monday.. Mr Reznikov said Ukraine had secured new long-range missiles with a range of 90-mile (150km), but they will not be used against Russian territory - only against Russian units in occupied areas of Ukraine.. \"I am sure that we will win this war,\" said Mr Reznikov, but he added that without the delivery of Western fighter jets, \"it will cost us more lives\". . Despite the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, Russia has made gains around the Bakhmut area in recent days, as Russia's army throws more and more soldiers into combat.. Russia's paramilitary mercenary group Wagner have led much of the fighting in the area.. Its head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said there are fierce battles for every street in some areas of the city, and Ukraine's armed forces were \"fighting to the last\".. Russian forces have been attempting to seize control of Bakhmut for months - making it the longest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago.. Taking the area is important to Russia as part of its aim to control the whole of the Donbas region.. It would also signify a turnaround in Russia's fortunes after it lost ground in Ukraine during recent months.. Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said: \"Things are very difficult in Donetsk region - fierce battles.\" But, he added, \"we have no alternative to defending ourselves and winning\".. The UK's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut are getting increasingly isolated as the Russians continue to make small advances in its attempt to encircle the town.. It added that the two main roads into Bakhmut were likely being threatened by direct fire.. This video can not be played. Watch: Mum turns TV up to hide shelling from daughter. ",

        "content": "The pardons come on the eve of the anniversary of the Islamic revolution in 1979.. Demonstrations erupted last September following the death in custody of a woman held by Iran's morality police.. Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab, or headscarf, \"improperly\" - in violation of Iran's strict dress code for women.. Authorities have portrayed the protests - which are still continuing - as foreign-backed \"riots\" and at times have responded with lethal force.. Human rights groups say more than 500 demonstrators have been killed, including 70 minors, and around 20,000 have been arrested.. Protests around the country have slowed considerably since the first of the hangings began.. Iran's state media says Ayatollah Khamenei's latest pardons came after a letter from the head of the judiciary framed many of those detained as young people who'd been led astray by foreign influence and propaganda. . The letter claims that a number of protesters had expressed regret and asked for forgiveness.. But those charged with more serious offences - such as spying for foreign agents, murder or destruction of state property - will not be pardoned.  . The measure will also not extend to any dual nationals currently being detained.. Under Article 110 of the Iranian constitution, the country's supreme leader has the authority to issue pardons at the recommendation of the judiciary.. This video can not be played.

Sadeq Rahimi, the deputy judiciary chief, explained that those inmates who are qualified to be pardoned must pledge in writing that they regret what they have done otherwise, they will not be freed. . According to a report by the judiciary-affiliated news agency, Mizan, Mr Rahimi said that \"for the first time ever\" defendants who have not received any final verdict will be also pardoned.. Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights . . It says that all defendants have been \"deprived of the right to access their own lawyer, due process and fair trials\".. Four have already been executed for crimes connected to the protests. . .. The pair launched an appeal before their deaths, . ",

Despite the warnings, ski resorts in western Austria have been filling up due to school holidays in Vienna.. Austrian police announced five deaths on Sunday, including that of a 59-year-old man who was using a snow plough in the western region of Tyrol. . They also recovered the bodies of a ski guide in Sankt Anton am Arlberg and a 62-year-old man who was cross-country skiing around the summit of Hohe Aifner.. On Saturday, a 17-year-old New Zealander, a 32-year-old Chinese national and a German man in his 50s - who were all said to be skiing off designated ski trails when avalanches hit - were also found dead.. In Switzerland, a 56-year-old woman and 52-year-old man were also killed by unstable snow in the south-east canton of Graubuenden on Saturday morning. Swiss police said a third member of their group managed to escape unharmed. . Avalanches are common in both countries. According to Austria's APA news agency, 30 avalanches were reported in the Tyrol region on Saturday alone - 11 of these involving people.. Austria's level four alert level means \"very large avalanches are likely\" - it advises inexperienced skiers to remain on open ski runs and trails and for experienced skiers to stay away from very steep terrain..

        "content": "He added people with \"homosexual tendencies\" are children of God and should be welcomed by their churches.. His comments were backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland.. Archbishop Justin Welby and Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, travelled with the Pope to South Sudan where they jointly called for peace in the war-torn country.. It is the first time the leaders of the three traditions have come together for such a journey in 500 years.. Archbishop Welby and Dr Greenshields praised the Pope's comments during a news conference with reporters on board the papal plane as they travelled from Juba to Rome.. \"I entirely agree with every word he said there,\" said Archbishop Welby, noting that the Anglican church had its own internal divisions over gay rights. . Last month the Church of England said it would refuse to allow same-sex couples to be married in its churches.. Expressing his own support, Dr Greenshields referred to the Bible, saying: \"There is nowhere in the four Gospels that I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whoever he meets, and as Christians that is the only expression that we can give to any human being in any circumstance\".. During the news conference Pope Francis repeated his view that the Catholic Church cannot permit sacramental marriage of same-sex couples.. But he said he supported so-called civil union legislation, and stressed that laws banning homosexuality were \"a problem that cannot be ignored\".. He suggested that 50 countries criminalise LGBT people \"in one way or another\", and about 10 have laws carrying the death penalty.. Currently 66 UN member states criminalise consensual same-sex relations, according to ILGA World - the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.. \"This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God,\" said the Pope.. \"God loves them. God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\". Under current Catholic doctrine, gay relationships are referred to as \"deviant behaviour\" and Pope Francis has previously . .. But some conservative Catholics have criticised him for making comments they say are ambiguous about sexual morality.. In 2013, soon after becoming Pope, he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but added that homosexual orientation was not.. Five years later, during a visit to Ireland, Pope Francis stressed that parents could not disown their LGBT children and had to keep them in a loving family.. ",

        "content": "Pervez Musharraf: Pakistan's coup leader who died in exile. The former leader - who was president between 2001 and 2008 - died in Dubai after a long illness, a statement from the country's army said.. He had survived numerous assassination attempts, and found himself on the front line of the struggle between militant Islamists and the West.. He supported the US \"war on terror\" after 9/11 despite domestic opposition.. In 2008 he suffered defeat in the polls and left the country six months later. . When he returned in 2013 to try to contest the election, he was arrested and barred from standing. He was charged with high treason and was sentenced to death in absentia only for the decision to be overturned less than a month later.. He left Pakistan for Dubai in 2016 to seek medical treatment and had been living in exile in the country ever since.. Musharraf died in hospital on Sunday morning. His body will be flown back from the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan on a special flight after his family submitted an application to do so, local TV channel Geo News reports. . In the statement Pakistan's military expressed its \"heartfelt condolences\" and added: \"May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family.\". Pakistan's President Arif Alvi prayed \"for eternal rest of the departed soul and courage to the bereaved family to bear this loss.\". Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed his condolences, as did the country's military leaders.. Musharraf's rule was characterised by extremes. He was credited by some with turning around the economic fortunes of the country while leader. . He was embroiled in a number of court cases following his loss of power, including accusations of failing to provide adequate security for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose assassination by the Taliban in 2007 shocked Pakistan and the world.. And his career ultimately ended in disgrace and arrest, when he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason in 2019. Though that sentencing was later reversed, he never returned to Pakistan.. Despite these events, Fawad Chaudhury, a former aide of Musharraf and currently a senior leader of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, praised Musharraf and the influence he had on Pakistan.. \"He is called a military dictator, but there has never been a stronger democratic system than that under him... Pervez Musharraf led Pakistan at a very difficult time, and Pakistanis believe the era of his reign was one of the best in Pakistan's history,\" Mr Chaudhury said in comments cited by Reuters. . However, the CEO of Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab, Mosharraf Zaidi, said Musharraf was responsible for the \"destruction of Pakistan\" during his rule. . His time in power also divided opinion in India. . Musharraf's involvement while serving as the leader of the country's army in the Kargil conflict in May 1999 - when Pakistani generals secretly ordered an operation to occupy heights in Kargil on the Indian side - caused many in India to view him as an adversary.. But in one Indian politician's eyes, Musharraf redeemed himself during his presidency. \"Once an implacable foe of India, he became a real force for peace 2002-2007,\" Shashi Tharoor, a former UN diplomat, said. . Mr Tharoor said he met Musharraf annually in those years at the UN, and described him as \"smart, engaging and clear in his strategic thinking\".. ",

        "content": "Fighter jets brought the craft down over US territorial waters on Saturday and debris is spread over a wide area.. The US believes the balloon was monitoring sensitive military sites.. Its discovery set off a diplomatic crisis, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken immediately calling off this weekend's trip to China over the \"irresponsible act\". . The Chinese authorities denied it was used for spying and insisted it was a weather ship blown astray. . Admiral Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Sunday he thought the Chinese military might have launched the balloon intentionally to disrupt Mr Blinken's trip to China. His visit would have been the first such high level US-China meeting there in years.. Adm Mullen rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\". . \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Republican politicians have accused US President Joe Biden of a dereliction of duty for allowing the balloon to traverse the country unhindered.. Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN it was a \"brazen effort\" by China to embarrass the president ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday.. The Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, Mike Turner, said the Biden administration had not recognised the \"urgency\" of the situation, adding: \"Clearly this was an attempt by China to gather information, to defeat our command and control of our sensitive missile defence and nuclear weapon sites.\". Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer confirmed on Sunday that senators would be briefed this month about the balloon and its surveillance capabilities.. The high-altitude balloon - thought to be the size of three buses - was shot out of the sky by a Sidewinder air-to-air missile fired from an F-22 jet fighter. It came down about six nautical miles off the US coast at 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT) on Saturday. . US TV networks broadcast the moment the missile struck, with the giant white object falling to the sea after a small explosion.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The debris landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - and is spread over seven miles (11km).. Explaining the decision to shoot the balloon down, a US defence official said in a statement, that \"while we took all necessary steps to protect against the PRC [China] surveillance balloon's collection of sensitive information, the surveillance balloon's overflight of US territory was of intelligence value to us.\" . China's foreign ministry expressed \"strong dissatisfaction and protest against the US's use of force to attack civilian unmanned aircraft\".. In a written statement, the Chinese government said it would \"resolutely safeguard\" the rights and interests of the company operating the balloon and that it reserved the right to \"make further responses if necessary\".. Mr Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until the object was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk.. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly paused all civilian flights at three airports around the South Carolina coast and advised mariners to leave the area.. Relations between China and the US have been exacerbated by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty.. US military officials on Friday said a second Chinese spy balloon had been spotted over Latin America. The same day, Colombia's Air Force said an identified object - believed to be a balloon - was detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. It says it followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. China has not commented publicly on the second balloon.. ",
