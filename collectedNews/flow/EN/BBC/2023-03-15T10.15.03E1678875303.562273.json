        "content": "The damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.. Russia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.. The key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . US military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.. Several times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement. . Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.. He said the jets were able to land following the incident.. This video can not be played. Watch: Pentagon calls Russia's move 'unsafe, unprofessional'. Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan. . Brig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.. The United States' National Security Council's John Kirby told CNN: \"Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we've taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone.\". Russia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\" and that it was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked.. Prof Michael Clarke, visiting professor in war studies at King's College, told the BBC the collision was \"almost certainly an accident\".. The ex-director general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute said: \"I don't believe any pilot could deliberately do that [only colliding with another aircraft's propeller] without seriously endangering their aircraft and own life.\". The incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.. To protest against the move, the US summoned Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov in Washington.. Following the meeting, Russian state media quoted Mr Antonov as saying that Moscow saw the drone incident as \"a provocation\" and that \"the unacceptable activity of the US military in the close proximity to our borders is a cause for concern\". . Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . This means the downing of the drone could conceivably have been the result of a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. . But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then analysts say that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "They are being investigated on charges of rape, people trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Both have denied wrongdoing. . Mr Tate's spokeswoman said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that his legal team would appeal.. Lawyers for Mr Tate have long argued that keeping him in preventative custody is unnecessarily harsh, when other judicial options - such as house arrest - are available.. Judges have so far disagreed, based on the perceived risk of Mr Tate fleeing the country, influencing witnesses or evidence, or that his release would disturb public order.. The request for bail in place of custody was new, but the response from the court, the same.. In late February, the court ruled that Mr Tate should remain in custody until 29 March. . On Wednesday, Mr Tate's brother Tristan will also apply for bail in a separate hearing. . Last month, an appeals court overturned all but one of the justifications for keeping Tristan Tate in detention.. No charges have yet been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.. In 2016, Mr Tate, a former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. ",

        "content": "Argentina has been in economic difficulty for years, and most of the population now live in poverty.. Its government has being trying to stem price rises by capping the prices of food and other products. . But the food and drink sectors saw the most dramatic increase recent, with prices growing by 9.8% in February compared to January.. Argentinian media said that this increase could partly be due to a sharp hike in the price of meat, which rose by almost 20% in the space of a month. Adverse weather conditions, a prolonged heatwave and a drought seriously impacted livestock and crops, said local news outlet Ambito.. Although the symbolism of the inflation rate shooting up past 100% is striking, the effects of soaring inflation have long been felt in Argentina. . Last September, protesters took to the streets to demand action to counter rising costs of living, and, in February, Argentina's central bank said that.  in response to the jump in consumer prices.. The Argentinian government has long tried to contain inflation, but divisions have marred the country's economic policy. . Last summer, three economy ministers succeeded one another in the space of four weeks as the country's economic crisis deepened, and President Alberto Fernández is said to be at odds with his deputy, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, over how to tackle Argentina's economic problems. . In December, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved another $6bn (£4.9bn) of bailout money.. It was the latest payout for Argentina in a 30-month programme that is expected to reach a total of $44bn.. ",

He is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated.. There was a tense situation outside his compound in the city of Lahore on Tuesday as police tried to force their way in. . Officers fired tear gas shells to disperse supporters of Mr Khan, who threw stones and bricks. . In a video address, the politician, 70, offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in an Islamabad court on Saturday.. He added that there were security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place at the court. . Mr Khan claimed there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him on Tuesday as he had taken protective bail until Saturday.

The former prime minister showed what he said were tear gas cannisters, which he said had been fired into his property. . He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders to arrest him over corruption cases. .
