        "content": "Watch: Armed police storm a building in Hamburg. Police say the gunman acted alone and is thought to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among the six or seven fatalities reported by German media.. As yet, \"there is no reliable information on the motive\", police say.. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelböge street in the city's Gross Borstel district.. Police say they found a dead person at the scene who they believe may have been a perpetrator and investigations are continuing.. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. . Officers who went in found people who \"may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally\", he said.. \"The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled.\". He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued.. \"All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals,\" Mr Vehren said.. The reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, at around 21:00 (20:00 GMT) telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".. Residents nearby were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.. Hamburg's Interior Minister, Andy Grote, said on Twitter that police special forces and a large number of officers had been deployed to the scene.. Police have appealed to the public not to share assumptions or to spread rumours.. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement.. The denomination was founded in the USA towards the end of the 19th century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. The headquarters of the movement is in New York.. ",

        "content": "Ministers also agreed on measures that would improve legal routes for foreign workers arriving in Italy.. The proposals came during a cabinet meeting near the site where 72 migrants died in a shipwreck last month.. Ms Meloni insisted she was determined to defeat people-smuggling at the meeting in the Calabrian town of Cutro. . \"Our response to what happened is a policy of greater firmness on the ground,\" she said, adding that Italy would act against smugglers on the boats and those in third countries who organised the trips. . The government has denied responsibility for the disaster, but Ms Meloni said that more improved and legal routes had to be opened up to allow migrants to safely reach the country. . \"I believe that another way to fight people smugglers is to send out the message that it does not pay to enter Italy illegally,\" she said.. Separately, she said countries who helped educate their citizens about the risks of using criminal networks to head to Italy would get preferential quotas for legal migrant workers.. Protesters threw cuddly bears at passing cars as the ministers were driven to the cabinet meeting in Cutro on Thursday. Some held up signs reading \"They could have been saved\".. Ms Meloni's right-wing government has faced criticism over the disaster in February, with questions raised over whether more could have been done to prevent it.. Most of those on the wooden vessel, thought to have carried 200 people, were said to be from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.. The ship is thought to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. Officials said said 72 bodies have been recovered and another 79 people survived, but around 30 are still missing. . ",

        "content": "He was charged with her murder and acquitted, but later found liable for her death in civil court. . Blake died \"peacefully with family and friends\", his family said. . A statement released by his niece, Noreen Austin, on Thursday said he had died from heart disease.. As a child, the New Jersey native got his start by appearing in the Our Gang comedy series after his family moved to California.. With a career beginning in the late 1930s, he acted in classic film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and as the murderer Perry Smith in a 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood. . He also had a role on the NBC series Hell Town and was nominated for an Emmy for CBS made-for-TV movie Judgement Day: The John List Story. . Once considered among the greatest actors of his generation, his career never recovered after his arrest. . Mr Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was alone in the actor's car in the Studio City neighbourhood of Los Angeles when she was shot. . The actor told police he had left her alone to return to the Italian restaurant where they had just dined to retrieve a gun he had left behind, and found her dead.. Four years after her death, including a year of Mr Blake awaiting trial in jail, a jury in LA found him not guilty of her murder.. Many comparisons were made at the time to the trial of celebrity OJ Simpson, who had been acquitted for murdering his ex-wife in Los Angeles 10 years earlier.. He was later ordered by a judge in a civil case to pay $30m (£25m) to the children of his ex-wife - leading him to declare bankruptcy. . He unsuccessfully appealed, but managed to get the penalty sum halved to $15m.. Mr Blake always maintained his innocence.. He had four children during his life and was married to actress Sondra Kerr for 22 years before their 1983 divorce. . In 2017 he married longtime friend Pamela Hudak, but they divorced two years later.. ",
