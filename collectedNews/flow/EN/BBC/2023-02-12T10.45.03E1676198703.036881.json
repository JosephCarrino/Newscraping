        "content": "Meanwhile, unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places. . The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 28,000.. More arrests are expected - but the action will by seen by many as an attempt to divert overall blame for the disaster. . For years, experts warned that many new buildings in Turkey were unsafe due to endemic corruption and government policies.. Those policies allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who swerved building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom - including in earthquake-prone regions. . Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.. With elections looming, .  after spending 20 years in power.. Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone, he appeared to blame fate. \"Such things have always happened,\" he said. \"It's part of destiny's plan.\". On the sixth day after the quake hit, the situation is growing more desperate. . On Saturday, German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations because of clashes between unnamed groups in Hatay province. Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.. \"There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,\" Austrian Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said. \"The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.\". The search for survivors resumed under the protection of the Turkish army.. Across southern Turkey and northern Syria, millions are homeless and temperatures continue to drop below freezing on a nightly basis. . The UN has warned that more than 800,000 people are without adequate meals, and its aid agency on the ground is warning the final death toll from the quake is likely to double.. In Syria, the death toll now stands at more than 3,500 - but new figures have not been published since Friday. . Hope of finding many more survivors is fading, despite some incredible rescues. . Among those rescued from the rubble on Saturday were a family of five in Turkey's Gaziantep province, and a seven-year-old girl in Hatay, who spent 132 hours under the rubble. . The quake was described as the \"worst event in 100 years in this region\" by the United Nations aid chief, who was in the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras on Saturday.. \"I think it's the worst natural disaster that I've ever seen and it's also the most extraordinary international response,\" Martin Griffiths told the BBC's Lyse Doucet in Turkey. . Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening.. The border crossing between Turkey and Armenia reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.. This video can not be played.

        "content": "Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track down the object which Mr Trudeau says was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.. It is the third object to be shot down over North America in the last week.. The American military destroyed a Chinese balloon last weekend, and on Friday an unspecified object the size of a small car was shot down off Alaska.. Mr Trudeau confirmed on Saturday he gave the order and had spoken with US President Joe Biden.. \"Canadian forces will now recover and analyse the wreckage of the object,\" he wrote on Twitter.. The latest unspecified object was flying over central Yukon at about 40,000 ft (12,000m) and intercepted at about 15:41 local time on Saturday, defence minister Anita Anand told reporters.. She described it as \"small\" and \"cylindrical\", but that recovery efforts are still being carried out to discover more details.. Ms Anand said it was taken out \"about 100 miles\" from the US border, adding it posed a \"reasonable threat to civil aviation\".. She said it \"appears to be smaller than the one shot down off the coast of South Carolina\" .  - meaning the giant Chinese suspected spy balloon that measured 200ft (60m) tall.. Posting earlier on Twitter, Prime Minister Trudeau thanked the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) which carries out air defence for the US and Canada and led the mission.. The White House said the object had been tracked and monitored \"over the last 24 hours\".. \"Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,\" it said. . \"The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.\". Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.. Pentagon Press Secretary Brig Gen Pat Ryder added that the FBI will be \"working closely\" with Canadian police.. Separately on Saturday, the US military also scrambled fighter jets over Montana as some airspace was closed - but it turned out to be a \"radar anomaly\" and nothing unusual was found.. The latest object's appearance over North America comes just a week after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was also destroyed by the US.. On Friday another unspecified object was tracked and shot down over Alaska at the orders of US President Biden. . In a short statement, the military said US troops, including from the Alaska National Guard, were still conducting search and recovery activities on sea ice for Friday's object.. It said it had no further details about the object's capabilities, purpose or origin but confirmed the FBI is helping with the recovery near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse.. \"Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,\" it added - and that the rescue operation will continue as weather permits.. Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.. China has denied the balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.. The US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents.. This video can not be played. Video appears to show China balloon shot down. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.. Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of \"political manipulation and hype\".. In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the Chinese balloon, maintaining that it was not \"a major breach\".. ",

        "content": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but he appeared to blame fate on a visit to one disaster zone: \"Such things have always happened. It's part of destiny's plan.\". Turkey lies on two fault lines and has earthquake building codes dating back more than 80 years. But last Monday's double earthquake was far more intense than anything seen since 1939. The first quake registered magnitude 7.8 at 04:17, followed by another of 7.5 dozens of miles away. . It required a massive rescue operation spread across 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces.. But it took time for the response to build and some villages could not be reached for days. More than 30,000 people from the professional and voluntary sector eventually arrived, along with teams from many other countries. . More than 6,000 buildings collapsed and workers from Turkey's Afad disaster authority were themselves caught up in the earthquakes.. Those initial hours were critical but roads were damaged and search and rescue teams struggled to get through until day two or day three.. Turkey has more experience of earthquakes than almost any other country but the founder of the main volunteer rescue group believes this time, politics got in the way.. After the last major earthquake in August 1999, it was the armed forces who led the operation but the Erdogan government has sought to curb their power in Turkish society.. \"All over the world, the most organised and logistically powerful organisations are the armed forces; they have enormous means in their hands,\" said the head of Akut foundation, Nasuh Mahruki. \"So you have to use this in a disaster.\". Instead, Turkey's civil disaster authority now has the role, with a staff of 10-15,000, helped by non-government groups such as Akut, which has 3,000 volunteers.. The potential rescue effort was now far bigger than in 1999, Mr Mahruki said, but with the military left out of the planning it had to wait for an order from the government: \"This created a delay in the start of rescue and search operations.\". President Erdogan has accepted that search efforts were not as fast as the government wanted, despite Turkey having the \"largest search and rescue team in the world right now\".. For years, Turks have been warned of the potential of a big earthquake but few expected it to be along the East Anatolian fault, which stretches across south-eastern Turkey, because most of the larger tremors have hit the fault in the north.. When a quake in January 2020 hit Elazig, north-east of Monday's disaster zone, geological engineer Prof Naci Gorur of Istanbul Technical University realised the risk. He even predicted a later quake north of Adiyaman and the city of Kahramanmaras.. \"I warned the local governments, governors, and the central government. I said: 'Please take action to make your cities ready for an earthquake.' As we cannot stop them, we have to diminish the damage created by them.\". One of Turkey's foremost earthquake engineering specialists, Prof Mustafa Erdik, believes the dramatic loss of life was down to building codes not being followed, and he blames ignorance and ineptitude in the building industry. . \"We allow for damage but not this type of damage - with floors being piled on top of each other like pancakes,\" he told the BBC. \"That should have been prevented and that creates the kind of casualties we have seen.\" . Under Turkish regulations updated in 2018, high-quality concrete has to be reinforced with ribbed, steel bars. Vertical columns and horizontal beams have to be able to absorb the impact of tremors.. \"There should be adhesion between the concrete and steel bars and there should also be adequate transfer reinforcement in the columns,\" explained Prof Erdik. . Had all the regulations been followed, the columns would have survived intact and the damage would have been confined to the beams, he believes. Instead the columns gave way and the floors collapsed on top of each other, causing heavy casualties.. The justice minister has said anyone found to have been negligent or at fault will be brought to justice.. Critics such as opposition CHP party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu argue after 20 years in power President Erdogan's government has not \"prepared the country for the earthquakes\".. One big question is what happened to the large sums collected through two \"earthquake solidarity taxes\" created after the 1999 quake. The funds were meant to make buildings resistant to earthquakes. . One of the taxes, paid to this day by mobile phone operators and radio and TV, has brought some 88bn lira (£3.8bn; $4.6bn) into state coffers. It was even hiked to 10% two years ago. But the government has never fully explained where the money has been spent.. Urban planners have complained that rules have not been observed in earthquake zones and highlight a 2018 government amnesty that meant violations of the building code could be swept away with a fine, and left some six million buildings unchanged. . The fines brought in billions of Turkish lira in taxes and fees. But when a residential building in Istanbul collapsed in 2019, killing 21 people, the head of the chamber of civil engineers said the amnesty would turn Turkish cities into graveyards.. More than 100,000 applications were made for an amnesty in the 10 cities currently affected, according to Pelin Pinar Giritlioglu of Istanbul University, who says there was a high intensity of illegal construction in the area.. \"The amnesty played an important role in the collapse of the buildings in the latest earthquake,\" she told the BBC. . \"We cannot go anywhere by blaming each other and we should seek solutions,\" says Prof Erdik, who believes the problem goes beyond politics and lies in a system that allows engineers to go straight into practice after university with little experience.. Prof Gorur calls for the creation of \"earthquake-resistant urban settlements\" but for that there will have to be a shift in thinking, nowhere more so than in Turkey's most populous city.. \"We have been warning about a possible Istanbul earthquake for 23 years. So the policymakers of Istanbul should come together and make policies to make people, the infrastructure, the buildings and the neighbourhoods resistant to an earthquake.\". President Erdogan has called for unity and solidarity, denouncing critics of the disaster response as dishonourable.. \"I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,\" he told reporters in Hatay, near the earthquake's epicentre. . Many of the towns and cities in the affected areas are run by his ruling party, the AKP.. But after 20 years in power, first as prime minister and then as an increasingly authoritarian, elected president, he leads a highly polarised country.. \"We have come to this point because of his politics,\" said Mr Kilicdaroglu.. Campaigning for elections expected in May has not yet begun but he leads one of six opposition parties poised to announce a unified candidate in a bid to bring down the president.. Mr Erdogan's hopes of unifying the country ahead of those elections are likely to fall on deaf ears.. He has become increasingly intolerant of criticism and many of his opponents are in jail or have fled abroad. When an attempted coup against the president ended in bloodshed in 2016, he reacted by arresting tens of thousands of Turks and sacking civil servants. . The economy has been in freefall with a 57% inflation rate leading to a sky-high cost of living.. Among the government's first actions in response to the earthquake was temporarily blocking Twitter, which was being used in Turkey to help rescuers locate survivors. The government said it was being used to spread disinformation and police detained a political scientist for posting criticism of the emergency response.. Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who spent a year in jail in pre-trial detention, wrote from exile in Germany that the aftermath of the 1999 Turkish earthquake helped propel Mr Erdogan to power. . This latest disaster would play a part in the next vote too, he said, but it was not yet clear how.. ",

        "content": "It is believed the women want to make sure their babies are born in Argentina to obtain Argentinian citizenship. . The number of arrivals has increased recently, which local media suggests is a result of the war in Ukraine. . Of the 33 women who arrived in the Argentinian capital on one flight on Thursday, three were detained because of \"problems with their documentation\", joining three more who arrived the previous day, migration agency head Florencia Carignano told La Nacion. . The Russian women had initially claimed they were visiting Argentina as tourists, she said. . \"In these cases it was detected that they did not come here to engage in tourism activities. They acknowledged it themselves.\". She said the Russian women wanted their children to have Argentinian citizenship because it gave more freedom than a Russian passport. . \"The problem is that they come to Argentina, sign up their children as Argentinean and leave. Our passport is very secure across the world. It allows [passport-holders] to enter 171 countries visa-free,\" Ms Carignano said.. Having an Argentine child also speeds up the citizenship process for parents. As it stands, Russians can travel visa-free to only 87 countries. . Travel to many Western countries has become more difficult for Russians since their country invaded Ukraine last February. . Last September, the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia was suspended, resulting in the need for additional documentation, increased processing times and more restrictive rules for the issuing of visas.. A number of countries have also suspended tourist visas for Russians, including .  that border Russia.. A lawyer for the three women who were detained on Thursday said that they are being \"falsely imprisoned\", as they are being held on suspicion of being \"false tourists\". This is a term \"which does not exist in our legislation,\" Christian Rubilar said. . \"These women who didn't commit a crime, who didn't break any migratory law, are being illegally deprived of their freedom,\" he added.. The women have since been released. . La Nacion attributed the dramatic uptick in arrivals of Russian citizens to the war in Ukraine, saying that \"besides fleeing war and their country's health service, [Russian women] are attracted by their [right of] visa-free entry to Argentina, as well as by the high-quality medicine and variety of hospitals\".. \"Birth tourism\" by Russian citizens to Argentina appears to be a lucrative and well-established practice. . A Russian-language website seen by the BBC offers various packages for expecting mothers who wish to give birth in Argentina. The website advertises services such as personalised birth plans, airport pick-ups, Spanish lessons and discounts on the cost of stays in \"the best hospitals in the Argentinian capital\". . The packages range from \"economy class\", starting at $5,000 (£4,144), to \"first class\", starting at $15,000 (£12,433).. The website says its founder has been facilitating birth tourism and offering migration support since 2015, and the company says it is \"100% Argentinian\".. On Saturday, La Nacion reported that Argentinian police has been carrying out raids as part of an investigation into a \"million-dollar business and illicit network\" that allegedly provided pregnant Russian women and their partners with fake documents issued in record time to allow them to settle in Argentina. . Police said the gang charged up to $35,000 (£29,011) for the service.. No arrests were made, but police were said to have seized laptops and tablets as well as immigration papers and significant quantities of cash.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Rescuers use specialist cameras to free Irem And Merve from the rubble of their building in Antakya. With sensitive devices they listen for any response. Everyone is frozen in anticipation.. And then, a breakthrough. \"Irem, my dear, I am close to you, you hear me, yes?\" Mustafa says. . Those of us watching can't hear it, but it is clear now that she is responding. A small group of the girls' friends wait silently with us.. \"You are superb! Now you stay calm and answer me. Ah ok, that's Merve. Merve dear, just answer my questions,\" he says.. Merve, 24, and her sister Irem, 19, were trapped under the rubble of their five-storey apartment block in Antakya, southern Turkey, which was flattened by the earthquake. It had been two days, but for them those days felt like weeks.. \"It's Wednesday. No! You weren't trapped for 14 days. Give us five minutes. You will be out.\". Mustafa knows it will take hours, but tells us: \"If they lose their hope they might not survive.\". Merve and Irem start to joke and laugh together. I can see a big smile on Mustafa's face: \"If they had space they would probably dance,\" he says.. By the rescuers' calculations it is 2m (6.6 ft) to reach the sisters but Hasan Binay, the rescue team's commander, says digging a tunnel into the concrete is a very delicate operation. One wrong move could lead to a catastrophe.. A bulldozer is called to very slightly lift and hold the thick concrete to stop the building collapsing when they start digging.. \"Girls, soon we will give you blankets.\" Mustafa tells the sisters. \"Ah no, you don't worry about us. We are not tired or cold.\". Mustafa says Merve is worried about the rescuers' situation. It is 20:30 local time and it is very cold. This area has had one of the coldest winters that people can remember.. The rescuers start furiously digging and throwing the rubble away with their bare hands.. But after a couple of hours we feel the ground suddenly shaking under our feet. It is a strong aftershock. Operations must stop and we leave the devastated building.. \"There is a brutal reality here. The safety of our team comes first,\" Hasan says.. After 30 minutes, Mustafa and three other rescuers go back to where they were digging.. \"Don't be scared. Believe me we won't leave you here. I will bring you out and you will take us for a good lunch,\" Mustafa shouts. The girls thought they had been left to die.. It is midnight now and the digging has resumed. The team have hardly slept for days. We have gathered around a small fire next to the building.. Every so often there is a shout: \"sessizlik\", meaning silence. The light goes off, total darkness now. They have made a small hole in the concrete to see if the girls can see the light coming from Mustafa's torch.. \"Merve! Irem! Do you see the light? OK! Perfect! Now I am sending a small camera down. Once you see it tell me and I will tell you what to do.\". It is a moment of elation for everyone. Hasan joins his team to see the girls on the small screen connected to their night vision camera. They can see both Irem and Merve.. \"You are so beautiful. Don't move too much. Irem pull the camera so we can see Merve better.\" . On the screen, we see that Irem is smiling. Luckily there is enough space for them between the concrete trapping them.. Relief floods everyone's faces. The girls look well and at least Irem has room to pull herself out if they make the hole bigger.. But almost immediately the team look concerned. Merve has told them that she has started to feel cold and there is something heavy on her feet.. The medics were worried: \"Do Merve's feet have gangrene? Or is this the first symptom of hypothermia?\". It is around 05:00 now. The tunnel is big enough for the slimmest team member to crawl down. The rescuer was able to reach and hold Irem's hand for a few moments.. \"Our mother's body has started to stink and we can't breathe properly,\" Irem tells the rescuers. The girls have been lying next to their dead mother for days.. It is shocking. How awful that there can be moments in life when you would not want your mother next to you, we reflected.. Hasan asks one of Merve's friends - still waiting, stressed and silent - to show them the picture she has of the girls. They are trying to estimate the width they need to make the hole. The two girls are smiling, in party dresses, celebrating a wedding.. \"Perfect! We can bring them out.\" The medical team gets ready with thermal blankets and stretchers. Everyone is excited. It is 06:30 and Irem comes first. She is laughing and crying at the same time.. \"God bless you. Please bring Merve out too. Please,\" she begs the rescuers. \"Merve will follow. I promise,\" Hasan tells her.. But bringing Merve out takes another tense 30 minutes. They need to free her feet from under the concrete without doing her harm. The operation is successful.. Once Merve is out, everyone starts clapping and cheering. I hear Merve screaming in pain but then asking: \"Am I really alive?\". \"You are dear,\" Mustafa replies, smiling.. The friends who have been here all night start shouting in tears. \"Merve! Irem! We are here. Don't be scared.\" The sisters were loaded into ambulances and transferred to a field hospital.. After this joyful moment comes a chilling one. The rescuers ask everyone to be silent again. This is the last call.. \"If anyone hears me, respond. If you can't respond, try to touch the ground.\". Hasan repeats, imploringly, from different angles. Then sadly, with red spray he signs on the concrete, writing codes so other rescue teams will not search the building.. \"Rescuing a human being is a beautiful feeling, but we wish there were no deaths.\" I can see the sadness in his face.. \"Will you eat lunch with Merve and Irem?\" I ask. He smiles: \"I hope one day we can. But the most important thing is that they are alive and in good hands now.\". ",

        "content": "Poland has been one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters since Russia invaded.. Last month, it was .  to send more tanks, ammunition and equipment to the front line.. This video can not be played. Poland's President, Andrzej Duda: \"This (sending jets) requires a decision by the allies\". President Duda's comments come despite him and President Zelensky having spoken this week - at the end of the Ukrainian leader's surprise headline-grabbing European tour. In London, President Zelensky used his speech in Parliament to call for the means to help fight Russia in the air:. \"I appeal to you and the world with the simple, and yet most important words - combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.\" . Ukraine's leader repeated that call in Paris and Brussels, in a rare departure from his country, under the tightest of security. He made headlines right around the world.. In Warsaw, President Duda told me sending F-16 jets would pose a \"serious problem\" because, with fewer than 50 of the aircraft in the Polish air force, \"we have not enough… and we would need many more of them.\" . He also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16s, have a \"very serious need for maintenance\" so it's \"not enough just to send a few planes\". . With Poland being a Nato member, said Mr Duda, any decision to provide fighter jets had to be a \"joint decision\" - rather than one for any single country to take.. There are also nerves about whether providing planes would pull Nato directly into the conflict - and even into war against Russia itself. At the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, Duda said sending jets would \"open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict\". But - in direct response to Ukraine's request for planes this week - the Polish leader's comments are significant. . As Ukraine's neighbour, President Duda has been one of the most ardent supporters of President Zelensky and has contributed vast amounts of military aid, becoming the main supplier of heavy weaponry - including infantry fighting vehicles and artillery, drones and ammunition. . Duda was also at the forefront of pushing other allies to promise to provide tanks in recent weeks. . After notable reluctance from Germany, and a fraught debate across Europe about the risks of escalating the conflict, Leopard tanks will arrive in Ukraine, along with Challengers from the UK and Abrams from the US. . Poland has also provided homes to millions of Ukrainian refugees.. President Duda is adamant that \"weaponry has to be delivered to Ukraine all the time… it needs armaments.\" But it is clear he doesn't think sending combat aircraft in large numbers is likely from Poland or any other ally, at least in the short term.. The UK also made it clear pretty rapidly that sending planes to Ukraine was not realistic in the immediate future. . Yes, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"nothing was off the table\" while he savoured his photo opportunity with President Zelensky in front of a tank this week - jeans tucked into unlaced boots, tieless, alongside the Ukrainian leader in his familiar army sweatshirt and combat trousers. . But before too long, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was making plain that would mean training for pilots and other support first. No UK jets will take off for Ukraine any time soon.. All week, British politicians have been falling over themselves to associate with the biggest political celebrity in the world right now, President Zelenksy, sharing their blurry phone snaps of his historic Westminster Hall speech and giving interviews about how moving it was to be there.. In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron greeted him like a film star in front of the Elysee Palace. EU leaders then frantically tweeted pictures of their own \"grip and grin\" moments with the Ukrainian leader later.. There is staunch support for President Zelensky without doubt. It's not just shown in flowery language and promises of commitment but, as President Duda explains, with guns, tanks and drones, plus support for refugees, rather than selfies with MPs. Western allies emphasise how countries have come together in a way that will have disappointed and frustrated Vladimir Putin. . Leaders, like Poland's president, underline the threat they feel to their own countries. Talking to him in Warsaw about the conflict is a world away from conversations in Westminster, with the Russian border at Kaliningrad only about 200 miles away. . The dilemma over jets is another example of the fraught calculations our leaders face. What is practically possible in terms of supporting Ukraine? And what is politically and diplomatically viable, without provoking a wider war?  . Poland and other countries' firm backing does not mean the West, or even Ukraine's closest allies, will or can say \"yes\" to his every request. One senior diplomatic source suggests President Zelensky is, of course, well aware of this. . His headline-grabbing journey this week was not just about the jets, and it doesn't look like it will soon result in \"wings for freedom\". But - as we approach the anniversary of Russia's invasion - his European tour's careful choreography, and powerful imagery will have reminded not just Western politicians but also their publics, of what is at stake..
