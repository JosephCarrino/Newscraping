        "content": "Watch: US official confirms downing of object over Alaska. Spokesman John Kirby said the unmanned object was \"the size of a small car\" and was over a sparsely populated area at the time.. President Joe Biden took the decision to shoot down the object, which was of unknown origin, Mr Kirby said.. It comes after the US shot down a Chinese balloon over its territorial waters last Saturday.. Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Kirby explained that the object over Alaska was travelling at 40,000ft (12,000m) and posed a \"reasonable threat\" to civilian aircraft.. He said the object had fallen into US waters that are currently frozen, adding that its debris field was \"much, much smaller\" than the balloon shot down last week off the coast of South Carolina.. \"We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,\" Mr Kirby said.. He said a fighter jet had approached the object and assessed there was nobody onboard, and this information was available to Mr Biden when he made his decision.. Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed that an F-22 jet shot down the object - which was moving at an unknown speed - with a sidewinder missile at 13:45 EST (18:45 GMT).. Mr Ryder said a significant amount of debris had been recovered so far. . It was being loaded onto vessels and taken to \"labs for subsequent analysis,\" he said, which \"will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities\".. Officials have not yet determined whether the object was involved in surveillance, and Mr Kirby corrected a reporter who referred to it as a balloon.. He did not specify the exact location where the object was shot down, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it had closed airspace in the area of Deadhorse, in northern Alaska.. No other objects of a threatening nature have been identified above the US at this time, according to the White House.. Mr Kirby said the object did not appear to have the manoeuvrable capability like the Chinese balloon and seemed to be \"virtually at the whim of the wind\".. The object was first spotted on Thursday night, though officials did not specify a time. During a second examination of the object, the F-22 jet, based out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, shot it down.. ",

        "content": "Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news. She was wearing an electronic bracelet, and was meant to be under house arrest.. \"My lawyer said 'flee, flee - they're going to put you in prison',\" she said at a press conference in Paris on Friday.. She left Moscow at the start of one weekend last year, when she judged that police would be less active, and changed vehicle seven times before approaching the border on foot.  . \"Our [last] vehicle got stuck in the mud,\" she told me, \"and we had no mobile phone coverage - we tried to find our way by the stars. It was a very dangerous and stressful escape.\". They wandered for hours near the border, she said, hiding from border patrols, before successfully making it across.. Part of that success is down to the organisation Reporters Sans Fronti√®res (Reporters Without Borders). Its director, Christophe Deloire, explained how they helped her escape.. \"I wrote my first text message to Marina the day after she went on TV with that sign,\" he told me. \"I sent her a message saying: Do you need help? We are here for you.\"  . Last September, Ms Ovsyannikova sent a message to the organisation through an intermediary, asking for their help to leave.. \"We said, OK,\" explained Mr Deloire. \"[But] she's in Moscow under house arrest, her neighbours and family are Putinists - they could call the police and say she left - and she had an electronic bracelet. So there were many reasons [why] it was an incredibly difficult thing to escape. But she made it.\". Now settled in Paris, Ms Ovsyannikova, 44, says she is still \"of course, afraid for her life\", but believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is risking his leadership over the war in Ukraine.. \"The elite understands everything perfectly,\" she explained.. \"The people are living in this bubble of propaganda, but the ruling elite - those who have lost their planes, their yachts, their finances - they understand everything. As soon as a Ukrainian victory gets closer, I believe, the ruling establishment will present Putin with a big bill.\". Ms Ovsyannikova grabbed headlines around the world last March, when she burst into a live news broadcast at the state-run Channel One TV station where she worked at the time, with a sign reading \"no war, stop the war; don't believe the propaganda; they're lying to you here\".. She said she was \"immediately isolated by the FSB [Russia's security service]\", and her bosses interrogated.. As she collected her belongings from the office, she told me that \"I saw in my co-workers' eyes a totally compassionate expression. . \"They were looking at me with wild eyes, they were saying goodbye. They thought they would never see me again.\". Ms Ovsyannikova left Russia for Germany soon afterwards, but returned later that year - to fight for custody of her children, she says.. Further protests, including a demonstration near the Kremlin in July, saw her facing charges under a new Russian law, banning \"deliberately false information\" about Russia's armed forces.  . The law made it illegal to call the war an \"invasion,\" with Russian state-controlled news organisations instead told to describe it as a \"special military operation\".. Despite being targeted by the Russian regime, many Ukrainian journalists and Russian dissidents have expressed mistrust of Ms Ovsyannikova, pointing to her earlier career as a mouthpiece for the Russian state.. Her visit to Ukraine last summer to cover the war for Germany's Die Welt newspaper outraged many Ukrainians, who demanded her immediate sacking.. ",

        "content": "He was elected governor of Khabarovsk region in 2018, unexpectedly beating the Kremlin's preferred candidate.. His detention in July 2020 caused widespread anger among locals.. The judge in Luberetsky Court near the capital ruled that Furgal, 52, must serve his sentence in a high-security prison after a jury found him guilty on two charges of murder and one of attempted murder. . The killings, said the prosecution, were linked to rivalry between Furgal and other businessmen in 2004 and 2005. . The ex-governor - who won office as a candidate for the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - struggled to contain his emotions in the courtroom after the sentence was read out, shouting \"Do you have no shame?\" at the judge. His lawyers say they will appeal.. When he was first arrested, residents in the city of Khabarovsk took to the streets in huge numbers - some estimates put the figure as high as 50,000. Such demonstrations are rare in Russia and took the Kremlin by surprise.. Furgal's supporters claimed that the criminal case against him was politically motivated - punishment for daring to beat the Kremlin's candidate in elections.. Experts say his landslide victory was the result of a massive anti-Moscow vote. As governor, he was tough-talking, and some say more popular even than President Vladimir Putin.. Contract killings of business rivals were common in Russia, especially in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when Furgal was a successful businessman.. However, the case is more likely to be linked to his unique position - as a popular local politician who didn't show absolute loyalty to the Kremlin.. \"Furgal may well have been involved in shadowy business in the past, but so too were many of the other regional leaders whom Putin has been happy to support,\" Russia expert Mark Galeotti told the BBC. \"It seems clear that this was essentially a political move: once the Kremlin decided Furgal had to go, they looked for whatever excuse they could use.\". The .  was unusual for two reasons. Firstly, it was grassroots-based: meaning the authorities could not simply arrest the ringleaders.. Secondly, it was focused on a single local issue - the arrest of the governor - making it very difficult for the Kremlin to pin the blame on the West or on \"foreign forces\" - as is the usual tactic.. But in the weeks that followed, arrests were made, and the demonstrators were eventually silenced or pushed off the streets. . President Putin appointed a new governor, Mikhail Degtyaryov, who also represents the LDPR. Mr Degtyarov, though, is a Kremlin loyalist and recently became a vocal supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.. ",

        "content": "With the war raging in neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova has been facing inflation, high energy prices, a refugee influx and Russian aggression.. The news came just hours after Russian missiles flew over Moldovan airspace.. Announcing her resignation on Friday, Ms Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage \"so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine\".. Moldova is precariously close to the war - it shares a 1,222km (759 mile) border with Ukraine, and has suffered greatly from the fallout of Russia's invasion.. \"I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,\" Ms Gavrilita said at a news conference. . \"We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in,\" she said, referring to the Kremlin. . An energy crisis was sparked last year when Russia suddenly reduced its gas supplies to Moldova, which relied 100% on Russia for gas. It caused inflation to skyrocket and there was public unrest over the high energy costs.. President Maia Sandu thanked Ms Gavrilita for her \"enormous sacrifice and efforts to lead the country in a time of so many crises\".. \"We have stability, peace and development, where others wanted war and bankruptcy,\" the president said.. She has already nominated her former defence adviser Dorin Recean - who is also pro-EU - as the next prime minister. The Moldovan parliament will vote to confirm his nomination next week.. In the earlier days of the war in Ukraine, there were fears the conflict would spill over into Moldova, or that Russia might invade it too.. That concern has receded for now, but as . , pressure has increased from Russia - which has tried to undermine the former Soviet state, and the EU's influence.. In a stark warning on Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had a plan to \"destroy\" Moldova, according to Ukrainian intelligence.. \"These documents show who, when and how Russia is going to break democracy of Moldova and establish control,\" he told EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.. \"I immediately warned Moldova about these threats,\" he added.. Moldovan intelligence services later confirmed they had also identified \"subversive activities\" aimed at \"undermining the state of the Republic of Moldova, destabilizing and violating public order.\". There are also renewed tensions in Transnistria, a breakaway territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists that runs along Moldova's border with Ukraine, and where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed.. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of trying to turn Moldova against Russia - as he claimed it had already done with Ukraine.. Natalia Gavrilita became prime minister in August 2021 when President Sandu's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won a landslide parliamentary election.. She previously served as finance minister from June 2019 to November 2019 in when Ms Sandu was prime minister.. ",

        "content": "And yet the science will go on. The insights gleaned from this event will save lives in the future.. Take a look at the map on this page. It is the most precise yet produced of how the ground lurched in response to the enormous energies that were unleashed.. The data behind it was acquired in the early hours of Friday by the European Union's Sentinel-1A satellite as it traversed north to south over Turkey at an altitude of 700km (435 miles).. The Sentinel carries a radar instrument that is able to sense the ground in all weathers, day and night.. It is routinely scanning this earthquake-prone region of the world, tracing the often very subtle changes in elevation at the Earth's surface.. Except, of course, the changes on Monday were not subtle at all; they were dramatic. The ground bent, buckled and in places ripped apart.. Researchers use the technique of interferometry to compare \"before\" and \"after\" views. But you do not really need to be an expert to see the consequences for Turkey in the latest Sentinel map.. The red colours here describe movement towards the satellite since it last flew over the country; the blue colours record the movement away from the spacecraft.. It is abundantly clear how the ground has been deformed along and near the East Anatolian Fault line.. For both the Magnitude 7.8 quake that struck first on Monday at 01:17 GMT and the Magnitude 7.5 event at 10:24, the motion is \"left-lateral\". That is to say: whichever side of the fault you are on, the other side has moved to the left. And by several metres in places.. The shocking thing is that the lines of rupture have gone right through settlements; in lots of places they will have gone right through buildings.. The Sentinel map will help scientists understand exactly what happened on Monday, and this knowledge will feed into their models for how earthquakes work in the region, and then ultimately into the risk assessments that the Turkish authorities will use as they plan the recovery.. There is sure to be a lot of discussion about how the two major tremors were related and what that could mean for further instability.. The map was processed by the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (Comet). Its director, Prof Tim Wright, said the Sentinel observations vividly brought home the scale of the forces involved.. \"News outlets always show earthquakes as 'the epicentre', as if it is a single point source (like a bomb). Actually, all earthquakes are caused by slip on extended faults, and the bigger the quake the bigger the fault that ruptured,\" he told BBC News.. \"We can map those ruptures with satellites because the ground around them is displaced, in this case by up to 5m or 6m. The rupture of the first event was 300km or so long and the second big event ruptured another 140km or so of a different fault. To put those distances in context, London to Paris is roughly 345km.. \"Damage will be highest near the fault but of course spreads over a wide region either side of the fault, too. It's absolutely horrific.\". In the era before satellites, geologists would map earthquake faults by walking the lines of rupture. It was a laborious process that naturally also missed a lot of detail. Radar interferometry from space was developed in the 1990s, and in recent years it has become a particularly compelling tool. . In part that is down to the quality of the sensors now in orbit, but it is also the result of more powerful computers and smarter algorithms. . It is possible today to get a data product on to the computers of experts, ready for analysis, within hours of a satellite making an overhead pass. Comet, unfortunately, had to wait several days for Sentinel-1A to be in the right part of the sky to get an optimal view of Turkey. But this will improve as more and more radar satellites are launched.. \"By the end of the decade, we should be able to do this kind of analysis within a day of most damaging earthquakes, and then we would be more useful for the relief effort. As things stand, we are of course outside the 72-hour window for search and rescue,\" Prof Wright said.. ",
