        "content": "Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.. He faces 30 years to life in prison without parole for each murder charge.. Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.. Alex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.. \"The evidence of guilt is overwhelming,\" South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman said as he rejected a defence motion for a mistrial. He scheduled sentencing for Friday morning.. The case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - made national headlines, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO. . Murdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area.. But the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.. Murdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.. After the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.. Reporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.. It took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case. . In a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.. \"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.. The case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial. . Instead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.. Paul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle. . For 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping. . But in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background. . On the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state. . The court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son.. Local resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter. . \"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\". Early on in the proceedings, Judge Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.. Investigators say he stole millions from clients and colleagues, including $3.7m (£3m) in 2019 alone. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft. . Prosecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.. Murdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder. . This video can not be played. Watch: Jury finds Murdaugh guilty. Several witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle. . Maggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.. Alex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns. . Prosecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.. Maggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.. South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson, said: \"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law.\". ",

        "content": "A government minister said austerity during Greece's economic crisis in the 2000s had contributed to a lack of investment in the railways.. Rail workers held a one-day strike on Thursday following the disaster, blaming government neglect. . More than 2,000 people protested for a second day in Athens and Thessaloniki, shocked by the disaster near the city of Larissa.. \"We are angry at the company, at the government and past governments that did nothing to improve conditions in the Greek railway,\" said pensioner Stavros Nantis in Athens.. Rescue workers are still going through burned and buckled carriages, searching for victims.. This was the \"most difficult moment\", rescuer Konstantinos Imanimidis told Reuters news agency, because \"instead of saving lives, we have to recover bodies\".. A passenger service carrying 350 people collided with a freight train just before midnight on Tuesday after they ended up on the same track - causing the front carriages to burst into flames.. The railway workers' strike began at 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT), hitting national rail services and the subway in Athens. . Many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".. During a visit to a hospital where relatives of the missing had gathered, Zoe Rapti, Greece's deputy minister of health, told the BBC that investing in the rail network had been made more difficult by the Greek debt crisis around 2010, which led to drastic austerity measures in exchange for a financial rescue by the EU and International Monetary Fund. . \"Of course, things should have been done during these years but, as you remember, Greece faced a big economic crisis for more than 10 years, which means that many things went back,\" she said. . She said a \"wide investigation\" would take place, which she promised would provide answers. . Government spokesman Giannis Oikonomous also said \"chronic delays\" in implementing rail projects were rooted in \"distortions\" in the country's public sector going back decades. . A 59-year-old station master in Larissa has been charged with manslaughter by negligence and is due to appear in court on Thursday. He has admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident, his lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said outside the courthouse.. \"He is literally devastated. Since the first moment, he has assumed responsibility proportionate to him,\" Mr Pantzartzidis said, hinting that the station master, who has not been publicly named, was not the only one to blame. . Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned over the crash, saying he would take responsibility for the authorities' \"longstanding failures\" to fix a railway system that was not fit for the 21st Century.. But Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's suggestion that \"tragic human error\" was to blame has caused anger. . On Wednesday night, rioters clashed with police outside the headquarters of Hellenic Train in Athens - the company responsible for maintaining Greece's railways.. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters, who threw stones and lit fires in the streets. . At a silent vigil in Larissa to commemorate the victims of the incident, one demonstrator said he felt the disaster had been long coming.. \"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.. The station master arrested should not pay the price \"for a whole ailing system\", he argued.. Many of the passengers on board were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis said temperatures inside the first carriage - which burst into flames - had reached 1,300C (2,370F), making it \"hard to identify the people who were inside\".. Local media have reported that more than 10 people are still missing, as Greece observes three days of national mourning.. Families have given DNA samples to help identification efforts, with the results expected on Thursday.. One of those, a woman called Katerina searching for her missing brother, a passenger on the train, shouted \"Murderers!\" outside the hospital in Larissa, directing her anger towards the government and the rail company, Reuters reports.. Kostas Malizos, a recently retired surgeon and Emeritus Professor at Greece's University of Thessaly, has returned to work to perform surgery on injured passengers.. \"It's a disaster, it's catastrophic,\" he said. \"Families are crying tonight. Unfortunately, the majority of the lost people are young students. They left home, happy after the long weekend, to go for their studies or to see their relatives and never reached them.\".

        "content": "'Bike desks' attempt to combat obesity in Mexico. More than four billion people will be affected, with rates rising fastest among children, its report says.  . Low or middle-income countries in Africa and Asia are expected to see the greatest rises. . The report predicts the cost of obesity will amount to more than $4tn (£3.3tn) annually by 2035.. The president of the federation, Prof Louise Baur, described the report's findings as a clear warning to countries to act now or risk repercussions in the future.. The .  in particular highlights the rising rates of obesity among children and teenagers, with rates expected to double from 2020 levels among both boys and girls.. Prof Baur said the trend was \"particularly worrying\", adding that \"governments and policymakers around the world need to do all they can to avoid passing health, social, and economic costs on to the younger generation\" by assessing \"the systems and root factors\" that contribute to obesity.. The effects of obesity's prevalence on lower-income countries is also highlighted in the report. Nine of the 10 countries with the greatest expected increases in obesity globally are low or lower-middle income states in Africa and Asia.. Reasons include trends in dietary preferences towards more highly processed foods, greater levels of sedentary behaviour, weaker policies to control food supply and marketing, and less well-resourced healthcare services to assist in weight management and health education.. Lower-income countries are \"often the least able to respond to obesity and its consequences\".. The findings estimate that rises in obesity rates around the world will have a significant impact on the global economy, equating to 3% of global Gross Domestic Product.. The report emphasises that its acknowledgement of the economic impact of obesity \"is in no way a reflection of blame on people living with obesity\".. The data published in the report will be presented to the UN on Monday.. Obese is a medical term used to describe a person with a high excess of body fat.. The report uses body mass index (BMI) to make its assessments. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height.. ",
