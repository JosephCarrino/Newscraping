        "content": "He won by 58.55% to 41.45%, a greater margin than expected.. The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a \"president for all\".. He is the first sitting president in 20 years to be re-elected.. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen, 53, said her significant vote share still marked a victory.. The ideas her National Rally represented had reached new heights, she told her supporters. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had ultimately failed, just like her father who preceded her: \"It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat.\" . Marine Le Pen took over the party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 in a bid to make it electable. She won more than 13 million votes on Sunday, on a platform of tax cuts to tackle the high cost of living, a ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in public and a referendum on immigration controls.. \"An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,\" Mr Macron said in his victory speech. \"It will be my responsibility and that of those around me.\". More than one in three voters did not vote for either candidate. . , the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969, and more than three million people cast spoilt or blank votes.. Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. Voters who said they were casting blank ballots told the BBC they wanted to punish the sitting president.. Anti-Macron demonstrators rallied in a number of cities, including Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, refusing to accept the result. . In his speech Mr Macron, 44, said his government would have to \"answer their choice to refuse to choose\". . Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. . While it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, he claimed that Mr Macron had been elected with a worse result than any other president. \"He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots.\". Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who had feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. . German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was first to congratulate him, singling out their mutual challenge in responding to Russia's war on Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also said he looked forward to \"close co-operation\" including on supporting Ukraine.. This video can not be played. While Mr Macron has played a key diplomatic role in the war, Marine Le Pen has struggled to shake off accusations of ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated him as a \"true friend\" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe. . UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.. Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars. . Accompanied by his wife Brigitte and leading a group of children, he walked to the stage accompanied by the EU anthem Ode to Joy before promising supporters that \"no-one will be left by the wayside\". Addressing voters who had backed him to keep the far right out of power he said he would be indebted to them for years to come.. The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich.. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message, when France was going through a considerable crisis involving \"many divisions and a lack of understanding\". . Mr Castex is now likely to be replaced in the next few days, and Mr Macron may ask Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne to take over. She refused to say whether she had been lined up to be the next prime minister, insisting that the focus had to be on dealing with people's worries about living standards. But a ministerial colleague, Clément Beaune, said the president was definitely keen on having a female prime minister.. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight and one opinion poll suggests 63% of voters want him to lose his majority.. If that happened, he would be forced into a \"cohabitation\" with a government led by other parties.. Mr Mélenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. . In her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the \"match is not completely over\" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high.. For now there is no talk of a change of leadership in her National Rally party. \"Everything will be rebuilt around her, she's at the head of this popular and social bloc,\" spokeswoman Laure Lavalette told French TV..

        "content": "Long queues outside supermarkets and shops were seen despite government assurances there is sufficient food.. It comes amid fears that Beijing could face a similar situation to Shanghai, which has seen some 25 million people shut in their homes for weeks. . All 3.5 million residents in Chaoyang, Beijing's most populous district, will undergo three rounds of mass testing, according to a notice by the city's disease prevention team. . The news prompted residents to rush to stock up essential supplies, with images circulating on local media showing supermarket shelves emptied of goods and snaking queues at check-out counters. . Beijing's major supermarkets also extended their opening hours to accommodate the spike in demand. . \"Never thought I would go to the market early in the morning….when I got there, all the eggs and prawns were gone and all the meat was snatched up,\" said one Weibo user in Shanghai, before adding they managed to get some vegetables. . Another Weibo user in Shanghai said: \"Seeing people in Beijing rush to buy food is both funny and distressing… it's like looking at what my own life was like just last month.\". State-media news outlet The Global Times said that Beijing's fresh food companies have been ordered to increase the supply of groceries like meat, poultry eggs and vegetables.. They also quoted health experts as saying that the results of the mass testing would indicate whether there is a need to escalate measures further, such as locking down several areas. . Separately, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, told state-media outlet China Daily that the number of cases in Beijing is expected to increase in the following days.. The latest outbreak in Shanghai, first detected in late March, has seen more than 400,000 cases recorded so far and 138 deaths. . Some of the measures Chinese authorities have enforced include .  to prevent those infected from leaving and forcibly evacuating people from their homes to carry out disinfection procedures. .

        "content": "And you don't need to look that hard to find dubious content. According to . , a website that monitors online misinformation, new users could be recommended false content about Ukraine within 40 minutes of joining the network.. While platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have been labelling false or misleading viral videos about the war, TikTok seems to be playing catch-up.. The company insists it has stepped up its efforts to combat misinformation.. Here are some of the most common categories of misleading content the BBC has identified on the platform.. From the early days of the war, fake livestreams have drawn some of the highest numbers of views on TikTok.. The recipe is simple: a user finds a dramatic video of an old conflict or some military drill, dubs fake audio of a huge explosion or an intense shootout, starts a livestream, and once a sizeable audience tunes in, asks for donations to their channel.. One such account had drawn nearly 30 million views by mid-March. All but three of the account's livestreams up to that point were short clips taken from a YouTube video of old Ukrainian military training, dating from 2017.. At one point, a fake audio track of gunshots became so popular that . .. Users can react to livestreams by sending the accounts points that can be converted into cash. . \"It seems like a lot of the looped scary livestreams were likely created with the hopes of earning money via TikTok's gifting system,\" says Abbie Richards, an independent researcher who creates videos with a focus on the dangers of misinformation.. Most of the fake livestreams can be easily found under popular hashtags such as #Ukraine or #UkraineWar.. \"The content is intended to blend in with all the other information available on the topic,\" says Ms Richards. . Dramatic footage of military video games or computer-generated imagery (CGI) has been regularly used as a substitute for real war videos.. Scenes from video games such as Arma 3 and Call of Duty have flooded TikTok. Fake aerial battles, including footage appearing to show fighter jets being shot down, have proved particularly popular.  . Some accounts try to make the action more realistic and use clips from war films, TV series or real-life games. . One video, which was viewed 24 million times, shows a man appearing to drop an explosive item on a tank. It was taken from a video of an Airsoft match - a team combat game similar to paintball - and uploaded to YouTube in January. . A separate fake livestream, viewed by 2.3 million users, is made up of CGI footage of missile strikes and has been circulating on the internet since last year. . Ms Richards says she has seen instances of users warning in the comments section of such videos that they are taken from video games or are made up. But the people behind the accounts can disable comments - and the warnings disappear.  . Videos of old conflicts are typically used when a new one is under way. The BBC has seen videos from wars in Libya, Syria and Chechnya being used as though they show the current conflict.. A video purporting to show intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces outside a block of flats has racked up 7.7 million views.. But the footage was in fact recorded in 2014 in the Chechen capital, Grozny, during a deadly attack by an armed jihadist group. Fake breaking news and live captions were overlaid on the original footage to hide the real source.. Some have posted videos from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2014, which could easily be mistaken for the current one, or footage of military exercises or parades in either country. . A video of a column of Ukrainian tanks in central Kyiv was presented as if they were on their way to defend the capital against a Russian offensive. It received nine million views. But it was filmed during an independence-day military parade several years ago.. And a video of a tank with a Ukrainian flag, speeding down a residential street - viewed four million times - also dated back to the Russia-Ukraine conflict of 2014.. Ms Richards says TikTok could address the problem of viral old videos by taking simple measures, such as making the date a video was posted clearer. . Like Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, TikTok collaborates with independent fact-checkers, albeit on a smaller scale. But while Facebook and Instagram have been labelling false and misleading content about Ukraine on their platforms, such labels are rare on TikTok.. Unlike some of its rivals, .  to academics, researchers and journalists, which Ms Richards says misinformation experts like her have been \"desperately\" demanding for some time.. What that means for independent fact-checkers is a time-consuming process of manually researching a huge volume of content on a regular basis.. Another issue, according to Ms Richards, is the absence of a community of TikTok users willing to debunk falsehoods on the platform.. \"When TikTok fails to ensure the accuracy of information receiving millions of views on its platform, that burden is falling on outside researchers and everyday TikTok users.\". A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: \"We continue to respond to the devastating war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation. . \"To support our efforts to help keep TikTok a safe and authentic place, we've added more resources to our moderation and fact-checking for content in Russian and Ukrainian, including local language experts and partnerships with independent fact-checking organisations.\" .

        "content": "Yes, presidents have retained the Elysée before. But both François Mitterrand in 1988 and Jacques Chirac in 2002 were effectively in opposition in the period running up to the vote.. In both cases, actual government was - as a result of mid-term parliamentary elections - in the hands of the president's foes. Though in office, Mitterrand and Chirac were politically impotent - but that helped when the wheel turned again and they found themselves back in favour.. As for Charles de Gaulle's victory in 1965, he'd never been elected by the people in the first place. . So, Emmanuel Macron is the first president in modern times who, after running every aspect of foreign and domestic policy for a full term, has once again won the trust of the people.. When you consider France's longstanding relationship with government - which is essentially to cheer 'em in, then chuck 'em out at the first opportunity - this is no mean feat.. He has done it by two methods, the first of which bodes well for the next five years, the second less so.. The results suggest that hidden beneath the seething mass of social media caricatures - the arrogant Parisian rich, the angry provincial mob - there are millions of French people of the middling type who feel that Emmanuel Macron has not been at all a bad president.. These people appreciate that unemployment is no longer a political issue, largely because of Macron's reforms. They think his handling of Covid was competent, and they agree that pushing back the age of retirement is inevitable.. They also discern a leader who can more than hold his own on the international stage. They are glad there is someone at the Elysée with the stature to talk straight with Putin, even if it proved a fruitless endeavour.. And they reckon that under Macron France can aspire to take the lead in Europe, at a time when his vision of greater military and economic autonomy for the EU is looking more and more relevant. The contrast on this front with Marine Le Pen could not have been starker.. These people may not particularly like Emmanuel Macron - he's too different - but enough have come to respect him.. However, the second aspect of the Macron methodology is more problematic - and this is where the caveats come in. . Five years ago, Macron made a brilliant gamble about the state of modern politics. . By straddling the centre, he destroyed the old pairing of conservatives and social democrats, and using the powers implicit in De Gaulle's Fifth Republic, he installed a highly personalised and highly concentrated system of government from the Elysée.. Opposition was forced to the \"extremes\" of left and right, where he trusted they could never really pose a threat. So far he has been proved right, as this election shows.. This video can not be played. But the election has also demonstrated something else: that more and more people in France are now prepared to dally with the \"extremes\". They do it because - thanks to the successful Macron revolution - there is nowhere else for them to go if they want to oppose him.. Many of these voters - especially the millions who chose the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon - now want their revenge on the newly re-elected head of state. . They hope they can do it at the parliamentary elections which will take place in June. But if that does not work, they dream of a social \"third round\" in September taking the form of anti-Macron demonstrations on the street, especially if he has by then launched a new wave of reforms.. Emmanuel Macron will no doubt start this second term promising a new kind of government. He'll be more of a listener. He knows there are wounds that need to heal. The trouble is that he has said that kind of thing before, and a lot of people simply don't believe him.. \"Not only has this election shown that there are two opposing Frances out there. It's also revealed a growing tendency for people to say that the opposite camp is not legitimate,\" said commentator Natacha Polony.. \"In the past elections always ended with someone who people recognised as president of all the French. I'm not sure that is the case any more.\". Your first look at exciting new drama SAS Rogue Heroes. Preview incredible new drama Life After Life. Amir and Faryal are back!. ",

        "content": "They are two of the lucky few who managed to flee the city last week. Aside from the Ukrainian forces inside the Azovstal steel works, Mariupol is almost completely under Russian control and is effectively sealed off from the rest of the world.. Any information about the conditions inside the city for the 100,000 civilians still thought to be trapped there is sporadic and difficult to confirm independently.. The couple, who have arrived in the relatively safe western city of Lviv, tell us about surviving inside the city during the fighting. But their experience of one of Russia's so-called filtration camps, the centres reportedly set up outside Mariupol to hold civilians before they are evacuated, is every bit as chilling.. Oleksandr and Olena say they ended up at a centre when they tried to escape the city. After walking 3km (1.9 miles) from their home to an evacuation point, they were driven to a Russian refugee hub at a former school in the village of Nikolske, north-west of Mariupol.. \"It was like a true concentration camp,\" Oleksandr, 49, says.. The centres have been compared by Ukrainian officials to those used during Russia's war in Chechnya, when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated and many disappeared.. Oleksandr and Olena were fingerprinted, photographed from all sides, and interrogated for several hours by Russian security officers - \"like in a prison\", he says. They worried that the Russians would look at their phones, and so they cleared all evidence from their devices of anything to do with Ukraine - including photos of their daughter in front of a Ukrainian flag. . They were right to worry. Oleksandr says that during their interrogation, Russian security officers examined photographs, phone call history and contact numbers on their devices for links with journalists or government and military officials.. \"If a person was suspected of being a 'Ukrainian Nazi', they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder,\" says Oleksandr, although the BBC has not been able to verify this claim. \"It was very dangerous and risky. Any small doubt, any small resistance - and they could take you to the basements for interrogation and torture. Everybody was afraid to be taken to Donetsk.\" . President Vladimir Putin has stated one of the aims of his invasion is to clear Ukraine of Nazis, and Russian propaganda has made numerous baseless allegations that Ukraine is somehow aligned with Nazism.. As they waited to be processed in a camp, some men offered Oleksandr and Olena a way to escape Mariupol without going through filtration. But the couple were terrified these could be Russians or collaborators.. \"We were afraid of them,\" Olena says.. Eventually they were detained and put on a list for evacuation. But the ordeal did not stop there. . \"You can't imagine how horrible the conditions were in this filtration camp,\" Olena tells us. Elderly people slept in corridors without mattresses or blankets. There was only one toilet and one sink for thousands of people, she says. Dysentery soon began to spread. \"There was no way to wash or clean,\" she says. \"It smelt extremely awful.\". Soap and disinfectant ran out on the second day they were there. Soon, too, did toilet paper and sanitary pads.. After their interrogation, Olena and Oleksandr were told they had permission to leave on the 148th evacuation bus. But a week later, just 20 buses had left the facility. In contrast, there were many buses organised to go to Russian territory. Authorities even tried to force the couple on to a coach heading east, they say. In the end Olena and Oleksandr felt compelled to seek the help of those who had secretly offered them transport out when they arrived.. \"We didn't have any choice - either be forcibly deported to Russia or risk it with these private drivers,\" Olena says.. It's a dilemma that Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, recognises. \"Many buses of civilians go to Russian rather than Ukrainian territory,\" he told the BBC, over the phone. \"From the beginning of war, [the Russians] didn't allow any way to evacuate civilians. It's a direct military order to kill civilians,\" he claimed.. Oleksandr and Olena's driver managed to get them from their filtration camp to the Russian-occupied city of Berdyansk - through \"fields, dirt roads, narrow pathways behind all the checkpoints\", Olena says, because they didn't have the proper documents to pass a Russian inspection. . They then spent three days looking for a route out before finding another driver who was willing to risk everything to get them to Ukrainian-controlled territory. He managed to get around 12 Russian checkpoints and safely deliver them to Zaporizhzhia. The couple then took an overnight train to Lviv.. \"From filtration camps you can only escape using these risky local private drivers,\" Oleksandr says. \"Fortunately, there are good people among them.\". Arriving in Lviv on the same day were Valentyna and her husband Evgeniy. They also managed to flee Mariupol last week. They were boarding a coach to a smaller city in western Ukraine - desperate for safety after their ordeal.. The filtration process was speedy for them, says Valentyna, 58, perhaps because of their age and because Evgeniy has a disability. But it was far worse for younger people, she said.. \"The filtration camps are like ghettos,\" she says. \"Russians divide people into groups. Those who were suspected of having connections with the Ukrainian army, territorial defence, journalists, workers from the government - it's very dangerous for them. They take those people to prisons to Donetsk, torture them.\". She and Evgeniy also say many were sent from the filtration camps to Russia. Sometimes people were told they were destined for Ukrainian-controlled territory, they say, only for the coach to head to Russian-held territory instead.. Like Oleksandr and Olena, Valentyna says it was only because of their driver that they managed to escape.. \"When we finally [escaped] and saw the Ukrainian fighters and the flag, when we heard Ukrainian language, everyone in the bus started to cry,\" she said. \"It was just unbelievable that we stayed alive and finally fled from hell.\". The couples' harrowing time in the camps came after weeks living through the battle of Mariupol. . Russian forces encircled and bombarded the city, slowly advancing street by street. Their eventual occupation has made it difficult to verify the conditions inside. It's only through interviews with recent escapees, such as Valentyna, Oleksandr and Olena, that details have started to emerge.. There was no running water for many and food became desperately scarce. Oleksandr and Olena sheltered in a basement near a restaurant, and so were able to survive on the tinned goods kept in storage there, with the head chef preparing food for those who needed it.. The problem, however, was water. Oleksandr describes how he had to run outside to wells in order to stock up.. \"It was very dangerous, because the Russians were shooting all the time,\" he said. Boiler water saved our lives. When we left the basement to try to evacuate, there was almost no water left in our boiler.\". Valentyna and Evgeniy recount how it was impossible to get any food except what people had saved before the war began. They survived on tinned goods, cereals, and the few potatoes they grew in their garden, sharing what they had with their neighbours.. The pair did not risk a run to the wells, knowing the dangers there. When snow came, they were ecstatic - gathering it to melt over outside fires, for drinking water.. The Russians had supplies and \"some people were going to take food from [them], those who couldn't stand hunger,\" Valentyna said. \"As for me, I wouldn't take any food from those monsters. I would rather die.\". She reserves special hatred for troops under the command of the Chechen Republic, an autonomous region of Russia loyal to Vladimir Putin. These militants have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion and are reported to have been heavily involved in the siege of Mariupol.. Valentyna accused their forces of hunting down women and children in order to rape them. \"If these girls and women refuse to do that they simply killed them,\" she said. \"I can't believe that people can be such animals. No humanity, no compassion.\". Valentyna and Evgeniy say they survived by hiding in their basement in the north of the city. They went outside only to make fires, risking shelling and shrapnel for food and warmth. Eventually their basement was also destroyed in a Russian bombardment. Evgeniy was concussed and has had hearing problems since. Their neighbour was also badly injured.. They moved between shelters and basements, before deciding they would try to flee. As they made their way out of the city they saw the devastation wrought by the Russian invaders.. \"I myself saw black, burnt, empty high-rising buildings, which were totally destroyed,\" Valentyna says. \"There were an enormous number of bodies. The city does not exist anymore. Even walls. Just huge piles of ruins. I could never have imagined such violence.\". Both couples have now escaped Mariupol, a city that has become a symbol of the resistance and the suffering of Ukraine after the Russian invasion. Now they face an uncertain future - just four of the 11 million Ukrainians displaced by the conflict.. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.
