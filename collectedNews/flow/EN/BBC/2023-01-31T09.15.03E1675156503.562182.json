        "content": "His comment comes a day after Germany's leader also ruled out sending fighter jets. . Ukraine has said it needs the jets to take control of its airspace in its ongoing war with Russia. . F-16 Fighting Falcons are widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets and are used by other countries, such as Belgium and Pakistan. . They would be a significant upgrade on the Soviet-era fighting jets Ukraine is currently using, which were made before the country declared independence from the USSR more than 30 years ago. . However, Mr Biden has repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for the jets, instead focussing on providing military support in other areas.. The US announced last week that it would supply Kyiv with 31 Abrams tanks, with the UK and Germany also . Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrii Melnyk, welcomed that announcement but asked allies for the creation of a \"fighter jet coalition\" that would also provide Ukraine with Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.. In an . , Germany's chancellor said that it \"seemed frivolous\" to discuss sending other military aid to Ukraine when they had just committed to sending the Leopard 2s. . Olaf Scholz also reiterated to German newspaper Tagesspiegel that the Nato military alliance was not at war with Russia and that it would \"not allow such an escalation\".. Moscow has accused Nato of being an aggressor by proxy and members of the alliance, including the US and Germany, have been reluctant to send military aid that could see the conflict escalate. . The French President, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday echoed this sentiment - saying that while \"nothing is excluded\" when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, it must neither further inflame the situation nor limit France's ability to defend itself. . Other EU countries, including the Netherlands, have not yet given a definitive response on whether they will send fighter jets. . However, Poland has indicated that it would be prepared to supply fighter jets in co-ordination with Nato. . This video can not be played. Ros Atkins on… Germany’s Ukraine tank decision. ",

        "content": "The warnings come after the city of Auckland was hit hard by flooding on Friday. . Four people were killed and thousands of homes have been damaged.. There are concerns that further heavy rainfall forecast for Tuesday could cause even more destruction to the city due to blocked storm water drains. . Physical attendance at Auckland schools has been suspended until 7 February in anticipation of further bad weather and the need to keep roads clear to repair critical infrastructure. . Auckland Airport, where hundreds of people were left stranded after all international and domestic flights were grounded on Friday, has sandbags and pumps ready in preparation for more potential flooding.. Parts of some major motorways north of Auckland remain closed due to large slips caused by Friday's downpour and local media are reporting that new ones are now blocking roads. . The country's new prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said over the weekend that he believed Friday's extreme weather was the result of climate change.. \"It's a one-in-one hundred weather event and we seem to be getting a lot of them at the moment,\" he said. \"I think people can see there's a message in that.\". It is the first time Northland has been put under a red weather warning, New Zealand's highest alarm - with 200mm (7.9in) of rain expected to fall in some parts of the region. . Residents in vulnerable areas have been told to prepare to evacuate if necessary. . Meteorologists also say flooding is possible in other parts of the North Island and at the bottom of the South Island. .
