        "content": "Tyler Vargas-Andrews: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability\". Tyler Vargas-Andrews spoke in the first of a series of Republican-led hearings examining the Biden administration's handling of the pull-out. . He detailed a period of chaos and unpreparedness in the days after the Taliban captured Kabul. . Others spoke of enduring trauma and the moral injury of abandoning allies.. Sgt Vargas-Andrews, 25, was one of several US military personnel tasked with protecting Kabul's airport on 26 August 2021, when two suicide bombers attacked crowds of Afghans trying to flee the Taliban during the US evacuation. . Thirteen US soldiers died in the bombing, along with 170 Afghan civilians. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews testified that he and another US Marine had received intelligence about the bombing before it occurred, and that he had spotted the suspect in the crowd. . He said he had alerted his supervisors and requested permission to act but had never received it. . \"Plain and simple, we were ignored,\" Sgt Vargas-Andrews said. . In emotional testimony, he described being thrown in the air during the bombing and opening his eyes to see his comrades dead or lying unconscious around him. . \"My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearings and shrapnel,\" he said. . Sgt Vargas-Andrews called the withdrawal a \"catastrophe\", adding: \"There was an inexcusable lack of accountability and negligence.\". \"I see the faces of all of those we could not save, those we left behind,\" he said.. The House Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into the evacuation from Afghanistan also heard from other US soldiers and veterans who spoke of the mental health toll that the withdrawal has had on them. . Retired Lt Col David Scott Mann, who worked to evacuate Afghans at the time, testified that the experience trying to get allies out had been \"gutting\". . He added that calls to the Veteran Affairs hotline spiked 81% after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and he warned that the US was on the \"front end of a mental health tsunami\". . He said a friend he had served with had died by suicide in the aftermath. . \"He just couldn't find his way out of the darkness of that moral injury,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Testimony from the majority of witnesses placed the blame on every presidential administration since US troops were first deployed to Afghanistan, from George W Bush to Joe Biden. . Witnesses also urged immediate action to help Afghan allies who are now in limbo both in Afghanistan and in the US. . \"America is building a nasty reputation for multi-generational systemic abandonment of our allies where we leave a smouldering human refuse, from the Montagnards of Vietnam to the Kurds in Syria,\" Lt Col Mann said.. Republicans who had long pushed for an investigation placed the blame on the Biden administration.. Panel chairman Mike McCaul, a House Republican from Texas, said the withdrawal had been a \"systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level, and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration\".. In response, Democrats spoke out in defence of President Biden. . Congressman Gregory Meeks from New York said that Mr Biden had \"made the right decision to bring all our troops home\". . \"I can't in good conscience imagine sending more American men and women to fight in Afghanistan.\". Mr Biden had previously said that he bore \"responsibility for fundamentally all that has happened\", but he also blamed former President Donald Trump for overseeing the withdrawal deal with the Taliban..

        "content": "Under the bill, non-government groups and media would be targeted if they take over 20% of funding from abroad.. The main ruling party said it was pulling the bill \"unconditionally\".. Describing itself as a party of government responsible to all members of society, Georgian Dream referred to the need to reduce \"confrontation\" in society.. Georgia has applied for candidate status of the European Union and sought to join Nato. EU officials had condemned the draft legislation as incompatible with EU values. . In a statement, the EU delegation in Georgia said .  and encouraged political leaders to resume \"pro-EU reforms\".. The government's U-turn followed a second night of clashes between riot police and protesters outside parliament. Tear gas and water cannon were used to disperse the demonstrators as they chanted \"no to the Russian law\".. In its statement, Georgian Dream complained that the proposal had been unfairly labelled and said that as the \"emotional background subsides\" it would explain the importance of the bill and transparency in foreign funding to the public.. Despite the decision to drop the bill, opposition parties said they had no plans to halt the protests. They called for clarity on how the proposals were to be withdrawn and demanded the release of protesters detained this week.. Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili had earlier condemned the \"stir\" over the bill. His party maintained that the legislation mimicked American laws from the 1930s, an argument also used by the Kremlin when it passed a similar law in 2012.. That Russian law has gradually intensified and now suppresses Western-funded NGOs, independent media, journalists and bloggers, who are required to label their content with the sinister phrase \"foreign agent\".. \"Again and again they are trying everything to take us far away from the European Union, European values,\" said 30-year-old protester Luka Kimeridze.. Eka Gigauri of Transparency International in Georgia told the BBC that NGOs were already subject to 10 different laws and the finance ministry already had full access to accounts, funding and other information.. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili backed the protesters and had vowed to veto the proposal, although ultimately the government would have had the power to override her move.. ",

Local police said what caused Thursday's blast was unclear. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.. But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter that the governor had been \"martyred in an explosion by the enemies of Islam\". An investigation is under way, he added.. Muzammil is reported to have led the fight against Islamic State militants in his previous posting as governor of the eastern province of Nangarhar. He was moved to Balkh last October.. Police said at least one other person also died in the attack. A number of others are reported to have been injured. Unconfirmed reports say it was a suicide attack.. It comes a day after provincial Taliban authorities claimed they had killed eight \"rebels and kidnappers\" in Mazar-e Sharif, the Balkh provincial capital. They did not, however, specify which \"rebel\" group these individuals were allegedly affiliated to.. ",
