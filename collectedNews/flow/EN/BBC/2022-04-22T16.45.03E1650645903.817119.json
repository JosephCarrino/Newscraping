        "content": "A spokesperson for the boxing Hall of Famer confirmed Tyson had an \"incident with an aggressive passenger\" who was \"harassing him\".. Police were dispatched and temporarily detained two individuals. . One person was treated at San Francisco International Airport for non-life threatening injuries.. \"That subject provided minimal details of the incident and refused to co-operate further with the police investigation,\" a spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department told US media. . Both people were released \"pending further investigation\". The department did not identify either of the individuals involved.. The attack occurred on board a JetBlue fight on Wednesday night, before it set off from San Francisco to Florida.. The video - published by TMZ - does not show the entirety of the altercation and a water bottle is not visible in the footage. . According to TMZ, Tyson had agreed to take a picture with the passenger at the beginning of the flight. But the man continued to harass Tyson, despite requests from Tyson to \"chill\".. The video of Tyson striking his fellow passenger includes audio of another person calling \"hey Mike, Mike\", seemingly trying to calm him while another person tries to push Tyson away. . It then shows the passenger's forehead, which appears bloodied. . Tyson is no stranger to violence inside and outside the ring.. In 1992, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison. In 1997, he was disqualified from a fight after biting off part of his opponent's ear. . And in 1998, Tyson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour assault following a car accident in Maryland.. Since February 2021, more than 7,000 unruly passenger incidents have been reported in the US - though 70% of them involved masking rules, according to the Federal Aviation Administration..

        "content": "Speaking from the Azovstal plant - the last part of Mariupol not under Russian control - Svyatoslav Palamar from the controversial Azov regiment said defenders had repelled waves of Russian attacks.. \"I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine,\" he said.. Earlier President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks - a maze of tunnels and workshops - and ordered his troops to seal it off instead.. \"Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot pass through,\" he said. . Much of Mariupol has been destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting. Taking the Sea of Azov port is a key Russian war aim and would release more troops to join a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region.. Capt Palamar said the Russians had fired on the steel plant from warships and dropped \"bunker-busting\" bombs on it. . The BBC has not been able to verify any of his account. But it tallies with testimony earlier this week from a . , who said fighters were outnumbered and running out of supplies.. \"All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings,\" Capt Palamar said.. The Azov regiment was originally a far-right neo-Nazi group that was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Its fighters along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers are the last Ukrainian defenders left in the city.. When asked how many Ukrainian defenders remained in Mariupol, Capt Palamar answered simply \"enough to repel attacks\".. He said that civilians were in separate locations away from fighters. They were in basements containing 80-100 people each but it was unclear how many civilians there were in total as some buildings had been destroyed and fighters could not reach them because of shelling. Entrances to some of the bunkers were blocked by heavy concrete slabs that only heavy machinery could move, he said.. \"We keep in touch with those civilians who stay in places that we can get to. We know that there are small children there as young as three months old,\" he said. . The fighter appealed for civilians to be given safe passage out of the steelworks and called for a third country or an international body to act as a guarantor for their safety.. \"These people have got through a lot already, through war crimes. They don't trust Russians, and they are scared,\" he said, adding that they feared torture and murder at the hands of Russian troops or deportation to Russia through so-called filtration camps.. Elderly civilians in the steelworks were in need of medicine while there were also about 500 seriously wounded fighters who were not getting the care they needed - including major surgery such as amputations.. \"After 52 days of blockade and heavy fighting we are running of medicines. And then we also keep unburied bodies of our fighters whom we need to bury with dignity in Ukraine-controlled territory,\" he said.. Capt Palamar said Ukrainian defenders also wanted to secure their own evacuation if possible - but there could be no question of surrender. . \"As for surrender in exchange for the safe way out for civilians, I hope we all know whom we are dealing with. We definitely know that all guarantees, all statements of the Russian Federation are worth nothing.\". He said many of the defenders left in Azovstal came from Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He himself had been married there and his child had been born there.. \"I witnessed how this city was developing. How this city became the pearl of Azov and it's a hometown for me as well,\" he said.. \"Russia is not renewing or rebuilding anything. It aims to destroy and terrorise... If we fall this horde will go further and the whole civilised world will be in danger.\" . Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing civilian shelters and of using weapons banned or restricted by international law - including phosphorus bombs and cluster munitions - in attacks on Azovstal. . Ukraine as well as the US and UK have announced investigations into the possible use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, something Russia has denied.

        "content": "In reality, though, little here could be described as normal. Normality ended on 24 February when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine for his \"Special Military Operation\".. I have experienced Communist Russia. I have lived through post-Soviet Russia. Now the world's largest country has metamorphosed again. . Let me take you on a tour of \"Special Military Operation Russia\".. I get in the car to drive to the supermarket. By force of habit, I switch on the radio. It's tuned to 91.2 FM - once the home of Radio Echo of Moscow. Echo was my favourite Russian radio station - a reliable source of news and information. . But in recent weeks all independent Russian news outlets have either been blocked or shut down.  Broadcasting now on 91.2 FM is state-run Radio Sputnik, which backs the Russian offensive in Ukraine.. Driving along the Garden Ring, I pass a theatre which has erected on its fa√ßade a giant Latin letter Z - the symbol of Russia's military operation. There's another Z outside the headquarters of Russian Railways. I overtake a lorry that has a Z sticker on the side. In recent weeks Zs have been graffitied on the front doors of Kremlin critics.. At the shopping mall, business is far from booming. Many of the shops - international brands - have shut down. Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine, hundreds of foreign companies have suspended operations in Russia. . In the supermarket, the shelves are full. Last month's sugar shortage in Russia - the result of panic buying - appears to have been resolved. But the range of products seems smaller than before. And over the last two months prices have shot up. . Outside the shopping centre, I get chatting to Nadezhda, a doctor. . \"Prices are so high, it's impossible to survive now on my salary,\" Nadezhda tells me. . \"But the hardest thing of all is living in a society that doesn't want to know the truth about events in Ukraine. People are too busy worrying about their mortgage payments, paying off their debts. They're not interested in what's going on around them. But I think that what's happening in Ukraine is terrible. I'm ashamed to be Russian.\". I drive to the Moscow engineering institute where, 30 years ago, I used to teach English. . Back in the early 1990s, after the fall of communism, my students here were full of hope that Russia and the West would forge a lasting friendship and partnership; that the future would be peaceful and prosperous. . That didn't work out.. \"We'll overcome all our difficulties. After sunset always comes the dawn,\" says Denis, a student, outside the institute. . \"But I support our troops. They are our soldiers. I am obliged to support my country come what may.\". My final destination is the giant war museum that celebrates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two - a glorious victory, achieved at enormous human cost. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. . What I find disturbing is how the \"Special Military Operation\" has found a place in this museum, how it's being honoured here. . On the museum's website, the spelling of the word \"museum\" has been altered to feature the letter Z. In the museum shop you can buy Z mugs and badges declaring \"Putin is My PreZident\". . And the museum is currently hosting an exhibition about Nazis in Ukraine. That helps to cement the Kremlin's bogus claim that the Russian army is liberating Ukraine from Nazism. . This is \"Special Military Operation Russia\" - a parallel universe, Orwellian, where invasion is liberation, where aggression is self-defence and where critics are traitors.. It feels like the Russia I have known for the last 30 years has gone.. This video can not be played. The final days of the dinosaurs brought to life by David Attenborough.

President Kenyatta, defeated by Mr Kibaki in 2002, led the tribute to his former rival, saying he had \"led the charge to keep the ruling party accountable\".. Mr Kibaki had \"earned the abiding respect and affection\" of this nation, the president continued.. Mr Kenyatta declared a mourning period until Mr Kibaki's burial, with flags flying at half-mast. He will be given a state funeral with full military honours, President Kenyatta said.. This video can not be played. Many Kenyans are expressing a real sense of loss and regard Mr Kibaki as the best president Kenya has had since independence.  . He was a sharp economist who set the country on a path of economic growth. He held a number of senior positions in treasury and government in his political career that spanned decades. . Politically, however, he was regarded as a non-confrontational fence-sitter and opportunist. He opposed the introduction of multiparty democracy but jumped ship after the constitution was amended. He then embraced it, formed his own political party and, 10 years later, went on to win the election as head of an opposition coalition.  . Both traits would be seen during his tenure as president. Kenya recorded one of its highest rates of GDP growth during his first term, before the violence of the 2007 election severely dented his legacy. . As well as his economic record, one of his biggest achievements was to introduce free primary education to Kenya.. He also introduced a new constitution in 2010, after it was overwhelmingly approved in a national referendum. It was billed by some at the time as the most important political event in Kenya's history since it gained independence from Britain in 1963. . It introduced a more decentralised political system and limited presidential powers.. His biggest failure was the fight against corruption. He'd promised to fight it, but his government was rocked by major corruption scandals.  . But the 2007-2008 election violence after a disputed vote was the worst in the country's history and the lowest point of his presidency. Not only were more than 1,200 lives lost, but more than half a million people were forced from their homes.. During the violence there were hundreds of rapes and more than 100,000 properties were destroyed, according to the International Criminal Court (ICC). It charged leading politicians with orchestrating the violence but neither Mr Kibaki nor opposition leader Raila Odinga was among them. . The electoral commission, under tight police security, declared Mr Kibaki the winner of the vote, although Mr Odinga alleged widespread fraud. President Kibaki was sworn in hurriedly for the second term as the country descended into violence. . An investigation led by former South African judge Johann Krieglar determined that both sides had participated in electoral malpractices in different regions which made it impossible to determine who had won that election. . The violence was eventually ended in a power-sharing deal brokered by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, which saw Mr Odinga become prime minister.. Mr Odinga has joined those mourning the death of his former rival, describing it as \"a very sad occasion for the nation\" and saying Mr Kibacki had \"served this country for many years with diligence, with fortitude, with honesty and transparency\"..
