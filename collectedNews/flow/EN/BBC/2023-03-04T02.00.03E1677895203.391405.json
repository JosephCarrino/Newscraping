        "content": "Watch: Murdaugh's defiant last words as judge calls him a \"monster\". The hearing in South Carolina came one day after a jury took less than three hours to convict the 54-year-old. . Murdaugh's wife, Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22, were shot at close range on their family estate on 7 June 2021.. Prosecutors argued he killed his wife and son to divert attention from his financial crimes and gain sympathy.. Judge Clifton Newman called the case \"one of the most troubling\" he had seen and noted Murdaugh's past \"as a well-known member of the legal community\".. \"You've practised law before me, and we've seen each other at various occasions throughout the years,\" he said, calling it \"especially heart-breaking for me\" to learn of Murdaugh's arrest and prosecution, more than a year after the murders were committed. . Alex Murdaugh headed a legal dynasty that for decades had occupied a powerful place - the jurisdiction was described by some as \"Murdaugh Country\".. Judge Newman said he understood the decision by the state not to seek the death penalty, but noted that Murdaugh's own family had had people executed for less.  . \"Your family, including you, have been prosecuting people here in this courtroom, and many have received the death penalty, probably for lesser conduct,\" he said.. The disbarred attorney was convicted of two counts of murder after a six-week trial.. During the trial, investigators revealed how Murdaugh stole nearly $9m from clients, to fund an addiction to painkillers and a lavish lifestyle. . At Friday's sentencing, Murdaugh spoke briefly twice, to maintain his innocence. His lawyers said they would appeal against the life terms within 10 days. . Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, dressed in a simple navy-blue blazer, sat still and silent throughout the proceedings - even as the judge sentenced his father to two consecutive life sentences.. The judge also suggested the murders may have been carried out under the influence of the drugs.. \"It might not have been you, but it may have been the monster you became when you took those pills.\". This video can not be played. Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said the evidence against the South Carolina lawyer was \"overwhelming\" and showed him to be a \"cunning, manipulative man who placed himself above all others, including his family\".. Murdaugh, meanwhile, restated his claim that he was not guilty.. \"I would never hurt my wife and I would never hurt my son,\" he said in brief remarks at the hearing. He stared ahead and did not react as his sentence was read. . A video filmed by Paul Murdaugh just minutes before he was shot featured the voice of his father in the background, dramatically contradicting his claim he was not there at the time.. A juror who convicted him told ABC News that was the moment he began to suspect the defendant was guilty.. During a news conference after the sentence was handed down, Murdaugh's lawyers said they did not believe it was a mistake for him to take the stand during the trial. They called Judge Newman's decision to allow evidence related to Murdaugh's financial crimes to be included in the murder trial \"erroneous\". . The state's case \"was about character, not about motive\", defence attorney Dick Harpootlian said. Murdaugh had been cast as a \"despicable human being\", he said.. The high-profile case has captured national attention and sparked true crime podcasts and documentaries.. ",

Police found the note during a covert operation at his sister Rosalia's house - one month before his arrest in the Sicilian capital Palermo in January.. Rosalia Messina Denaro was also arrested in Sicily on Friday.. Her brother, 60, spent 30 years on the run and is believed to have evaded justice with help from family.. He is alleged to be a boss of the notorious Cosa Nostra Mafia and was tried and sentenced to life in prison in absentia in 2002 of a string of murders. . He was eventually . , where he had been receiving treatment for cancer under a fake identity, on 16 January. . More than 100 members of the armed forces were involved in his arrest.. Rosalia Messina Denaro, 67, also known as Rosetta, was herself detained in Sicily on mafia membership charges on Friday, with the Carabinieri - Italian police - releasing a 57-page arrest warrant detailing some of the circumstances which led to her brother's earlier arrest. . The warrant reveals that police found a note inside the leg of an aluminium chair in Rosalia's home in the town of Castelvetrano, in the west of the island, while trying to plant a listening device inside during an operation in December.. Officers photographed the note, which initially seemed like a jumble of words, signs and letters, and replaced it where it was found. . The note was in fact a pizzino - a small piece of paper written in code used by Messina Denaro to communicate with his relatives and affiliates.. Analysis showed it documented a man's struggle with colon cancer, with police focusing their attention on Messina Denaro after verifying that no other family members had similar cancer diagnoses. . The \"historic result of the capture... originated from a note, imprudently kept, albeit hidden, by Rosetta\", a judge wrote in the warrant.. She is alleged to have played a major role in her mafia family, acting as treasurer, with police saying she communicated with her brother using the code name \"Fragolone\", or \"big strawberry\".. The warrant described Rosalia as a woman with \"origins and traditions all inspired by an orthodox and rock-hard mafia culture\". . The warrant says she is under investigation for being part of the mafia organisation and committing crimes through her membership, helping her brother escape numerous jail sentences, helping him continue in his role as boss of the organisation, and making sure other members of the organisation could communicate with him while he was hiding from the authorities..

The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), a nonpartisan watchdog, issued a .  on Thursday that says the Democratic politician was provided with the dress, a handbag, shoes and jewellery for the event. She also received hair, makeup and transportation services as well as the use of a hotel room for the event.. \"While Rep. Ocasio-Cortez appears to have now paid for the rental value of the attire she wore to the Met Gala and for the goods and services she and her partner received in connection with this September 2021 event, payment for these goods and services did not occur until after the OCE contacted her in connection with this review,\" the OCE said in a report released on Thursday.. \"If Rep.

        "content": "Watch: Police held hostage in Colombia protest. Violence erupted on Thursday after residents blockaded the compound of the oil exploration company Emerald Energy.. They were demanding its help to repair and build new roads in the area.. A civilian was also killed and nine oilfield workers captured alongside the police officers. Video showed the hostages sitting in a crowded room on rows of chairs and on the floor.. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he hoped they would be \"unilaterally\" released before any escalation of violence, and asked for medical help from the Red Cross.. Many of the protesters are rural and indigenous people who want Emerald Energy to build new road infrastructure around the San Vicente del Caguan area.. The oil company did not respond when approached by Reuters news agency for comment.. Colombian police paid tribute on Twitter to the police officer killed in the clash, who they named as Ricardo Monroy.. \"Today we are more united than ever,\" they wrote, adding that Mr Monroy had \"offered his life in the line of duty\".. Local government officials said the officer died from a machete attack, while the civilian was killed by gunfire.. Colombia's human rights ombudsman Carlos Camargo - who was on site to mediate - said he had spoken to protesters and stopped them from throwing petrol bombs at the oil facility.. Protests in areas near energy and mining operations in Colombia are common as communities demand companies build infrastructure, including roads and schools.. Police said a dissident subgroup of Farc rebels which rejected the 2016 peace deal were present in the region and may have been provoking the unrest.. Separately, Mr Petro on Thursday unexpectedly published a statement on Twitter asking the country's prosecutor general to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption involving his own son and brother.. The statement did not specify the accusations against his eldest son, Nicolas Petro Burgos, and brother, Juan Fernando Petro Urrego, but it did say: \"my government will not give out benefits to criminals in exchange for bribes\". .

Mr Bialiatski was one of three winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.. He was arrested in 2021 following .  the previous year, and accused of smuggling cash into Belarus to fund opposition activity.. Demonstrators were met with police brutality and Lukashenko critics .  during the demonstrations, which started in 2020.. Mr Bialiatski was in court alongside two fellow campaigners, Valentin Stefanovich and Vladimir Labkovich. . Mr Stefanovich was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Mr Labkovich received seven years, according to Viasna, the group Mr Bialiatski founded in 1996. . All three had pleaded not guilty. . Mr Bialiatski's wife, Natalya Pinchuk, said the trial was \"obviously against human rights defenders for their human rights work\", describing it as a \"cruel\" verdict. . Referring to her husband's letters from prison, where he has been held since arrest, she said: \"He always writes that everything is fine. He doesn't complain about his health - he tries not to upset me.\" . Kostya Staradubets, a spokesperson for Viasna, said the sentences imposed on the three activists were \"breaking our hearts\". . Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, he said: \"We knew that our three colleagues would get long prison terms but anyway it's still a shock, it's breaking our hearts, not only the [prison] terms are long but the conditions also very horrific.. \"We call [the conditions] torture actually because they're being held for several months in a 19th Century building, poorly lit cells with no fresh air, no sunlight, poor food, little or no healthcare.\" .
