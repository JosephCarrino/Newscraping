        "content": "Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia.. Russian energy giant Gazprom operates a facility near the village of Gubastovo, about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, where the drone crashed.. Gazprom told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that its operations in the Kolomna district had not been interrupted.. The target of the drone in Kolomna \"was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, which was not damaged\", Mr Vorobyov posted on Telegram. . \"There are no casualties or damage on the ground. The FSB (Russian security service) and other competent authorities are investigating,\" he added.. Images shared by Russian media and officials show a damaged drone in a snow-covered field in front of a forest of birch trees. The area around the Gazprom facility is heavily forested.. The appearance of the drone matches that of the UJ-22 Airborne, a product of Ukrainian manufacturer Ukrjet.. Ukrjet says the vehicle has a range of 800km - enough for it to reach the Kolomna area from Ukraine.. A reverse image reveals no previous matches for the image, suggesting it is recent.. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, tweeted a photo of the drone. . \"It is more than 500km away from Russian border with Ukraine. Soon Putin might get very afraid to show himself in public as drones can reach far distances,\" he wrote alongside the photo.. If Ukraine was behind the Kolomna drone, it would be the closest attempted drone attack to the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.. It came as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had downed two Ukrainian drones in southern Russia.. The ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to use drones \"to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar region and the Adygea Republic\", adding that they were \"neutralised by electronic warfare units\".. Moscow has accused Ukraine of being behind attacks on Russian military infrastructure during the war, but Kyiv has not confirmed this. .  left three people dead, Moscow said. The Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.. Just weeks before, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the same airfield, which is home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine.. In August, a series of blasts rocked a military base in Crimea, in what was seen as a significant expansion of the conflict by Ukraine into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . President Vladimir Putin told the FSB on Tuesday to intensify its activity against what he said was increasing espionage and sabotage by Ukraine and the West.. He instructed the FSB to strengthen security in territories occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He said units deployed at the border must stop sabotage groups and prevent the passage of illegal weapons and ammunition.   . \"We need to beef up our counterintelligence in general, because Western special services have traditionally been very active in relation to Russia,\" he said.. \"And now they have put in additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly.\". Russia's defence ministry said its fighter jets were involved in a training exercise in the country's western airspace on Tuesday, hours after airspace over St Petersburg was closed due to reports of an unidentified object..

He had put the remains in the bag to show them off to his friends, he said. . He explained that he kept \"Juanita\", as he had nicknamed the mummy, in a box in his room, next to the TV. He added that it was owned by his father, without specifying how it had come into his father's possession.. Experts said the body was between 600 and 800 years old and that it was that of an adult male rather than a woman, as the man who was discovered with it had assumed. . The mummified male is estimated to have been more than 45 years old at the time of his death and 1.51m tall (4ft 11in).. The mummy was wrapped in bandages in the foetal position which is typical of many of the pre-Hispanic burials in the area.  . Mummification was practiced by a variety of cultures in what is now Peru before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. Some mummies were buried while others were brought out and paraded during key festivals. . Police have seized the mummy carried in the cooler bag and handed it to Peru's ministry of culture, which looks after the country's heritage. . The man who was transporting it and and his two friends, who are between 23 and 26 years old, were detained and are being investigated for possible crimes against Peru's cultural heritage.. ",

        "content": "It is the first public confirmation of the FBI's classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.. China has denied a lab leak in Wuhan, calling the allegation defamatory. . Mr Wray's comments come a day after the US ambassador to China called for the country to \"be more honest\" about Covid's origins.. In his interview on Tuesday, Mr Wray said China \"has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\" efforts to identify the source of the global pandemic. . \"And that's unfortunate for everybody,\" he said.. Some studies suggest the virus made the leap from animals to humans in Wuhan, China, possibly at the city's seafood and wildlife market.. The market is a 40-minute drive from a world-leading virus laboratory, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research into coronaviruses.. Other US government agencies have drawn differing conclusions to the FBI's, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings.. The Chinese government has not yet responded to Mr Wray's comments. However on Monday, it dismissed media reports that the US energy department had assessed with \"low confidence\" that Covid leaked from a lab. The agency had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began.. Beijing also alluded to a 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) investigation that called the lab leak theory \"extremely unlikely\".. \"Certain parties should stop rehashing the 'lab leak' narrative, stop smearing China and stop politicising origins-tracing,\" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.. The WHO. investigation was deeply criticised and its director-general has since called for a new inquiry, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\". On Monday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden supports \"a whole-of-government effort\" to discover how Covid began.. But he added that the US still lacks a clear consensus as to what happened.. \"We're just not there yet,\" he said. \"If we have something that is ready to be briefed to the American people and the Congress, we will do that.\". An unclassified report released by the US top spy official in October 2021 also said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus.. Chinese propagandists have also pushed a conspiracy theory suggesting that .  in Frederick, Maryland, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.. Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox. . Tensions in bilateral ties between the US and China have spiked in the wake of the recent spy balloon saga.. On Tuesday, a bipartisan panel of US lawmakers kicked off a series of hearings on the \"existential\" threat of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.. The first session of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party focused on issues such as human rights and the US economy's dependence on Chinese manufacturing.  .
