        "content": "Her alleged crime? Olesya was arrested for anti-war posts on social media. One of them concerned last October's explosion on the bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea.. \"I posted an Instagram story about the bridge,\" Olesya tells the BBC, \"reflecting on how Ukrainians were happy with what had happened.\" . She had also shared a friend's post about the war.. Then the drama began.. \"I was talking on the phone to my mother,\" Olesya recalls, \"when I heard the front door opening. Lots of police came in. They took away my phone and shouted at me to lie on the floor.\". Olesya was charged with justifying terrorism and discrediting the Russian armed forces. She faces up to 10 years in prison.. \"I never imagined anyone could get such a long prison sentence for posting something on the internet,\" Olesya says. \"I'd seen reports of crazy verdicts in Russia, but I hadn't paid much attention and continued to speak out.\". A student of the Northern Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Olesya has now been added to Russia's official list of terrorists and extremists. . \"When I realised I'd been put on the same list as school shooters and the Islamic State group I thought it was crazy,\" recalls Olesya. . Under the rules of her house arrest she's banned from talking on the phone and going online.. Olesya has a striking image tattooed on her right leg - Russian President Vladimir Putin depicted as a spider, with an Orwellian inscription: \"Big Brother is watching you.\". It appears that in Olesya's case, it wasn't Big Brother watching her, but her fellow students.. \"A friend showed me a post about me in a chat,\" Olesya says, \"about how I was against the 'special military operation'. Most of the people in this chat were history students. They were discussing whether to denounce me to the authorities.\". The BBC has seen extracts from the group chat.. In one comment, Olesya is accused of writing \"provocative posts of a defeatist and extremist character. This is out of place for war-time. It must be nipped in the bud\". . \"First let's try to discredit her. If she doesn't get it, let the security services deal with it.\". \"Denunciation is the duty of a patriot,\" someone else writes.. Later, when the list of prosecution witnesses was read out in court, Olesya recognised the names from the student chat.. It's one year since the Kremlin launched its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine - the term it uses for Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Within weeks of the assault, President Putin was calling on the Russian public to separate \"true patriots from scum and traitors\".. Since then, across Russia .  against critics of the war. They include students informing on teachers and workers denouncing colleagues. . Public criticism of the invasion - and that includes reposting other people's criticism - is dangerous. The Russian authorities expect total, unflinching support for the offensive in Ukraine. If you don't support it, at the very least you're expected to stay silent. If you don't stay silent, there's a string of repressive laws for punishing dissent. That includes laws against spreading \"false information\" about the military and \"discrediting\" the army.. In Arkhangelsk, a giant portrait of a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine stares down on the city from the side of a nine-storey apartment block, along with the words: \"Being a warrior means living forever.\" . The patriotic messaging is persuasive. On the streets of Arkhangelsk, we find little sympathy for Russians facing prosecution for their anti-war comments. . \"People who discredit our army or spread fakes, they're sick in the head,\" Konstantin tells me. \"They should be sent to the front line as cannon fodder.\" . \"I have a negative attitude to critics of the special operation,\" Ekaterina tells me. . But a long prison sentence for posting something online, isn't that harsh? I ask.. \"People should use their brains,\" Ekaterina replies. \"If they live in this country, if they enjoy all the benefits this country has to offer, if they're patriots, they need to abide by the law.\". Later that day Olesya is allowed out of her flat. But only to attend a court hearing. Her defence lawyers are trying to persuade a judge to lift the restrictions on her movement. . Olesya's T-shirt sports a picture of a police van with \"School Bus\" written on it. A comment on how young Russians are being punished for their criticism of the authorities.. The judge rules to keep her under house arrest.. \"The state doesn't have the stomach for debate, for democracy or freedom,\" Olesya says. \"But they can't put everyone in prison. At some point they'll run out of cells.\". ",

        "content": "Watch: Five things to know about Nikki Haley. \"Now is not the time to hold back. Now is the time for a strong and proud America,\" . , linking to a campaign video.. She is the second major Republican candidate to run - her ex-boss, Donald Trump, launched his bid in November.. Ms Haley is the third Indian American to seek a presidential nomination.. The former governor, 51, said in 2021 that she wouldn't challenge Mr Trump for the White House. But she changed her position in recent months, citing the need for \"generational change\".. Other Republicans who are tipped to launch their own White House campaigns include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Vice-President Mike Pence.. Ms Haley has previously criticised Mr Trump's behaviour up to and during the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters. . The day after the riot, she said in a speech that \"his actions since election day will be judged harshly by history\".. Most early polls show Mr Trump with a comfortable lead in South Carolina, whose primary he won on his way to the presidency in 2016 - an indication of the uphill battle the former ambassador will have, even on what should be friendly ground.. A recent survey by the polling firm Trafalgar Group that included current and likely candidates has Mr Trump in first place with 43% and Ms Haley in fourth at 12%.. But another opinion poll released on Tuesday suggested Mr Trump's once-resilient political strength could be softening among members of his party.. Forty per cent of registered Republicans said he should not run for the White House in 2024, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, even as he remained the favourite among the party's field of potential candidates.. The same poll found that 52% of registered Democrats do not support Mr Biden running for re-election.. Other Indian Americans to run before Ms Haley were Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, whose bid in 2015 never gained significant traction, and current Vice-President Kamala Harris, who sought the 2020 nomination..

        "content": "The anger here is growing, not least because many here have seen a building report from the health ministry's website. In red it says \"earthquake resistance test came back negative\".. It was released in 2012. It's not known what - if any - remedial work was done, but locals at the site are discussing it and sharing it with one another.. Alican Kenar's grandmother and her brother were in the hospital when it collapsed. His grandmother's body was only found on Tuesday evening, more than a week after the quake struck.. \"This is all the fault of a person or people, and the government, of course,\" Mr Kenar told us. \"It's obvious, everyone can see that. It's not destiny, this is fault.\". Other families still sit at the base of the site, covered in dust as the diggers sift through the material. . The families tell us they paid out of their own pockets for the machinery and fuel to find their missing. . Some say they have only seen volunteer search and rescue teams, rather than state-funded teams. Mr Kenar says he saw some officials in the first few days, but only a few in number and with no equipment. . \"This building was untouched for two to three days,\" Mr Kenar says. \"This reality is very disorganised. It could have been different had we been prepared. We should have learned lessons.\". While we are at the site, the Turkish official search and rescue team, AFAD arrived, but were met with anger.. \"We've been waiting here for 9 days,\" one woman shouted. The AFAD representatives left and had not returned by the time the BBC team left the site several hours later. . Recovery workers occasionally pause their work - once to pull out a handbag, and through the wallet to find any form of ID. . Then, there is a shout. They have found another body. He's identified by his hospital wrist band. A family runs forward with photos on their phones that the rescuers look at.. A nod. It is their father. His daughters scream \"papa, papa\", as his body is carried away in a black body bag. . This video can not be played. Before and after: Drone video shows earthquake ruins in Hatay, Turkey. ",
