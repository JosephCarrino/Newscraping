        "content": "Providing help can now fetch up to three years in prison in Poland.. The woman Ms Wydrzynska sent the pills to did not end up having an abortion.. UN officials, gynaecologists and human rights groups had all appealed for the case to be dropped.. Ms Wydrzynska, who will appeal against the verdict, told the court she had sent a package of abortion pills to the pregnant woman when she found out that she was in an abusive relationship.. The woman involved, named as Ania which is not her real name, had planned to travel to a clinic in Germany to terminate her pregnancy, but was unable to travel when a Covid-19 lockdown was imposed. She then sought help online.. Ms Wydrzynska, who works with Abortion Dream Team, said she had decided to send Ania the pills to give her a choice. She had herself suffered abuse from the father of her children and had kept her own abortion a secret. . When Ania's partner found out about the pills he confiscated them and reported the activist to police. She never had the baby but subsequently had a miscarriage, according to reports.. Addressing the court, Ms Wydrzynska said she was innocent and that the state had failed her, Ania and other women, Polish website Oko.press reported: \"I was driven by the desire to help, when no-one else wanted to or could help.\". Protesters gathered outside the court in Warsaw holding .  (I am Justyna) banners and Amnesty International condemned the sentence as a \"depressing low in the repression of reproductive rights in Poland\".. Since 2020, abortion in Poland has been allowed only in cases of rape or incest or when the pregnancy endangers the health of the mother. Only Malta has stricter abortion laws in the European Union and the decision led to widespread protests in Poland.. Activists and women's rights groups say the 2020 court ruling has had a chilling effect on doctors who now fear repercussions even when there are legal grounds for an abortion.. When a pregnant woman died in a Polish hospital in 2021, her family said the laws stopped doctors from intervening and the government had to update the guidelines. Izabela, 30, died of septic shock as doctors are alleged to have waited for her unborn baby to die.. Although Ms Wydrzynska's lawyer had called for an acquittal, prosecutors had sought a longer term of community service. Ultra-orthodox Catholic legal group group Ordo Iuris which took part in the trial said she should receive a suspended jail term.. The verdict is thought to be the first time an activist, rather than a family member or doctor, has been put on trial for helping someone have an abortion in Poland. . Last year, the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics (Figo) wrote to public prosecutor general Zbigniew Ziobro calling on him to drop the charges and halt further \"reprisals\" against Ms Wydrzynska or other activists and fully decriminalise access to abortion..

        "content": "They are being investigated on charges of rape, people trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Both have denied wrongdoing. . Mr Tate's spokeswoman said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that his legal team would appeal.. Lawyers for Mr Tate have long argued that keeping him in preventative custody is unnecessarily harsh, when other judicial options - such as house arrest - are available.. Judges have so far disagreed, based on the perceived risk of Mr Tate fleeing the country, influencing witnesses or evidence, or that his release would disturb public order.. The request for bail in place of custody was new, but the response from the court, the same.. In late February, the court ruled that Mr Tate should remain in custody until 29 March. . On Wednesday, Mr Tate's brother Tristan will also apply for bail in a separate hearing. . Last month, an appeals court overturned all but one of the justifications for keeping Tristan Tate in detention.. No charges have yet been brought against the brothers or the two Romanian associates who were arrested alongside them.. In 2016, Mr Tate, a former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.. He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. ",

Earlier on Tuesday police clashed with the ex-PM's supporters outside his residence in Lahore as they tried to detain him on a court order. . He is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated..

Officers fired tear gas shells to disperse supporters of Mr Khan, who threw stones and bricks. . The politician, 70, claimed there was \"no reason\" for police to arrest him on Tuesday as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts.. \"I'm mentally prepared that I'm going to be spending my night in a cell,\" he said on Tuesday. \"I don't know how many nights, but I'm all prepared for that.\". The former prime minister showed what he said were tear gas cannisters, which he said had been fired into his property. . He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders to arrest him over corruption cases. . She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.. Mr Khan's supporters are also holding protests in other cities.. He was ousted as prime minister last April but has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He blames Mr Sharif for .  in which he was wounded in the leg.. ",
