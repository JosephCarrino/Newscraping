        "content": "The taxpayer will not bear any losses from the move, the statement said.. SVB was .  who seized its assets on Friday.. It was the largest failure of a US bank since the financial crisis in 2008.. The move came as the firm, a key tech lender, was scrambling to raise money to plug a loss from the sale of assets affected by higher interest rates.. \"The US banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,\" the authorities' joint statement said.. \"Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe.\". Those actions also apply to Signature Bank of New York, seen as the most vulnerable institution after SVB, which came under regulatory control on Sunday.. As part of their moves to restore confidence, regulators also unveiled a new way to give banks access to emergency funds. . The Federal Reserve said it would offer assistance through a new Bank Term Funding Program, making it easier for banks to borrow from it in a crisis.. President Joe Biden said the American people could have \"confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them\".. SVB was seen as a crucial lender for early-stage businesses in the tech sector. It was the banking partner for nearly half of US venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets last year.. I've been speaking to people with money stuck in SVB over the weekend. . One founder told me had been constantly refreshing his online banking page, hoping it might work. . Another said he was confident the government would step in, but admitted he might have lost about around 40% of the company's cash overnight. . This statement, then, has been welcomed by depositors. But there are those that will raise eyebrows at this move. . SVB mainly banked start-ups and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley - the tech elite.  And those Silicon Valley elites tend to have more than a streak of libertarianism to their politics: the boilerplate view is that government is slow and too big. . Critics argue that it's with great irony that it's the government who has stepped in to save the day. Some will wonder whether influential tech bros have been given preferential treatment: capitalism for when things go well, socialism for when it doesn't. . It's why the statement is worded carefully that taxpayers will not be paying for this. Mr Biden will now have to defend the move - and reassure members of his own party that guaranteeing depositors was the only way. . SVB started as a California bank in 1983 and expanded rapidly over the last decade. . But it came under pressure as higher interest rates made it harder for start-ups to raise money through private fundraising or share sales.. In Silicon Valley, the reverberations from the collapse have been widespread as companies face questions about what it means for their finances.. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the US authorities had \"acted aggressively to prevent a contagion developing\".. \"Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks, which can happen in the blink of an eye in the digital age. But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work,\" he added.. Meanwhile, . . A consortium of investors led by the Bank of London, a UK clearing bank, has submitted a formal bid to the UK Treasury. . The British government has been working on a plan to support UK tech firms affected by the collapse of SVB.. ",

        "content": "WATCH: Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis make emotional speeches. Sunday's ceremony was an opportunity for Ke Huy Quan to catch up with his old friend Harrison Ford.. Quan, who starred alongside Ford in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was a child, won best supporting actor for Everything Everywhere All at Once following a two-decade break from performing.. After . , he excitedly ran up to the stage and embraced his former co-star, who presented the award.. Lada Gaga made sure her vocals were centre stage when she performed without make-up and wearing jeans and a plain T-shirt.. The look for her performance of Hold My Hand, nominated for best original song, was a stark contrast to her earlier appearance on the not-so-red carpet, in a black Versace dress with a sheer corset bodice.. British actor Hugh Grant's humour was a hit with the crowd at the Dolby Theatre.. When presenting the award for best production design with his Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star Andie MacDowell, Grant joked: \"The purpose of this is two-fold.. \"The first is to raise the vital importance of a good moisturiser. Andie has used one every day of her life, I have not.\" . Grant then gestured to MacDowell, saying: \"Still stunning.\" He then gestured to himself: \"Basically a scrotum.\". When presenting the In Memoriam tribute for Hollywood figures who have died last year, John Travolta offered an emotional tribute to his Grease co-star Olivia Newton John. . \"We remain hopelessly devoted to you,\" Travolta tearfully said, referencing the iconic song by Newton John.. The late-night talk show host returned to host his third Academy Awards ceremony. He quickly addressed last year's Oscars controversy, when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage. . \"We want you to have fun, feel safe and, most importantly, we want me feel safe. So, we have strict policies in place,\" Kimmel said.. \"If anyone in this theatre commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute long speech.. \"But seriously, the Academy has a crisis team in place,\" he added. \"If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the show, sit there and do absolutely nothing. Maybe even give the assailant a hug.\". In an ode to the Irish film Banshees of Inisherin, Kimmel later brought a donkey on stage. . \"She's a certified emotional support donkey. At least that's what we told the airline to get her on the plane from Ireland. If you're feeling sad or need a hug... Let's get you back on that Spirit Airlines flight now.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Kimmel kicks off Oscars with Will Smith joke, then brings out a donkey. Elizabeth Banks presented the award for best visual effects - accompanied by a very hyperactive grizzly.. \"I recently directed the film Cocaine Bear and without visual effects, this is what the bear would look like,\" Banks joked. .
