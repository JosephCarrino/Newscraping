        "content": "Both men have denied any wrongdoing. . Their detention had previously been upheld until 27 February, and has now been extended for another 30 days. . Two Romanian women being held with the brothers - Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu - will be released from custody and instead kept under house arrest. . Prosecutors applied for the latest extension earlier on Tuesday. Judges had justified the previous extension by citing the capacity of \"the defendants to exercise permanent psychological control over the victims\".. Last week BBC reported that the Tate brothers .  making rape and human trafficking claims against him. In a \"cease-and-desist\" letter sent by a US lawyer on their behalf, the pair threatened to sue the woman and her parents for $300m (£249m) if she did not retract her statements.. Speaking after today's extension application was filed, lawyers for the Tates told journalists that no new evidence was presented at the hearing, and that the prosecutors' case did not support the brothers' continued detention.. A legal adviser for the brothers told the BBC last week that they would challenge any decision to keep them in custody beyond next Monday. Asked how the brothers were responding to their continued detention, she replied that it was \"very challenging\".. Mr Tate, a former kickboxer, rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman. . He went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.. Despite social media bans he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.. ",

        "content": "The men had held a wedding ceremony in 2019, but same-sex marriage is not recognised in South Korea.. Activists say the ruling is a leap forward for LGBT rights in the country.. However, the case will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  . The plaintiff, So Seong-wook said he welcomed the ruling and \"recognition of a very obvious right that has not been given\".. In 2021, he sued the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) after being denied coverage on his partner Kim Yongmin's plan.. The couple had been granted coverage at first, but this was then revoked as the NHIS said they had made a mistake in granting it to the same-sex couple.. Celebrating the ruling, Mr So praised the court for seeing \"the principle of equality as an important issue\".. \"I think it has a great meaning for LGBTQ people who have been in a discriminatory situation, those who support them and all those who are discriminated against,\" he told the BBC.. The Seoul High Court overturned a lower court's verdict. It found spousal coverage under the NHIS extended to not just families as defined by law. . It also found that denying same-sex couples such benefits amounted to discrimination.. \"Everyone can be a minority in some way. To be in the minority is to be different from the majority and cannot be wrong itself,\" the court judgement read.. \"In a society dominated by the principle of majority rule, awareness of the rights of minorities and efforts to protect them are necessary.\". A Human Rights Watch report last year found that discrimination against LGBT people in South Korean society remained \"pervasive\". . Same-sex couples  - without the legal status of marriage - are often excluded from government benefits for newlyweds.. After Tuesday's court ruling, Amnesty International released a statement saying: \"There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTI community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome.\".

        "content": "The BBC goes undercover on Kenya’s tea plantations. Lawmaker Beatrice Kemei said she watched the report with \"utter shock\".. The BBC found more than 70 women had been abused by their managers at plantations operated by two British companies - Unilever and James Finlay. . The companies say they have suspended the three managers in question and are shocked by the allegations.. The Fairtrade Foundation described the allegations as \"appalling\", and said the investigation - by BBC Africa Eye and BBC Panaroma - were \"nothing less than a #MeToo moment for tea\".. Ms Kemei, who serves as woman representative for a tea-growing area in Kericho county, said the report highlighted the \"entrenched\" sexual harassment at \"tea multinationals operating in our country\".. MP Beatrice Elachi said it was unfortunate that such incidents were still taking place.. \"Today is a very difficult day for me as a woman, leader and citizen of Kenya. Today I've been reminded that slavery still exists in this nation; I cannot explain how a man has violated women in tea plantations for 30 years and nothing has been done,\" she was quoted by local media as saying.. Deputy Speaker Gladys Shollei ordered a committee of MPs to complete an investigation into the allegations within two weeks. . In the BBC investigation, one woman said she had been infected with HIV by her supervisor, after being pressured into having sex with him.. Another woman said a divisional manager stopped her job until she agreed to have sex with him.. \"It is just torture; he wants to sleep with you, then you get a job,\" she said.. A BBC undercover reporter, who posed as a jobseeker, was invited to a job interview by a recruiter for James Finlay & Co. . It turned out to be in a hotel room, where she was pinned against a window and asked to undress by the recruiter, who has worked on Finlay's plantations for more than 30 years, and had already been flagged as a \"predator\" by a number of women who spoke to the BBC.. \"I'll give you some money, then I'll give you a job. I have helped you, help me,\" he said.. \"We'll lie down, finish and go. Then you come and work.\". Unilever faced similar allegations more than 10 years ago and launched a \"zero tolerance\" approach to sexual harassment as well as a reporting system and other measures, but the BBC found evidence that allegations of sexual harassment were not being acted on.. The BBC's Tom Odula spoke to women who worked on tea farms run by both companies. A number told him that because work is so scarce, they are left with no choice but to give in to the sexual demands of their bosses or face having no income.. British supermarket chain Tesco said it takes the allegations \"extremely seriously\" and is in \"constant dialogue\" with Finlay's to ensure \"robust measures\" are taken.. In response to the BBC investigation, Sainsbury's, another supermarket chain, said: \"These horrific allegations have no place in our supply chain.\" . On Monday, it issued a revised, updated statement saying it will \"take robust action to safeguard workers\" in its \"tea supply chain.\". Starbucks also issued a statement on Monday, saying it was \"deeply concerned\" and has taken \"immediate action\" to suspend purchasing from James Finlay & Co in Kenya. . James Finlay & Co said it had suspended the manager, and had reported him to the police. It was investigating whether its Kenyan operation has \"an endemic issue with sexual violence\", the company added.. Unilever said it was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the allegations. The company sold its operation in Kenya while the BBC was secretly filming.. The new owner, Lipton Teas and Infusions, said it had suspended two managers, and had ordered a \"full and independent investigation\".. ",
