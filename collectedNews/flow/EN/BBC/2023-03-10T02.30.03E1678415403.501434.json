        "content": "Ministers also agreed on measures that would improve legal routes for foreign workers arriving in Italy.. The proposals came during a cabinet meeting near the site where 72 migrants died in a shipwreck last month.. Ms Meloni insisted she was determined to defeat human trafficking at the meeting in the Calabrian town of Cutro. . \"Our response to what happened is a policy of greater firmness on the ground,\" she said, adding that Italy would act against human traffickers on the boats and those in third countries who organised the trips. . The government has denied responsibility for the disaster, but Ms Meloni said that more improved and legal routes had to be opened up to allow migrants to safely reach the country. . \"I believe that another way to fight human traffickers is to send out the message that it does not pay to enter Italy illegally,\" she said.. Separately, she said countries who helped educate their citizens about the risks of using criminal networks to head to Italy would get preferential quotas for legal migrant workers.. Protesters threw cuddly bears at passing cars as the ministers were driven to the cabinet meeting in Cutro on Thursday. Some held up signs reading \"They could have been saved\".. Ms Meloni's right-wing government has faced criticism over the disaster in February, with questions raised over whether more could have been done to prevent it.. Most of those on the wooden vessel, thought to have carried 200 people, were said to be from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran.. The ship is thought to have sunk after it crashed against rocks in rough weather, while trying to land near Crotone.. Officials said said 72 bodies have been recovered and another 79 people survived, but around 30 are still missing. . ",

Violence has since decreased sharply, but pro-Taliban figures have been targeted by IS..

Muzammil had led the fight against IS in his previous posting as governor of the eastern province of Nangarhar. He was moved to Balkh last October.. Balkh police spokesperson Mohammed Asif Waziri said the explosion occurred on Thursday morning on the second floor of the governor's office. . \"There was a bang.

        "content": "There are fears the vessel could soon break apart or explode, risking one of the worst oil spills in recent memory.. But on Thursday, the UN said it had purchased a crude carrier that would head to Yemen and remove the oil from the stricken ship.. \"The purchase of this suitable vessel... marks the beginning of the operational phase of the plan to safely remove the oil and avoid the risk of an environmental and humanitarian disaster,\" Achim Steiner from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said, adding that it was a \"major breakthrough\"..  said the ship - which it purchased from major tanker company Euronav - was undergoing routine maintenance in China and would arrive for the operation in early May.. \"A major spill would devastate fishing communities on Yemen's Red Sea coast, likely wiping out 200,000 livelihoods instantly. Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions,\" it said.. The organisation added that a potential oil spill could cost up to $20bn (Â£16.7bn) to clean up.. The UN had been searching for years for a solution and appealed for donations. The planned operation is estimated to cost $129m of which $75m has been received and another $20m has been pledged, it said.. The stranded ship - the FSO Safer - was left abandoned off the port of Hodeida after Yemen's civil war broke out in 2015. It has not been serviced since.. It was constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and converted later into a floating storage for oil. It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.. The 376m (1,233ft) vessel holds an estimated 1.14m barrels of crude oil.. The Safer's structural integrity has deteriorated significantly since maintenance operations were suspended in 2015, when the Houthis seized large parts of Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government. The ensuing conflict has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left more than 23 million in need of aid.. Mr Steiner told reporters on Thursday: \"Let me be very clear - this is a risky operation and things could go wrong.\" He added that it could still be suspended if they fail to raise enough funds..

        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. Electricity is needed for cooling radioactive material present at the plant. . \"Today's loss of all external power once again demonstrated how fragile and dangerous the situation is for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,\" said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).. Earlier on Thursday he had called for an international commitment to protect the plant, following a series of strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Mr Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "A letter from the Scorpions Group was allegedly left with the men which apologised to the people of Matamoros, to the US victims and their families, and to a Mexican woman killed last week when the gang fired on a white minivan the Americans were travelling in. . The Associated Press says it has obtained a copy of the letter from a law enforcement official in the state of Tamaulipas. . \"We have decided to turn over those who were directly involved and responsible for the events\", the letter reads, saying the five had \"acted under their own decision-making and lack of discipline\". The letter also accuses the men of breaking the cartel's rules over \"protecting the lives of the innocent\".  . This video can not be played. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico. Meanwhile, a health clinic in Matamoros where the cartel members allegedly took the injured US citizens for treatment has been cordoned off by police. Reports suggest the four Americans were taken there by the gang but the two with the worst injuries - Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown - died soon after.  . Reuters news agency reported that Mexican officials had given the bodies of the two dead men to US officials in Matamoros on Thursday afternoon, and their remains were repatriated. . The latest developments come as some doubts have been cast in Mexico on the initial version of events. The group were said to have travelled to Matamoros for one of them, Latavia McGee, to undergo a cosmetic medical procedure at a clinic in the city. Her three friends were said to have accompanied her to the appointment.  . However, the Reuters news agency has reported that three of the four Americans had convictions for mainly minor drug-related offences - but one was charged with manufacturing banned narcotics with the intent to distribute.  . Reuters says it's seen an internal law enforcement document which shows the Mexican authorities are investigating the possibility the four Americans were kidnapped having been mistaken for rival cartel members encroaching on their turf. . The question over the Americans' backstory comes as the political temperature over the incident in Matamoros continues to rise. In the United States, several Republican politicians, among them the Senator for South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, have called for the use of US military force against Mexico's drug cartels. . Specifically, he's proposing a plan to designate Mexican drug cartels as \"Foreign Terrorist Organisations\" in order to, as he put it, \"unleash the fury and might of the United States against (them)\". . That rhetoric prompted a furious response in Mexico from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who said \"Mexico was not a protectorate or a colony of the United States\". His sentiments were echoed by the Foreign Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, who called Senator Graham's proposal for military intervention \"unacceptable\". . Amid the tense relations, the US Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall, is in Mexico for a meeting with President Lopez Obrador to discuss the worsening crisis over fentanyl and synthetic opioids in the US.  .
