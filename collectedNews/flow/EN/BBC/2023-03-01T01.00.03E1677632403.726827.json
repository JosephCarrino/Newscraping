        "content": "Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia.. Russian energy giant Gazprom operates a facility near the village of Gubastovo, about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, where the drone crashed.. Gazprom told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that its operations in the Kolomna district had not been interrupted.. The target of the drone in Kolomna \"was probably a civilian infrastructure facility, which was not damaged\", Mr Vorobyov posted on Telegram. . \"There are no casualties or damage on the ground. The FSB (Russian security service) and other competent authorities are investigating,\" he added.. Images shared by Russian media and officials show a damaged drone in a snow-covered field in front of a forest of birch trees. The area around the Gazprom facility is heavily forested.. The appearance of the drone matches that of the UJ-22 Airborne, a product of Ukrainian manufacturer Ukrjet.. Ukrjet says the vehicle has a range of 800km - enough for it to reach the Kolomna area from Ukraine.. A reverse image reveals no previous matches for the image, suggesting it is recent.. Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, tweeted a photo of the drone. . \"It is more than 500km away from Russian border with Ukraine. Soon Putin might get very afraid to show himself in public as drones can reach far distances,\" he wrote alongside the photo.. If Ukraine was behind the Kolomna drone, it would be the closest attempted drone attack to the capital since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.. It came as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had downed two Ukrainian drones in southern Russia.. The ministry accused Kyiv of attempting to use drones \"to attack civilian infrastructure in the Krasnodar region and the Adygea Republic\", adding that they were \"neutralised by electronic warfare units\".. Moscow has accused Ukraine of being behind attacks on Russian military infrastructure during the war, but Kyiv has not confirmed this. .  left three people dead, Moscow said. The Ukrainian military did not officially admit to the attack, but air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said the explosions were the result of what Russia was doing on Ukrainian soil.. Just weeks before, Russia accused Ukraine of a similar attack on the same airfield, which is home to bombers that have carried out missile attacks on Ukraine.. In August, a series of blasts rocked a military base in Crimea, in what was seen as a significant expansion of the conflict by Ukraine into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. . President Vladimir Putin told the FSB on Tuesday to intensify its activity against what he said was increasing espionage and sabotage by Ukraine and the West.. He instructed the FSB to strengthen security in territories occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine. He said units deployed at the border must stop sabotage groups and prevent the passage of illegal weapons and ammunition.   . \"We need to beef up our counterintelligence in general, because Western special services have traditionally been very active in relation to Russia,\" he said.. \"And now they have put in additional personnel, technical and other resources against us. We need to respond accordingly.\". Russia's defence ministry said its fighter jets were involved in a training exercise in the country's western airspace on Tuesday, hours after airspace over St Petersburg was closed due to reports of an unidentified object..

        "content": "Mr Tinubu, 70, a wealthy businessman and former governor of Lagos state, has 37% of votes counted so far.. Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has 29%, while third-party candidate Peter Obi has 24%.. The parties of both Mr Abubakar and Mr Obi have called for the election to be cancelled and rerun, alleging that the inability of the electoral commission to upload results to its website showed that the results had been manipulated.. Many voters reported problems with uploading results through the new electronic voting system, which was intended to speed up the process.. There were also widespread delays, with many polling stations opening several hours late, and some attacked by armed men. Voting was held overnight, and on Sunday in some areas.. The electoral commission says the opposition parties should take their complaints to court and is pressing ahead with the release of results.. A candidate needs to have the most votes nationwide and at least a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states, plus Abuja, to be declared the winner.. If those thresholds are not reached then there will a second round run-off between the top two candidates.. So far, Mr Tinubu has passed that threshold in 24 states.. President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after serving two terms, marked by economic stagnation and growing insecurity around the country - from an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, a nationwide crisis of kidnapping for ransom and separatist attacks in the south-east.. The election had been seen as a referendum on his time in office but Mr Tinubu seems to have managed to mobilise his supporters to vote.. Earlier on Tuesday, a group of angry protesters denounced the electoral commission, known as Inec, outside the national collation centre in the capital, Abuja.. \"Everything happening there is all lies, all lies, lies... they are cooking up results,\" one man told the BBC.. Another group held a counter-protest, urging the electoral commission to \"complete your job\" and calling on \"Nigerians to stand up for democracy\".. This video can not be played. Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos. European Union observers said the electoral body's poor planning and communication had undermined trust in the process.. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Mr Atiku's Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999.. Mr Obi ran for president for the first time, promising to challenge the two-party system. . He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates.. ",

But there has been opposition from opposition politicians, trade unions and religious figures.. At the start of the month, some 50,000 protesters gathered outside parliament in Copenhagen to protest the plan.. \"Stop the thief,\" Karsten Honge, a member of the Socialist People's Party, said during a parliamentary debate on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.. \"The government is ordering people to work one day more.\". However, there was not enough opposition in parliament to call a referendum. . Despite the opposition, Denmark's government coalition said the extra money was needed to raise the defence budget to Nato's target of 2% of GDP by 2030, instead of 2033 as previously planned. . This change of plan was due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the government said. . People in Denmark currently have up to 11 public holidays. . \"I don't think it's a problem to have to work an extra day,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in January.. ",

        "content": "Finland shares the longest European Union border with Russia, at 1,340km (832 miles). At present, Finland's borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences.. Finland decided to build the fence due to a rise in Russians seeking to escape conscription to fight in Ukraine.. The Nordic country also moved closer to joining the Nato alliance on Tuesday. Its parliament started debating a bill to speed up the country's bid, with a vote expected on Wednesday.. Work on the fence at the Imatra border crossing started on Tuesday with forest clearance, while road construction and fence installation are planned to start in March. . Night vision cameras, lights and loudspeakers will be installed in certain sections of the fence.. A 3km pilot project at Imatra is expected to be completed by the end of June, the Border Guard said. . Finland passed new amendments to its Border Guard Act in July to allow the building of stronger fences. The current wooden fences are mainly to prevent livestock crossing the border.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Finland has sought to strengthen its eastern border. In September, large numbers of Russians started fleeing to Finland after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilisation of reservists to fight in Ukraine.. Following Russia's invasion on 24 February last year, both Finland and Sweden decided they wanted to join Nato as soon as possible, after being neutral for years.. But Helsinki faces fewer diplomatic hurdles than Stockholm, and the Finnish government wants to move forward even before Finland's general elections in April. . Only Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve the Finnish and Swedish bids to join the defensive bloc.. ",

He added that it was owned by his father, without specifying how it had come into his father's possession.. Experts said the body was between 600 and 800 years old and that it was that of an adult male rather than a woman, as the man who was discovered with it had assumed. .

The mummy was wrapped in bandages in the foetal position which is typical of many of the pre-Hispanic burials in the area.  . Mummification was practiced by a variety of cultures in what is now Peru before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.

Police have seized the mummy carried in the cooler bag and handed it to Peru's ministry of culture, which looks after the country's heritage. .

The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for..

At least 12 children including a baby are among the victims.. Relatives of the victims living in northern Europe have arrived to try to get news of their relatives and identify bodies where necessary. .
