        "content": "Prosecutors have been looking at a possible indictment of Mr Trump. Reports say it could come next week.. If he is indicted, it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. This case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump's behalf by his lawyer to former porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.. It is one of several cases in which the 76-year-old is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted. . Past efforts to investigate him, including two impeachment trials, the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago raid, have tended to make him more popular with his base, so an indictment could have a similar effect.. It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged this week or even, beyond broad strokes, what those charges might be. . But with the former president predicting an arrest, and calling for mass protests, this is a journey into unknown territory.. Mr Trump has a loyal base of followers, and the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters following his repeated calls to protest has proven that a fraught situation can quickly escalate into violence.. On Saturday Mr Trump wrote on his social networking site Truth Social that \"illegal leaks\" from the Manhattan district attorney's office \"indicate\" he would be arrested on Tuesday. . The district attorney's office has not yet commented. Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said her team had not heard anything from law enforcement officials.. \"Since this is a political prosecution, the district attorney's office has engaged in a practice of leaking everything to the press, rather than communicating with President Trump's attorneys as would be done in a normal case,\" she said. . The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, has hit out at the investigation, calling it \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA [district attorney]\". . In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".. Any indictment would create a complicated calculation for Mr Trump's rivals within the Republican Party, as they decide whether to up their attacks on the former president while he is potentially distracted or keep their heads down and hope for the best. . If history is any guide, it will be the latter.. • . Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and ex-aides Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks, are among those understood to have given evidence so far. The Trump team has said the former president declined an invitation to appear, a sign the case is almost over, according to experts. Reports suggest one final witness could give evidence, possibly on Monday.. • . Once the investigation is complete, the grand jury votes on whether to recommend criminal charges. However, their verdict is not binding. Ultimately, it is up to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to determine what, if any, charges to bring. There is no deadline for this. It is a legal decision - what does he believe can he prove beyond a reasonable doubt to win a conviction - but also a deeply political one.. • . A former US president has never been indicted before but Mr Trump's lawyer said he would follow normal procedure. Typically, a defendant is either arrested or surrenders to the authorities - if they are facing a more serious felony charge they would be handcuffed. They then have their photo and fingerprints taken. After an initial hearing - called an arraignment - a defendant in a white-collar crime case like this is usually released until the next court date.. The Stormy Daniels case is about how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid Ms Daniels $130,000. The record for the payment reimbursing Cohen says the payment was for \"legal fees\". Prosecutors may say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, a misdemeanour in New York.  . US media organisations say law enforcement agencies in New York are preparing for the possibility of Mr Trump being indicted and appearing in a Manhattan courtroom as early as next week.. According to the Associated Press, they are considering the practicalities of taking a former president into court, including questions around security. . Donald Trump faces a separate criminal investigation over efforts to overturn his narrow loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election - though it is not known if the former president is being directly investigated. . The Department of Justice is also looking at whether classified government documents were handled incorrectly after Mr Trump left office, as well as broader efforts to undermine the results of the presidential election three years ago - including the 6 January attack..

        "content": "For Maria Silvia and Francesca - and their four children Margherita, twins Giorgio and Raffaele, and Antonio - being finally recognised as a household after years of legal challenges and discrimination was \"truly incredible\".. This week, however, what was then seen as a major victory for equality and acceptance by the LGBT community was reversed.. Italy's right-wing government instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents, reigniting a debate around Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative agenda.. Families, activists and political opponents are to protest against the ban in Milan on Saturday.. Ms Meloni, who leads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, made anti-LGBT rhetoric a cornerstone of her electoral campaign, promising to protect traditional values. . \"We were always a family, but being officially recognised as such by our own mayor made us feel welcome,\" said Maria Silvia Fiengo. \"Today, looking at what the government is doing, and knowing that other families won't be able to have the same opportunity, we feel discouraged.\" . Italy legalised same-sex civil unions in 2016 under a centre-left government.. However, stiff resistance from Catholic and conservative groups meant that the law stopped short of granting adoption rights to same-sex couples as well. Opponents said it would encourage surrogate pregnancies, which are still illegal in Italy. . That left a regulatory vacuum surrounding several aspects of LGBT family life, including adoption. Solutions aimed at getting around bureaucratic hurdles were reached on a case-by-case basis, as cases went to court.. Some local administrators, including the centre-left mayor of Milan, decided that children of same-sex couples would be registered independently.  . Mr Sala has now announced he has been forced to halt the practice after he was sent a letter by the interior ministry. It cited a ruling by Italy's highest court requiring court approval for legal recognition of parental status. . \"It is a clear step backwards, politically and socially, and I put myself in the shoes of those parents who thought they could count on this possibility in Milan,\" said the mayor in his daily podcast Buongiorno Milano, adding that he was left with no other choice.. Children who are denied the right to have both parents recognised on their birth certificate are left in a legal limbo.. Their families face a range of challenges. In the most extreme scenario, if the legally recognised parent were to pass away, the children could become wards of the state and face the prospect of being orphaned. . In Italy's LGBT community, this has led to a growing sense of frustration and anxiety, while the Meloni government's hostile approach to LGBT rights has further exacerbated the issue.. \"Children end up having limited access to key services and benefits, such as healthcare, inheritance and child support,\" said Angelo Schillaci, law professor at Sapienza University in Rome. . \"At present, only one parent is recognised by law, the other one is a ghost. In real life, parents and children play together, cook together, play sports and go on holiday together. But on paper, they are apart, the state does not see them. It's a paradoxical situation.\" . The prime minister, elected last September, has been a vocal supporter of traditional family and Christian values, campaigning against what she calls \"gender ideology\" and the \"LGBT lobby\". Months before she came to power, she proposed a law that would make surrogacy by an Italian citizen a universal crime, and it is still on her party's agenda. . \"Boys and girls with two mothers and two fathers already exist in Italy, Prime Minister Meloni should get over it,\" said Alessia Crocini, president of the Rainbow Families association. \"We must guarantee our children the same rights as their peers.\" . \"We feel under attack,\" said Angela Diomede, who will take part in the Milan rally with her wife and their six-year-old girl. \"I don't understand this obsession of the government with targeting children, it doesn't lead anywhere.\" . Italy's Senate this week also rejected a proposal for a standardised European parenthood certificate that would be recognised across all 27 member states of the EU.. For children, it would mean proof of parenthood and for parents it would be a guaranteed right to be recognised across the EU, protecting rights such as inheritance and citizenship. . But for Italy's far-right infrastructure minister, Matteo Salvini, it was a step too far. \"A person can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual: love is free, beautiful and sacred for all,\" he tweeted.. Riccardo Magi, an opposition MP in favour of the Europe-wide certificate, complained: \"The world goes one way, the [Italian] government goes the other.\" . The debate is being followed closely from the north-eastern city of Udine by Stefano Zucchini and his husband Alberto.. They have two six-year-old twins, who were born in California through surrogacy, and hope to be legally recognised as a family one day. In the US, they are both recognised as parents. But in Italy, Stefano is listed as a single father, and that legal status makes life complicated.. \"Even things that are normal for most people, such as driving the kids to the kindergarten or to a doctor appointment, can become a challenge,\" he told the BBC.. \"They don't see us, but our love is as strong as ever. That, for sure, exists.\". ",

        "content": "The claims focus on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow's invasion in 2022.. Moscow has denied the allegations and denounced the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move, as the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects without the co-operation of a country's government. . Russia is not an ICC member country, meaning the court, located in The Hague, has no authority there. . However, it could affect Mr Putin in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally. He could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states. . Mr Putin is only the third president to be issued with an ICC arrest warrant.. President Biden said that, while the court also held no sway in the US, the issuing of the warrant \"makes a very strong point\".. \"He's clearly committed war crimes,\" he told reporters.. His administration had earlier \".  during the conflict in Ukraine, with Vice-President Kamala Harris saying in February that those involved would \"be held to account\". .  earlier this week that found Moscow's forced removal of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounted to a war crime. . In a statement on Friday, the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said the warrants were \"based upon forensic evidence, scrutiny and what's been said by those two individuals\".. The court had initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public to try and stop further crimes being committed.. \"Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported,\" Mr Khan told the BBC. . \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be a human being to know how egregious it is.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. Mr Khan also pointed out that nobody thought that Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, would end up in The Hague to face justice. . \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" Mr Khan said.. Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, who led the prosecution in the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said the warrant would change how foreign leaders view Mr Putin.  . \"He will remain an alleged criminal until and unless he submits himself for trial, or is handed over for trial and acquitted. That seems extremely unlikely, so he will remain an alleged criminal until the end of his life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. Russian opposition activists have welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his thanks to Mr Khan and the ICC for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. ",

        "content": "Russia has warned it will not allow the deal to go on longer unless sanctions against Moscow are softened.. The UN and Turkey helped broker the export agreement last July following fears of a global food crisis. . Ukraine is one of the world's top producers of grain, but its access to ports in the Black Sea was blocked by Russian warships following the invasion in February last year.. Countries that suffer with food insecurity, such as Yemen, rely heavily on these supplies. . Turkish President Recep Tayyup Erdogan announced an agreement on extending the deal on Saturday, with hours to go before it was due to expire.. \"This deal is of vital importance for the global food supply. I thank Russia and Ukraine, who didn't spare their efforts for a new extension, as well as the United Nations secretary general,\" he said.. But neither Mr Erdogan nor the UN clarified how long it would last. Ukraine wanted it to be extended for 120 days, but Russia said it was only willing to renew the pact for another 60 days.. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the UN, said on Friday that the EU, UK and US had two months to remove any sanctions targeting Russia's agricultural sector if they wanted the deal to continue.. Moscow wants Russian producers to be able to export more food and fertiliser to the rest of the world, but says Western sanctions are preventing them.. While food and fertiliser exports have not been targeted, Russia says restrictions on payments, insurers and shippers makes exports difficult.. Russia briefly withdrew from the deal in November last year, accusing Ukraine of attacking its fleet in the Crimea - but it re-joined a few days later.. , the deal has already allowed nearly 25 million tonnes of foodstuffs from Ukraine's Black Sea ports reach global markets..
