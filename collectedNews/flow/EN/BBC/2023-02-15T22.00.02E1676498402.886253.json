        "content": "An image of the new Barney, who will soon appear on \"television, film, and YouTube\", showed his fresh look.. But as one person responded: \"Thank you, Mattel for giving me nightmares with this horrifying-looking Barney.\". The popular Barney & Friends ran on PBS from 1992 until 2010, and the new series will premiere next year. . Previously, the purple dinosaur was played by an actor in a costume, but this reboot will be animated. . While the original Barney had been a polarising figure - from beloved to reviled - the character was everywhere, even appearing multiple times as a giant inflatable in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. . But the new glimpse of the character has sent social media spiralling, with many people longing for the version of Barney from their childhood. . One person quipped on Twitter that the new Barney had received an eyebrow lift and \"Dino-plasty\".. \"Trash, what a downgrade and that's why the OG will always be the best,\" another said. . Not all people were sceptical, however. \"I actually love the character design - looks fun!\" one person wrote.. While this might be seen as the most drastic change to Barney's iconic appearance, the character has gone through adjustments here and there throughout the years. . In the late-1980s series Barney and the Backyard Gang, Barney was actually a darker purple.. In addition to the series, Mattel says there will also be a \"full range of kids' products including toys, books, clothing, and more\".. Mattel's head of consumer products, Josh Silverman, said: \"We will tap into the nostalgia of the generations who grew up with Barney, now parents themselves, and introduce the iconic purple dinosaur to a new generation of kids and families around the world across content, products, and experiences.\".

        "content": "A large majority of MPs voted for the legislation, saying those affected had betrayed the Israeli state.. Critics say it is racist and violates international law by rendering people stateless.. The monthly stipends offered by the PA to Palestinian prisoners who have carried out attacks on Israelis, or their families, have long been highly contentious.  . Israel describes them as a \"pay for slay\" policy which encourages violence.. It already acts to freeze the bank accounts or seize assets of those who hold Israeli citizenship or Jerusalem residency rights whom it suspects of taking the financial support .  . Many Palestinians see the prisoners in Israeli jails as heroes of their nationalist struggle and the PA considers the payments made to them as social welfare.. In parliament, it was suggested the new legislation would affect hundreds of prisoners.. They could ultimately be deported to PA-controlled parts of the occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip.. After months of rising deadly violence - with Israeli raids against militants in the West Bank and Palestinian street attacks on Israelis - there was wide backing for the law in the Israeli parliament.. At a time of deep political division, it was passed by 94 votes to 10, with members of the hard-right governing coalition and opposition parties voting in favour.. Israeli member of parliament Ofir Katz, from the prime minister's Likud party, who headed the joint committee that prepared the proposal, suggested it would bring comfort to bereaved families.  . \"I hope that this step we are taking today is the dawn of a new era. I know and feel from the bottom of my heart that such laws are our true mission as elected officials,\" he said.. \"I say unequivocally, a terrorist who receives money from the Palestinian Authority, should fly from here to Gaza, anywhere else.\". The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the law as \"the ugliest form of racism.\". Opposition lawmakers who objected to the bill said it was discriminatory because it would not apply to Jewish Israelis convicted of attacks against Palestinians or other serious offences.. \"For example, Yigal Amir murdered a prime minister - not only was his citizenship not revoked, there was no proposal,\" said Ahmed Tibi, referring to the Israeli Jewish extremist who assassinated the former prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin.. About a fifth of Israelis are Arab citizens who often identify as and with Palestinians.. Most Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed in a move not recognised internationally, have the status of permanent residents.. ",

        "content": "Widely remembered for playing a bikini-clad cavewoman in the 1966 film One Million Years BC, Welch also won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in 1974's The Three Musketeers.. She is often credited as a prototype for action heroines in Hollywood.. Born Jo Raquel Tejada in 1940, Welch grew up in California, where she won teen beauty pageants and later became a local weather forecaster.. During a brief stint in Dallas, Texas, the divorced mother of two modelled for the Neiman Marcus clothing store and worked as a cocktail waitress.. Her big break came in 1964 soon after she moved back to California, when she scored cameos in A House Is Not A Home, and Roustabout, a musical starring Elvis Presley.. But she shot to prominence two years later, with her back-to-back roles in the sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage and the fantasy film One Million Years BC.. Welch only had a few lines in the latter, but promotional stills of her wearing a skimpy two-piece deer-skin bikini turned her into a leading pin-up girl of the era.. Despite her public image, she long expressed discomfort with the representation of her body, once saying she \"was not brought up to be a sex symbol, nor is it in my nature to be one\".. \"The fact that I became one is probably the loveliest, most glamorous and fortunate misunderstanding,\" she added.. Welch went on to address her image in her memoir, Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage, in which she opened up about her childhood, her early career woes as a single mother in Hollywood, and why she would never lie about her age. . She leaves behind a son, Damon Welch, and daughter Tahnee Welch.. ",

        "content": "Their rescue came as workers turned their attention to cleaning up cities devastated by February's earthquakes.. Millions of people across Syria and Turkey are living in makeshift camps and require humanitarian aid. . Video of the rescue posted to social media by the Mayor of Darica, Muzaffer Biyik, showed workers applauding and embracing one another as Ms Kekec was loaded into the ambulance.. Local media reported that when they found the 42-year-old survivor, Ms Imamoglu, they told her she was \"awesome\".. In Antakya- another Turkish city badly affected by the earthquakes - local media reported that a mother and her two children were pulled alive from the rubble.. Ten days on from the disaster, it is becoming harder to find quake survivors. The combined death toll has now passed 41,000.. Foreign rescue workers who arrived in Turkey shortly after the quakes are beginning to pack up and return home, while locals are shifting their focus to cleaning up the debris.. Survivors must now begin to rebuild their lives. The Turkish government has encouraged people to return to their homes if possible, after authorities have declared they are safe. . But many have lost their homes and are living in makeshift camps. In Kahramanmaras, where the women were rescued, more than 1,000 survivors camped in a local stadium. . In Syria, relief efforts have been hampered by the civil war that has divided the country.. The UN did not provide aid to Syria for days, saying logistical issues were to blame.. When aid did arrive following the opening of a second border crossing through Turkey, rescuers said they did not supply any of the heavy machinery required to remove rubble. . \"It has never happened before, that there was an earthquake somewhere and the international community and the UN don't help,\" said Raed Saleh, who is leading the White Helmets rescue force in opposition-held areas..
