        "content": "Kyiv strongly denied the Russian claim.. The alleged incident has not been independently verified.. Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, .  that it was \"a classic deliberate provocation\". \"RF [Russia] wants to scare its people to justify the attack on another country,\" he said. . Russia has previously reported some Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on Russian border areas, including Bryansk region. But there have been no confirmed reports of Ukrainian ground forces infiltrating Russia.. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"steps to destroy these terrorists are being taken\". Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said FSB forces and regular troops were battling \"Ukrainian nationalists\" who had crossed into Russia.. Speaking on Russian state TV, President Putin said \"today they committed another terrorist act, another crime, penetrated the border area and opened fire on civilians\".. \"They saw that it was a civilian car, that civilians and children were sitting there, and opened fire. It is exactly such people who set themselves the task of depriving us of historical memory. They will achieve nothing, we will put the squeeze on them,\" he said.. A video has appeared online claiming to show members of the Ukraine-based Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) outside a local clinic. One armed man in the video, . , says they crossed into Russia. . The investigative journalism group Bellingcat Monitoring describes the RVC as \"a unit officially formed last year made up primarily of anti-Putin, anti-Kremlin Russian far-right figures active in Ukraine\".. Commenting on the RVC claim, a Ukrainian military intelligence official, Andriy Yusov, said \"these are people who are fighting with arms against the Putin regime and those who support him... Perhaps Russians are beginning to wake up, realise something and take some concrete steps\".. ",

        "content": "\"She was thanking God that she was nearly there,\" Saadia tells us over the phone from her home in Quetta, in south-west Pakistan. \"She said she was scared that something could have happened while she was travelling across the water. She told us she couldn't believe it, that she would call her son and bring him for treatment when she arrived.\". Then the call dropped. They couldn't reach her again. . Shahida was 27 years old when she died in the shipwreck off the coast of Italy. Passengers on board came from Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran all trying to cross illegally to Europe. The wooden boat was thought to be carrying around 200 people; over 60 are known to have died. . Shahida had a very particular reason for making the dangerous journey, her family tells us. . \"The one and only reason for her to take this trip was for her three-year-old son,\" Saadia tells us. \"He is very unwell, part of his brain was damaged when he had a stroke at 40 days old because of a fever. It left his brain partially damaged and one side of his body from is head to his feet is paralysed.\". Despite taking her son to different hospitals in Karachi, they could offer no treatment, Saadia says. Instead, they suggested Shahida take her son abroad in the hope that they might be able to offer him some treatment there. Shahida had been growing increasingly desperate. . \"She said I can't see my son like this, I want him to walk like normal children, that's my only wish. She didn't want to see her son lying down helplessly,\" Saadia says. . \"She used to make us all laugh, but used to cry herself because of her son. Whenever she used to look at him, her eyes filled with tears.\". A professional hockey player for Pakistan's national team and domestic football player, Shahida's family say she wasn't very well paid, despite traveling internationally to play, including to Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Iran. . Her family say they didn't know about the planned trip or whether Shahida tried to get a visa to legally travel to settle in Italy, but human traffickers often convince those they take that they are able to get them settled abroad faster and more easily than any legal routes. Shahida was able to travel to Turkey legally on a visa before taking the ship. . She lived in Balochistan, a sparsely populated and impoverished province of Pakistan and was part of the Hazara, a minority Shia community, that are often targeted by extremist groups. Her family have said that this was not a factor in her wanting to leave Pakistan. . Just a few days before the ship wreck, other Pakistanis were killed when a ship wrecked of the Libyan coast also trying to reach Italy. . \"People leave out of desperation, they have no choice,\" Saadia says. \"Our government isn't helping its people, you can see how inflation and the cost of living is here.\"  . After a long wait, Shahida's family learnt about the wreck online. They say they haven't spoken to anyone from the government since the news broke. . \"It's like doomsday for our family,\" Saadia says. She starts to cry and stops our conversation to compose herself. Family friends have been visiting for the last few days to mourn. Local media is gathering outside the family house. \"The day we heard that she is no more, it is only us and our God that know how we feel.. \"We want the government to hand over her body as soon as possible. We don't need anything from anyone else now.\" . ",

        "content": "The two met briefly on the sidelines of the G20 summit in India, Mr Blinken said.. He also raised the case of Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia.. In the brief meeting, Mr Blinken urged Russia to rejoin the New START nuclear arms control treaty, calling its recent withdrawal an \"irresponsible decision\". . A senior State Department official said the discussion in Delhi lasted less than 10 minutes.. The official told reporters that Mr Blinken had \"disabused\" Mr Lavrov of any idea that US support for Ukraine is wavering. . Neither the official nor Mr Blinken commented on how Mr Lavrov responded. The official, however, said that there was no indication that Russia will change course in the near term.. The Russian foreign ministry said Mr Blinken had asked to speak to Mr Lavrov but did not comment on the conversation.. The last time the two met was in Geneva in January 2022. . Both Mr Lavrov and Mr Blinken commented on the war in Ukraine earlier during the Delhi summit. . On Thursday, Mr Lavrov accused Western countries of trying to influence neutral states to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. . \"The West continues its attempts to push everyone and everything,\" he said.. Mr Blinken reportedly held talks with top diplomats during the Delhi summit to rally support for Ukraine. In a closed-door group meeting on Thursday morning, Mr Blinken reemphasised his condemnation of the war.. \"We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability,\" he said, according to a text of his remarks released to reporters by the US State Department. . \"Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine,\" he added.. Mr Blinken repeated his condemnation to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva later in the day, where he appeared via video conference.. At a news conference on Thursday in Delhi, Mr Blinken said Russia should \"engage in meaningful diplomacy that can produce a just and durable peace\". He added, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has demonstrated zero interest in engaging\".. The G20, which includes the world's 19 wealthiest nations plus the European Union, accounts for 85% of global economic output and two-thirds of its population.. ",
