        "content": "Watch: \"I apologise to the whole Ukrainian nation\" - former Russian army officer. Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector.. At one site in southern Ukraine, he said \"the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week\". . \"Every day, at night, sometimes twice a day.\". Mr Yefremov tried to resign from the army numerous times - but he ended up being dismissed for refusing to return to Ukraine. He has now fled Russia.. Using photographs and military documents supplied by Mr Yefremov, the BBC has verified he was in Ukraine early in the war - in the Zaporizhzhia region, including the city of Melitopol.. Konstantin Yefremov's face flickers into view on my computer screen and we start to talk. He is a man with a story to tell. Until recently he was a Russian army officer. . Deployed to Ukraine last year, the former senior lieutenant has agreed to tell me about the crimes he says he witnessed there - including torture and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners. He will talk about his comrades looting occupied areas of Ukraine, and describe brutal interrogation sessions, led by a Russian colonel, in which men were shot and threatened with rape.. On 10 February 2022, Mr Yefremov says he arrived in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia nine years ago. He was the head of a de-mining unit of the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division - and was usually based in Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus. He and his men were sent to take part in \"military exercises\", he says. . \"At the time no-one believed there would be war. Everyone thought this was only a drill. I'm sure even senior officers didn't know.\". Mr Yefremov recalls seeing Russian troops taping identification marks on their uniforms and painting the letter \"Z\" on military equipment and vehicles. Within days, \"Z\" had become the symbol of what the Kremlin was calling its \"special military operation\". . Mr Yefremov claims he wanted nothing to do with it.   . \"I decided to quit. I went to my commander and explained my position. He took me to a senior officer who called me a traitor and a coward.. \"I left my gun, got in a taxi and drove off. I wanted to return to my base in Chechnya and resign officially. Then my comrades telephoned me with a warning. . \"A colonel had promised to put me in prison for up to 10 years for desertion and he'd alerted the police.\". Mr Yefremov says he called a military lawyer, who advised him to turn around. . \"I realise now I should have ignored that and driven on,\" he says. \"But I was afraid of being put in jail.\" . He went back to join his men.. Mr Yefremov insists he is \"anti-war\". He assures me he did not participate in Russia's annexation of Crimea, or fight in eastern Ukraine when war first erupted in the Donbas nine years ago. . In 2014, Russia was not only accused of orchestrating a separatist uprising there, but of sending in its own troops. Konstantin also tells me he has not taken part in Russia's military operation in Syria. . \"For the last three years I had been involved in mine clearance in Chechnya, a place that had experienced two wars. I think the work I've done there has benefited people.\". Mr Yefremov was placed in temporary charge of a rifle platoon. On 27 February, three days after the Russian invasion, he says he and his men were ordered to move north from occupied Crimea. They headed for the city of Melitopol.. The next 10 days were spent at an airfield which had already been captured by Russian troops. He describes the looting he witnessed.. \"Soldiers and officers grabbed everything they could. They climbed all over the planes and went through all the buildings. One soldier took away a lawnmower. He said proudly, 'I'll take this home and cut the grass next to our barracks.' . \"Buckets, axes, bicycles, they bunged it all in their trucks. So much stuff they had to squat down to fit in the vehicles.\". Mr Yefremov has sent us photographs he says he took at Melitopol air base. They show transport planes and a building on fire. . They are among a number of pictures and documents he has shared - and which we have verified - to confirm Mr Yefremov's identity, rank and his movements in Ukraine in the spring of 2022. . Online mapping tools confirmed the images of Melitopol air base.. For a month and a half, he and eight soldiers under his command guarded a Russian artillery unit there.. \"The whole time we slept outside,\" he recalls. \"We were so hungry we started hunting for rabbits and pheasants. One time we came across a mansion. There was a Russian fighter inside. 'We're with the 100th Brigade and we live here now,' the soldier said. . \"There was so much food. The fridges were packed. There was enough food to survive a nuclear war. But the soldiers living there were catching the Japanese carp in the pond outside and eating them.\". Konstantin Yefremov's group moved to guard what he describes as a \"logistics headquarters\" in April - in the town of Bilmak, to the north-east of Melitopol. There, he says he witnessed interrogations and mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners.. He recalls a day when three prisoners were brought in.. \"One of them admitted to being a sniper. On hearing this, the Russian colonel lost his mind. He hit him, he pulled the Ukrainian's trousers down and asked if he was married. . \"'Yes,' the prisoner replied. 'Then someone bring me a mop,' said the colonel. 'We'll turn you into a girl and send your wife the video.'\". Another time, says Mr Yefremov, the colonel asked the prisoner to name all the Ukrainian nationalists in his unit.. \"The Ukrainian didn't understand the question. He replied that the soldiers were naval infantry of the Ukrainian armed forces. For that answer they knocked out some of his teeth.\". The Kremlin wants Russians to believe that, in Ukraine, Russia is fighting fascists, neo-Nazis and ultra-nationalists. This false narrative serves to dehumanise Ukrainians in the eyes of the Russian public and the military.. Mr Yefremov says the Ukrainian prisoner had a blindfold on. . \"The colonel put a pistol to the prisoner's forehead and said 'I'm going to count to three and then shoot you in the head.' . \"He counted and then fired just to the side of his head, on both sides. The colonel started shouting at him. I said: 'Comrade colonel! He can't hear you, you've deafened him!'\". Mr Yefremov describes how the colonel gave orders that the Ukrainians shouldn't be given normal food - only water and crackers. But he says: \"We tried to give them hot tea and cigarettes.\" . So that the prisoners didn't sleep on bare ground, Mr Yefremov also recalls how his men tossed them hay - \"at night, so that no-one saw us\". . During another interrogation, Mr Yefremov says the colonel shot a prisoner in the arm - and in the right leg under the knee, which hit the bone. Konstantin says his men bandaged the prisoner up and went to the Russian commanders - \"not to the Colonel, he was crazy\" - and said the prisoner needed to go to hospital, otherwise he would die from blood loss.. \"We dressed him up in a Russian uniform and took him to hospital. We told him: 'Don't say you're a Ukrainian prisoner of war, because either the doctors will refuse to treat you, or the injured Russian soldiers will hear and shoot you and we won't be able to stop them.\". The UN's Human Rights Office has been documenting cases of mistreatment of prisoners in the war in Ukraine. It has interviewed more than 400 POWs - both Ukrainians and Russians. . \"Unfortunately, we've found there is torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war happening on both sides,\" says Matilda Bogner, head of the UN's Ukraine-based monitoring team. . \"If we compare the violations, the torture or ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war tends to happen at almost every stage of confinement. And, for the most part, the conditions of internment are worse in many areas of Russia or occupied Ukraine.\". The worst forms of torture or ill treatment for Ukrainian prisoners of war usually occur during interrogation, says Ms Bogner. They can be subjected to electrocution and a whole range of torture methods - she says - including hanging people up and beating them. . \"When they arrive at places of internment there are often so-called welcoming beatings. They also often face inadequate food and water,\" she adds.. Russian prisoners of war, too, have reported beatings and suffering electrocution.. \"Any form of torture or ill treatment is prohibited under international law,\" says Ms Bogner. \"It is unacceptable for either side to do this.\". The BBC was unable to independently confirm Konstantin Yefremov's specific allegations of torture, but they are consistent with other claims of abuse of Ukrainian prisoners.. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.. Mr Yefremov would eventually return to his de-mining unit, but not for long.. \"Seven of us had taken the decision [to leave the army],\" he tells me.. At the end of May, back in Chechnya, he wrote his letter of resignation. Some senior officers were not happy. . \"They started threatening me. Officers who hadn't spent a day in Ukraine were telling me that I was a coward and a traitor. They wouldn't allow me to resign. I was dismissed.\". Mr Yefremov shows us letters from the military.. In the first document, he is accused of \"shirking his duties\" and disregarding an order to return to Ukraine. It is described as \"a serious breach of discipline\".. The second letter refers to Mr Yefremov's \"early dismissal from military service… for breaking his contract\".. \"After 10 years of service I was denounced as a traitor, a defector, just because I didn't want to kill people,\" he says. \"But I was glad that I was now a free person, that I wouldn't have to kill or be killed.\" . Mr Yefremov was out of the army. But not out of danger of being sent back to the war.. In September 2022, President Putin declared what he called \"partial mobilisation\". Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens would be drafted into the military and sent to Ukraine.. Mr Yefremov says he knew - because he had already served with the military in Ukraine - he would not be left alone. He came up with an escape plan.. \"In the house where I was living I made a hatch in the attic ceiling… in case police and enlistment officers broke in to deliver call-up papers. . \"Enlistment officers were driving to my house and waiting for me in their cars. So, I rented a flat and hid there. . \"I hid from the neighbours, too, because I'd heard of cases when neighbours told police about young men who'd been drafted and were hiding. I found this situation humiliating and unacceptable.\"  . Mr Yefremov contacted Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, which helped him leave Russia.  . What does Mr Yefremov think about those Russians - and there are many - who express support for Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine?. \"I don't know what's going on in their heads,\" he says. \"How could they allow themselves to be fooled? When they go to market, they know they could be short-changed. They don't trust their wives, their husbands. . \"But the man who has been deceiving them for 20 years, he only has to give the word and these people are ready to go and kill and die. I can't understand it.\". As we end our chat, Mr Yefremov says sorry to the people of Ukraine.. \"I apologise to the entire Ukrainian nation for coming to their home as an uninvited guest with a weapon in my hands.. \"Thank God I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't kill anyone. Thank God I wasn't killed. . \"I don't even have the moral right to ask for forgiveness from the Ukrainians. I can't forgive myself, so I can't expect them to forgive me.\". ",

        "content": "The US College Board released the official syllabus on Wednesday removing some of the disputed subject matter. . The National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organisation, called the revisions \"disturbing\". . The administration of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - a Republican hotly tipped for the 2024 White House race - announced last month that the draft version of the new Advanced Placement (AP) course would not be taught in the state's high schools. . Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr called the syllabus \"woke indoctrination masquerading as education\".. He .  listing the state's objections to the class, arguing that it violated state law and was filled with critical race theory, a teaching that racism permeates US institutions.. AP courses give students the chance to take college-level courses before graduation. . They are overseen by the US College Board, and the African-American history syllabus is the non-profit organisation's first new class since 2014. . Florida Republicans objected to sections in the draft including \"Black Queer Studies\", \"Intersectionality\", \"Black Feminist Literary Thought\" and \"the Reparations Movement\".. The College Board pared back discussion of intersectionality and removed altogether sections entitled \"the Movement for Black Lives\" and \"Black Struggle in the 21st Century\".. Following objections from Florida, the organisation also expunged left-wing black authors Kimberlé Crenshaw, bell hooks and Ta-Nehisi Coates.. Sections on Black Lives Matter and slavery reparations have been removed from the exam and are now optional projects, while a new section on \"Black Conservatism\" has been added.. The National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organisation, lashed out at the revisions to the 234-page official curriculum, which was released on the first day of Black History Month. . \"As an organisation committed to advancing and protecting the interest of Black people, we believe the decision to move forward with the launch of this course without key components that are inextricably part of the Black experience is akin to educational malpractice,\" the group said in a statement. . The College Board argued it was uninfluenced by Florida Republicans and had made changes to the course before Mr DeSantis announced the state would block the material. . \"The fact of the matter is that this landmark course has been shaped over years by the most eminent scholars in the field, not political influence,\" the organisation said in a statement..

        "content": "The nearly four-hour search of the property related to a wider probe into the handling of classified documents. . The FBI has not commented on the search. As it was consensual, no search warrant was sought. . Mr Biden's lawyer, Bob Bauer, said the search was carried out \"without advance public notice\" in the interests of \"operational security and integrity\". . Following the search - which lasted from 08:30 to 12:00 local time - Mr Bauer said that \"no documents with classified markings were found\". . Some \"materials and handwritten notes\" that appear to date to Mr Biden's time as vice-president between 2009-17 were taken for \"further review\", Mr Bauer added. . The search is the latest in a series carried out at various locations, after classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center - an office space - in Washington DC in November. This was not made public at the time. . More documents were discovered at another of Mr Biden's homes in Wilmington, Delaware, in searches conducted in December and January. . The precise number of classified records recovered remains unclear - although at least a dozen were found during the January searches alone. . Mr Biden has said his team did \"what they should have done\" by alerting officials immediately, and that they are \"co-operating fully and completely\" with the investigation. . After the first of January's searches, Mr Biden told reporters the files were in a locked garage. . \"It's not like they are sitting in the street,\" he said. . The latest search comes a day after special counsel Robert Hur officially began his duties overseeing the probe into the documents. . President Donald Trump and former Vice-President Mike Pence have also been embroiled in controversy over the handling of classified documents.. In Mr Pence's case, a \"small number of documents bearing classified markings\" were found at his home in Carmel, Indiana, according to a letter sent to the National Archives by his lawyer. The documents were recovered by the FBI from a safe at the property on 19 January, with two boxes more delivered to the Archives on 23 January. . An August 2022 search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida uncovered dozens of boxes and about 11,000 documents, including about 100 with classified markings. . The search warrant came after attorneys representing Mr Trump had said all government records were returned. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he had declassified the documents taken with him.. The justice department search of Joe Biden's holiday home adds one more twist to a classified documents saga that has stretched on for nearly a month now and includes a special counsel overseeing the inquiry. . The FBI move could reveal how forthcoming and thorough the Biden team has been in reviewing the documents stored on his personal property. For the most part, the Biden lawyers have been conducting their own review of the president's personal residences without government investigators looking over their shoulders. While they found classified material at the president's Wilmington home, they have said that there were no such documents found at the president's beach house. . At the very least, the search will help quell some of the concerns expressed by Republicans that the government is holding Mr Biden to a lower level of scrutiny and suspicion than Donald Trump, who had his Mar-a-Lago estate searched by the FBI last August. When Mr Biden's lawyers first revealed they had found classified material at his home and personal office, the former president, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and other conservatives openly wondered why the current president wasn't targeted by government investigators as well.. Now, however, Mr Biden's defenders are pointing out that multiple Biden properties have been searched, but there is no indication that the FBI has investigated Mr Trump's New Jersey and New York homes..

The BBC cannot independently verify this figure. . Russia has claimed recent gains in the eastern Donbas region and its forces say they are moving in on the front-line town of Bakhmut after a battle that has lasted months and led to heavy loss of life on both sides.. Last month, Russian mercenaries and regular soldiers seized the nearby town of Soledar and on Wednesday a Russian-appointed official, Yan Gagin, said Bakhmut was \"operationally surrounded\".. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) recently said that Moscow could seek to \"undertake a decisive action\" and launch a \"big offensive\" in the east. . Mr Reznikov said Ukraine's commanders would seek to \"stabilise the front and prepare for a counter-offensive\" ahead of the rumoured Russian advance. . \"I have faith that the year 2023 can be the year of military victory,\" he said, adding that Ukraine's forces \"cannot lose the initiative\" they have achieved in recent months. . The defence minister was in France to strike a deal to purchase additional MG-200 air defence radars, which he said would \"significantly increase the capacity of the armed forces to detect air targets, including winged and ballistic missiles, and drones of various types\". . Mr Reznikov's comments come as Ukrainian intelligence alleges that President Putin has ordered his forces to seize the Donbas before the end of spring. . But speaking on Monday, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that there were no indications that Mr Putin had limited his military goals to seizing eastern regions of Ukraine.. \"That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea,\" Mr Stoltenberg said. . \"And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion - that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.\". Meanwhile, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that intense fighting was continuing in the Donbas region, where Russian forces and Wagner Group mercenaries have been trying to take the town of Bakhmut. . She added that Moscow's troops were also trying to seize Lyman - the former Russian logistics hub that Ukrainian troops retook in October. . \"Russian troops are actively trying to reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \"Our soldiers defend every centimetre of Ukrainian land,\" she said. . Speaking on Wednesday night, Mr Zelensky warned that the situation on the front lines of the conflict was testing his forces. . \"There is a certain increase in the occupiers' offensive actions at the front - in the east of our country, Mr Zelensky said. \"The situation is becoming even more severe.\".

        "content": "Protesters and mourners clash outside George Pell’s funeral in Sydney.. The Catholic cleric - who died last of surgery complications last month aged 81 - leaves a complicated legacy.. Formerly one of the Pope's top aides, he was Australia's top-ranked Catholic.. But his public image was tainted by unproven allegations he both concealed and committed child sexual abuse.. Those allegations loomed large in Sydney on Thursday. At one point, police outside St Mary's Cathedral intervened to separate angry mourners from chanting protesters. Earlier, one protester was arrested.. Inside the church, where Cardinal Pell served as the city's archbishop for over a decade, dignitaries including former Prime Ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott filled pews. Hundreds more gathered in a forecourt to watch the requiem Mass on big screens.. Noticeably absent were Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet - himself a devout Catholic. Both sent delegates.. In a message read to the congregation, Pope Francis praised Cardinal Pell's \"dedication to the gospel and to the Church\", while Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher lauded him as \"giant of the Catholic Church in Australia\" who had been wrongly demonised.. Over six decades, Cardinal Pell rose to prominence in the Church as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values. . He took on the role of Vatican treasurer in 2014 but left in 2017, returning to Australia to face trial on child sexual abuse charges. He was convicted, then later acquitted on appeal.. Many of Cardinal Pell's supporters believe he was unfairly persecuted, and that his record on the issue of child sexual abuse is part of what made him great.. Mr Abbott, who spoke at the funeral, claimed Cardinal Pell had been the first Australian Catholic to sack child abusers and report them to police. Others pointed to the landmark - but controversial - compensation scheme he set up.. \"He was greatest man I've ever known,\" Mr Abbott said.. Others who gathered to pay their respects said he was a kind man, quick to offer support and encouragement to those going through challenging times.. One mourner told the BBC he hopes the cardinal will be remembered \"for the things he did and not for the things that he was accused of\".. \"He was a good man,\" Nathan, 33, added. \"He fought for the rights of many people, contrary to popular belief.\". But outside the cathedral square, child abuse survivors remembered him as someone who had failed to protect them. . Some travelled from other states to tie ribbons to the church fence - a gesture seen in Australia as a tribute to victims of the Church abuse crisis. Most were cut down overnight on Wednesday by supporters of Cardinal Pell.. A landmark inquiry into Australian child sexual abuse found Cardinal Pell had personally known of abuse by priests as early as the 1970s and had failed to act. Cardinal Pell disputed the findings, saying they were \"not supported by evidence\".. Maureen, 75, came to leave a ribbon on behalf of a close friend, who was abused by a Catholic teacher.. \"I can't let today pass without standing for him. He is not well enough to stand for himself,\" she told the BBC. . Protesters gathering in parkland opposite the cathedral remembered Cardinal Pell as a \"monstrous bigot\".. \"Pell stood for blatant homophobia, misogyny... covering up abuse within the Catholic Church,\" organiser Kim Stern told the BBC.. \"We think it's pretty disgusting he's getting a send-off like this.\". Also out in force were police, trying to temper simmering tensions.. Thursday's funeral follows weeks of tense debate in Australia about Cardinal Pell's legacy.. Mourner Louisa Pastoois personally admired the cardinal, but she told the BBC she has accepted his legacy will be mixed.. \"The legacy he leaves behind in the Church, and the world… is something different,\" Louisa said.. \"I think there needed to be someone to take the blame for all that's happened in the church… there needs to be a face to the sins and unfortunately, it was his.\".

        "content": "The missing link had been the Philippines, which borders two of the biggest potential flashpoints, Taiwan and the South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea as Manila insists on calling it. . The US already had limited access to five sites under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - the new additions and expanded access, according to a statement from Washington, will \"allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges\", likely a veiled reference to countering China in the region. . The statement came after Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met Philippine President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr in Manila on Thursday. . The US hasn't said where the new bases are but three of them could be on Luzon, an island on the northern edge of the Philippines, the only large piece of land close to Taiwan - if you don't count China.. The deal, which in part reverses the US' departure from their former colony more than 30 years ago, is no small matter. . \"There is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not require access to the Philippines,\" says Gregory B Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. . \"The US is not looking for permanent bases. It's about places, not bases.\" . That is, it is seeking access to places where \"light and flexible\" operations involving supplies and surveillance can be run as and when needed, rather than bases where large numbers of troops will be stationed. . In other words, this is not a return to the 1980s, when the Philippines was home to 15,000 US troops and two of the largest American military bases in Asia, at Clark Field and nearby Subic Bay. . Then in 1991 the Philippine government called time. The Filipinos had recently overthrown the hated dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, and sending the old colonial masters home would further cement both democracy and independence. . The Vietnam war was long over, the Cold War was winding down, and China was as yet a military weakling. So, in 1992, the Americans went home - or at least most of them did. . Roll forward 30-odd years and another Marcos is back in the Malacañang Palace. . More important, China is no longer a military weakling, and it's knocking on the Philippines' front door. Manila has watched - horrified but powerless to intervene - as Beijing has set about redrawing the map of the South China Sea. Since 2014 China has built 10 artificial island bases, including one at Mischief Reef, deep inside the Philippines' own exclusive economic zone or EEZ. . Up to then relations between Manila and Beijing had been free of major problems, says Herman Kraft, a political science professor at University of the Philippines. . \"We had a live and let live situation in the South China Sea. But in 2012 they tried to seize control of Scarborough Shoal. Then in 2014 they began building the islands. The land grab by China changed the relationship.\". \"We have very limited capability against the threat from China,\" says former Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia Jr. . He says the Chinese have repeatedly broken promises not to  militarise their new South China Sea bases. . \"The Chinese have militarised those features and that puts more of our territory under threat. Only the US has the power to stop them. The Philippines cannot do it alone.\". But this time there will not be thousands of US marines and airmen filling the red-light districts of Olongapo or Angeles city again. . The history of violence and abuse by US troops in the Philippines is still a sensitive subject.  There are an estimated 15,000 children left with their Filipino mothers when their American fathers went home. . \"We have a long history of inequality in our relationship,\" says Renato Reyes, secretary general of New Patriotic Alliance, a left-wing group. \"The Philippines has been forced to shoulder the social costs. There's a history of rape, child abuse, and of toxic waste.\". The US' return to the Philippines is strongly opposed by the country's left-wing groups. . While there won't be as many troops as earlier, Washington is now asking for access to several new locations, some facing the South China Sea, others facing north towards Taiwan. Unofficial reports point to options in Cagayan, Zambales, Palawan and Isabela. . The first one faces Taiwan, the second the Scarborough shoal, and the third the Spratly Islands. Any new US facilities will be inside existing Philippine bases. US troops will come in small groups and on rotation.. The aim, says Mr Poling, will be to deter further territorial expansion by China in the South China Sea, while also providing a place for the US to watch Chinese military movements around Taiwan. . \"The Philippines has no way to deter China outside this alliance,\" he says. \"It's buying BrahMos missiles from India. The US would like to deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles. Together they can hold Chinese vessels.\" . With increasing concern about a conflict over Taiwan, the Philippines could offer a \"rear access area\" for US military operations, or even a place to evacuate refugees. . \"People forget there are between 150,000-200,000 Filipinos living in Taiwan,\" Mr Poling says. . But Manila is not about to become a full-blown member of an American alliance to challenge or resist China's rise, Professor Kraft cautions. . \"The Philippines is not doing those things like Australia and Japan, directly challenging Chinese interests in the South China Sea or East China Sea. President Marcos wants good relations with the US. But he also wants good relations with China for economic advantage.\" . Beijing too has indicated that it does not intend to allow a new base agreement between Manila and Washington to disrupt its relations with its neighbour. . In an editorial published to coincide with the arrival of the US defence secretary in Manila, China's state-run Global Times accused the US of \"setting a trap for the Philippines\" and \"trying to push the Philippines to the frontline of confrontation with China\".  . \"We are once again being caught in the middle,\" says Mr Reyes, who believes China is just as much a capitalist imperialist power as the US. . \"The Philippines still has a colonial mentality - it looks to the United States as its big brother.\" .
