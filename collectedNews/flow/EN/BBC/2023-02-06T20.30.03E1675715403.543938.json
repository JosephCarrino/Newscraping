        "content": "It is the latest in nearly nightly operations by the Israeli military targeting militants in the territory.. The last two weeks have been a particularly bloody period, with deadly Israeli raids and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday night's operation aimed to arrest a \"Hamas terrorist cell\" which it said was behind a gun attack a week earlier on a restaurant near a Jewish settlement close to Jericho. No-one was injured in that attack.. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is less prominent in the West Bank. Palestinian towns and villages there are mostly governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is dominated by Hamas' secular rival, Fatah.. The raid, coupled with activity by a Hamas cell, is unusual in Jericho, which has a relatively high concentration of Fatah-loyal PA security forces.. Witnesses say there was heavy gunfire during the incident in Jericho's large Aqabat Jabr refugee camp. Bullet holes and bloodstains could be seen in a small house at the centre of the fighting.  . IDF spokesperson Ran Kochav said soldiers \"neutralised the terrorists\", some of whom, he said, had been involved in the attack on the restaurant.. Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said those killed were its fighters.. The governor of Jericho, Jihad Abu al-Assal, said the bodies were taken away by the IDF. Eight people were also arrested, he said. . Israeli-Palestinian tensions have spiralled since an IDF raid against militants in the West Bank city of Jenin 10 days ago left 10 Palestinians, including two civilians, dead. Israeli security services said a \"terror squad\" had been planning an imminent attack.. Hours later, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Jewish worshippers and passers-by outside a synagogue in occupied East Jerusalem, killing seven. The following morning, a 13-year-old Palestinian shot a group of people, also in East Jerusalem, wounding an Israeli father and son.. Later in the day, security camera footage showed a gunman and an accomplice entering the restaurant near Vered Yeriho settlement, where about 30 people were sitting.  . Military sources said the man, armed with an assault rifle, fired one shot in the air before his weapon jammed and the pair left the scene in a car with an Israeli licence plate.. There have been international calls for calm, including from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken who met Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem and the West Bank following the recent bloodshed.. At least 37 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank so far this year, including militants and civilians, as the military continues operations there.. Last year in the West Bank, more than 150 Palestinians were killed, nearly all by Israeli forces. The dead included unarmed civilians, militant gunmen and armed attackers.. Meanwhile, a series of attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs targeting Israelis, as well as militant gunfire at troops during arrest raids, killed more than 30 people including civilians, police and soldiers. .

        "content": "Dramatic social media footage from first quake hitting Turkey and Syria. The toll, which currently stands at more than 2,600 people, has increased rapidly since the first earthquake struck early on Monday morning.. About 12 hours later, a second powerful tremor hit further north.. Rescuers have been combing through mountains of rubble in freezing and snowy conditions to find survivors.. Countries around the world are sending support to help the rescue efforts, including specialist teams, sniffer dogs and equipment.. The US Geological Survey said the 7.8 magnitude tremor struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the city of Gaziantep. . Seismologists said the first quake was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey. Survivors said it took two minutes for the shaking to stop.. The second quake had a magnitude of 7.5, and its epicentre was in the Elbistan district of Kahramanmaras province. . An official from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said it was independent of the earlier tremor and not an aftershock.. The death toll in Turkey has exceeded 1,650, while some 1,000 are confirmed to have died in Syria.. The WHO has warned that those numbers are likely to increase as much as eight times, as rescuers find more victims in the rubble.. \"We always see the same thing with earthquakes, unfortunately, which is that the initial reports of the numbers of people who have died or who have been injured will increase quite significantly in the week that follows,\" the WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, told AFP.. Ms Smallwood added that the snowy conditions will leave many people without shelter, adding to the dangers.. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones. . In 1999 a deadly quake killed more than 17,000 in the north-west. The country's worst earthquake disaster was in 1939 when 33,000 people died in Turkey's eastern Erzincan province.. One Kahramanmaras resident, Melisa Salman, said living in an earthquake zone meant she was used to \"being shaken\", but Monday's tremor was \"the first time we have ever experienced anything like that\".. \"We thought it was the apocalypse,\" she said.. Many thousands of people have been injured - with at least 9,700 people hurt in Turkey and 2,000 in Syria. Those numbers have also been steadily rising.. Many of the victims are in war-torn northern Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border. There have been dozens of fatalities reported in rebel-held areas.. Thousands of buildings have collapsed, and several videos show the moment they fell, as onlookers ran for cover. Many buildings that were four or five storeys high are now flattened, roads have been destroyed and there are huge mountains of rubble as far as the eye can see.. Among the buildings destroyed was .  that has stood for more than 2,000 years. . And a shopping mall in the city of Diyarbakir collapsed, a BBC Turkish correspondent there reported.. Turkey's energy infrastructure has also been damaged, and videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey. Social media users claimed they were caused by damage to gas pipelines. . Turkey's energy minister Fatih Donmez confirmed there had been serious damage to the infrastructure, but did not mention the explosions.. The Turkish Red Crescent has called for citizens to make blood donations, and the organisation's president, Kerem Kınık, .  that additional blood and medical products were being sent to the affected region.. Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support.. UN Secretary General António Guterres has called for an international response to the crisis, saying that many of the families hit by the disaster were \"already in dire need of humanitarian aid in areas where access is a challenge\". . The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. The UK has said it will send 76 specialists, equipment and rescue dogs.. France, Germany, Israel, and the US have also pledged to help. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered help to both Turkey and Syria, as has Iran.. Turkey's interior minister, Suleymon Soylu, said 10 cities were affected by the initial quake including Hatay, Osmaniye, Adiyaman, Malatya, Sanliurfa, Adana, Diyarbakir and Kilis. . School has been suspended in those cities for at least a week.. This video can not be played. Diyarbakir, Turkey: 'People are still trapped under the rubble'. A volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas of north-western Syria, fought back tears as he described the devastation in Sarmada, near the border with Turkey.. \"Many buildings in different cities and villages in north-western Syria collapsed,\" he told the BBC.. \"Still now, many families are under the rubble. We are trying to save them but it's a very hard task for us.. \"We need help. We need the international community to do something, to help us, to support us. North-western Syria is now a disaster area,\" he added.. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel..

        "content": "A similar balloon was shot down in US airspace by military jets on Saturday amid allegations that it was being used for surveillance. . China has denied accusations of spying, saying it was monitoring the weather.. The incident has led to a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.. On Friday - .  - US military officials said a second Chinese balloon had been spotted over Latin America. . On Monday, China admitted an aircraft had \"accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace\".. Ms Mao told reporters the second balloon had \"deviated greatly\" from its intended route, citing the aircraft's \"limited manoeuvrability\" and the weather conditions.. \"The unmanned airship in question that came from China is of a civilian nature and used for flight tests,\" she added.. \"China is a responsible country and has always strictly abided by international law in order to inform and properly deal with all parties concerned, without posing any threat to any country.\". At the weekend, Colombia's air force said an object with \"characteristics similar to those of a balloon\" had been detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft.. Colombia said it had followed the object until it left the airspace, adding that it did not represent a threat to national security.. Meanwhile, work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.. US President Joe Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. . The US believes the balloon was being used to monitor sensitive military sites.. Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because \"it has propellers on it\".. \"This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence,\" he added.. Relations between China and the US have been strained by the incident, with the Pentagon calling it an \"unacceptable violation\" of its sovereignty. A planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.. China has lodged a formal complaint with the US embassy in Beijing over the incident.. ",

        "content": "Emergency rescue teams said many buildings are damaged or destroyed and that people remain trapped under the rubble.. The region is home to millions of refugees displaced by the civil war. . Control of northern Syria is divided between the government, Kurdish-led forces and other rebel groups. They remain embroiled in conflict. . Even before the earthquake the situation in much of the region was critical, with freezing weather, crumbling infrastructure and a cholera outbreak causing misery for many of those who live there. . According to separate figures from the Syrian government and the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas, more than 1,000 people have died in the region so far after the earthquake. . A video published on social media, and verified by the BBC, showed a building in Aleppo crashing to the ground as onlookers rushed to safety. . The 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 local time (01:17 GMT) at a depth of 17.9km (11 miles) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Twelve hours later, a second quake, which was nearly as large, struck 130km (80 miles) to the north. . This video can not be played. Syrian Civil Defence: \"We need the international community to do something\". A spokesperson for the White Helmets described north-western Syria as a \"disaster area\" and said that families remain trapped under the rubble. . In government-controlled areas, all of the country's emergency services have been made available, including the army and student volunteers. However, BBC Monitoring's Hesham Shawish, a Middle East specialist, says this is not enough to deal with the scale of the destruction. . The International Rescue Committee, a charity with more than 1,000 members of staff on the ground in opposition-held areas of Syria, said it was already dealing with the region's first cholera outbreak in a decade and preparing for approaching snowstorms when the quake hit.. Freezing conditions and torrential rain were hampering rescue efforts. . Mark Kaye, the organisation's Middle East advocacy director, described the situation as a \"crisis within a crisis within a crisis\" and said vast swathes of the region are beyond contact because of damage to communication networks. . Some people in remote areas are said to have been displaced as many as 20 times due to the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into violence.. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and fighters have been killed in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis has been compounded in recent years by an unprecedented economic downturn.. Entire neighbourhoods and vital infrastructure, including hospitals, across Syria were already in ruins as a result of the fighting before the earthquake struck.. The government has called for international assistance - appealing specifically to United Nations member states, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian groups. . However, it has reportedly rejected claims that it has asked for Israel's aid. The two countries are still technically at war and don't currently have any diplomatic relations.. Dozens of other nations have promised help, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. The UN said it has teams on the ground that are assessing the situation and providing assistance.. Russia, which already has a military presence in Syria due to its involvement in the civil war on the government's side, has also pledged its support. . ",
