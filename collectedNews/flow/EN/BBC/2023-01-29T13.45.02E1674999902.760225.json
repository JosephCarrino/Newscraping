        "content": "Watch: New footage shows deadly arrest of Tyre Nichols. Scorpion stands for \"Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\".. The unit is a 50-person team tasked with bringing down crime levels in particular areas.. But now it is being abolished after its officers were seen beating Mr Nichols, 29, in the videos from 7 January.. In a statement, the department said \"it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate\" the unit. . \"While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonour on the title Scorpion, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department, take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted,\" it added.. Mr Nichols' family welcomed the decision in a statement from their lawyers, calling it \"both appropriate and proportional to the tragic death of Tyre Nichols, and also a decent and just decision for all citizens of Memphis\".. The unit was launched in October 2021 with a focus on high-impact crimes, such as car thefts and gang-related offences.. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired last week.. They were taken into custody on Thursday and each faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.. Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner Jr said two deputy sheriffs who \"appeared on the scene following\" the confrontation have also been suspending pending an internal investigation. . \"The unit that murdered Tyre has been permanently disbanded,\" a protester shouted into a megaphone in Memphis and the crowd erupted into cheers. . Despite the rain, the group of fewer than 100 protesters had gathered in the square in front of the Memphis Police headquarters to demand change to a system of policing that they said makes a habit of brutalising black people in Memphis and across the country.   . \"Memphis is taking a stand,\" said Casio Montez, one of the protest organisers. \"This means we're doing something right.\". Mr Montez vowed that he and other community organisers would continue to pressure Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis and city officials until \"the community's demands are met\", including reforming the department's organised crime unit.  . In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Chief Davis said the Scorpion unit was created to be \"more responsive\" and \"more proactive\" to gun violence in the city. But she acknowledged that the officers who brutally beat Tyre Nichols \"decided to go off the rails\".   . \"We are doing an individual evaluation of all units,\" she said. \"This is a necessary step. We want to be fully transparent to the community.\"  . But for some, the problem of police violence is more deeply rooted than any reform can address. . At the rally Saturday, Memphis native Allie Watkins held a sign that proclaimed, \"All cops uphold white supremacy.\"  . The sign is historically accurate, she said, because the history of policing in America began with slave patrols.  . \"This is not an issue of corruption in the United States, this is an issue of the fact that the system has been built against black bodies,\" she said.  If the system is broken, she added, the only way to fix it is to start again.. Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January.. Mr Nichols was black, as are all five officers charged in the case.. Memphis Police Department released four graphic videos of the traffic stop and its violent aftermath on Friday, totalling more than an hour of footage.. Peaceful protests took place in Memphis on Friday night after the video was released, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in the city, while small-scale demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country.. Many protesters held banners demanding justice for Mr Nichols and an end to \"police terror\".. Lawyers for Mr Nichols' family likened the assault to the 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King.. The Scorpion programme was touted by Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland in a speech a year ago. He said the city used crime data \"to determine where the unit will conduct its enforcement activities within the city\".. From October 2021 until January 2022, the unit made 566 arrests, he said. They also seized more than $100,000 in cash, 270 vehicles and 253 weapons.. In the wake of Mr Nichols' death, one local man, Cornell McKinney, told a Memphis-area TV network that he had a tense encounter with the unit on 3 January, just days before the incident involving Mr Nichols.. Mr McKinney alleges that the officers - who were travelling in unmarked vehicles - threatened to \"blow his head off\", pointed a weapon at his head and accused him of carrying drugs.. He complained to the Memphis Police Department after the incident, but says he has not heard anything back.. One of the officers that arrested Mr Nichols had previously been sued by a man who accused him of beating him when he was a prisoner eight years ago.. ",

        "content": "Mr Babis - who served as prime minister between 2017 and 2021 - conceded defeat in a speech to supporters soon after the results were announced. . The ex-general will replace Milos Zeman, whose second term ends in March. . The second-round runoff between Mr Babis and Mr Pavel was portrayed as a contest between populist oligarchy and liberal democracy.. The elections' results follow an ill-tempered campaign marred by alleged death threats and disinformation. . Earlier this week Mr Pavel was forced to take to Twitter to deny rumours of his own death, circulated by a fake website and emails hosted by Russia's Yandex server.  . The disinformation was condemned by Mr Babis, who a few days ago cancelled all remaining in-person campaign appearances over fears for his personal safety after receiving an anonymous death threat.. Speaking after the announcement of the results on Saturday, Mr Pavel said values such as truth, dignity, respect and humility had won. . \"The vast majority of Czechs share these values, and it's time to return them to the castle and to politics,\" he added. . There were thunderous chants of \"Pavel na Hrad\" (Pavel to the Castle) - a deliberate echo of the chants of \"Havel na Hrad\" that filled the streets and squares of Czechoslovakia in November 1989. . Indeed Mr Pavel, a firm advocate of Czech membership of Nato and the EU, has often invoked the spirit of Vaclav Havel, the playwright, dissident and .  after the Velvet Revolution against communist rule. . And his victory will be seen as an affirmation his country is firmly rooted in the West.. In congratulating Mr Pavel, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she welcomed his \"strong commitment to our European values\". . Other world leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Kosovo's president Vjosa Osmani, have also taken to social media to congratulate the newly elected president. . Meanwhile, Slovakia's president Zuzana Caputova - a fellow liberal, pro-western politician - made a surprise appearance on stage alongside Mr Pavel within several hours of the results being announced. . There was rapturous applause from Mr Pavel's supporters, many of them dressed in the flannel shirts that have become an unofficial symbol of his campaign. . Across town, at the offices of ANO - the political party created by Mr Babis - there were smiles but the disappointment was palpable. . \"I wish you a world without Babis. Forget about Babis. Try to live without Babis,\" the former prime minister told reporters, in a barb at his many opponents on Twitter. . \"Stop waking up in the morning with hatred towards Babis and falling asleep with hatred towards Babis,\" he said, after congratulating his opponent and denying he had run a negative campaign.  . Mr Pavel has backed keeping the Czech Republic anchored in the European Union and Nato and has come out strongly in favour of further military aid for Ukraine to fight against Russia's invasion.. By contrast, Mr Babis was forced to backtrack earlier this week after he suggested that he would not live up to the country's obligations to defend a fellow Nato member if attacked. . \"I want peace, I don't want war,\" Mr Babis said during a televised debate. \"In no situation would I send our children or the children of our women to war.\" . In the Czech Republic, the role of president is a mostly ceremonial but still influential post. The presidents choose prime ministers and central bank bosses, as well as having a say in foreign policy. . ",

        "content": "The new measures also include depriving an attacker's family members of residency and social security rights.. The full cabinet is due to consider the measures on Sunday.. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised a \"strong\" and \"swift\" response ahead of the security cabinet meeting.. Israel's army also said it would be reinforcing troop numbers in the occupied West Bank.. \"When civilians have guns, they can defend themselves,\" the controversial far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told reporters outside a Jerusalem hospital.. The measures will revoke the rights to social security of \"the families of terrorists that support terrorism\", the security cabinet said.. The proposals are in step with proposals from Mr Netanyahu's far-right political allies, who allowed him to return to power last month.. The announcement came after Israeli police said a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was behind a shooting in Jerusalem's Silwan neighbourhood on Saturday that left an Israeli father and son seriously wounded.. An Israeli police force spokesperson previously said the assailant ambushed five people as they made their way to prayers, leaving two in a \"critical condition\". The 13-year-old was shot and injured by passers-by and is being held in hospital. . In a separate shooting on Friday at a synagogue in East Jerusalem, seven people were killed and at least three more injured as they gathered for prayers at the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The gunman was shot dead at the scene.. The man behind Friday's synagogue attack was identified by local media as a Palestinian from East Jerusalem.. Police have arrested 42 people in connection with that attack.. Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai called it \"one of the worst attacks we have encountered in recent years\". . Palestinian militant groups praised the attack, but did not say one of their members was responsible.. Mr Netanyahu called for calm and urged citizens to allow security forces to carry out their tasks, while the military said additional troops would be deployed in the occupied West Bank. . \"I call again on all Israelis - don't take the law into your hands,\" Mr Netanyahu said. He thanked several world leaders - including US President Joe Biden - for their support. . Tensions have been high since nine Palestinians - both militants and civilians - were killed during an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.  . This was followed by rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, which Israel responded to with air strikes.. Since the start of January, 30 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed in the West Bank. . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suspended its security co-operation arrangements with Israel after Thursday's raid in Jenin.. Friday's synagogue shooting happened on Holocaust Memorial Day, which commemorates the six million Jews and other victims who were killed in the Holocaust by the Nazi regime in Germany.  . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, saying that one of the victims was a Ukrainian woman. . \"Terror must have no place in today's world - neither in Israel nor Ukraine,\" he said in a tweet. . British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly wrote on Twitter: \"To attack worshippers at a synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day, and during Shabbat, is horrific. We stand with our Israeli friends.\" . President Joe Biden talked to Mr Netanyahu and offered all \"appropriate means of support\", the White House said.. Shortly after the incident, Mr Netanyahu visited the site, as did Mr Ben-Gvir.. The controversial national security minister promised to bring safety back to Israel's streets, but there is rising anger that he has not yet done so, the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem said. . United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \"deeply worried about the current escalation of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory\", a spokesperson said.. \"This is the moment to exercise utmost restraint,\" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.. On Saturday, the European Union expressed alarm at heightened tensions and urged Israel to use lethal force only as a last resort. . \"The European Union fully recognises Israel's legitimate security concerns - as evidenced by the latest terrorist attacks - but it has to be stressed that lethal force must only be used as a last resort when it is strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,\" said the EU's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell.. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of the international community.. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the future capital of a hoped-for independent state.. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.
