        "content": "The US European Command said Tuesday's crash was the result of an \"unprofessional act by the Russians\".. Russia said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and denied that the two aircraft made contact. . The Russian defence ministry also said the US aircraft was flying with its transponders turned off. Transponders are communications devices that allow the aircraft to be tracked. . The incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT), according to the US military. . \"Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,\" the statement said. . Several times before the collision the Su-27 fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said. . MQ-9 Reaper drones are surveillance aircraft with a 20m (66ft) wingspan.. Tensions have risen over the Black Sea ever since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine the US and the UK have stepped up reconnaissance and surveillance flights, though always operating in international airspace. . The key question is whether Tuesday's encounter was an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work, or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down. . According to the US, there has been a \"pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots\" interacting with allied aircraft in the region. . So this could simply have been a mistake by a Russian pilot who got too close as they \"buzzed\" the drone. But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.. In that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.. Western allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia. But this incident over the Black Sea is just that. The US will now have to evaluate its response.. As US military commanders warned in their statement, this was a dangerous act that \"could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation\". . ",

        "content": "The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January.. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington.. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an \"epidemic\".. But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives.. Mr Biden's executive order  - which does not require the approval of Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks.. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it.. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law.. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law.. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: \"While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before.\". The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters.. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors.. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired.. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over \"red flag\" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour.. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws.. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it \"would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives\", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will \"double down on the progress made\" in last year's bill..

        "content": "Joe Biden: \"Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs\". Under the Aukus pact Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs - at least three - from the US.. The allies will also work to create a new fleet using cutting-edge tech, including UK-made Rolls-Royce reactors.. Beijing has strongly criticised the significant naval deal.. Its foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the three nations of \"walking further and further down the path of error and danger\".. China's UN mission had earlier also accused the Western allies of setting back nuclear non-proliferation efforts.. But US President Joe Biden said the deal was aimed at bolstering peace in the region and stressed the submarines would be \"nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed\". . Speaking alongside the UK and Australian prime ministers - Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese - in San Diego, California, Mr Biden said the deal would not jeopardise Australia's commitment to being a nuclear-free country. . For Australia, it is a major upgrade to the US ally's military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology. . The submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time. . Under the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.. From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more. . After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS. . This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.. President Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open. . \"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.. He also pledged of $4.6bn (£3.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.. Australia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (£201bn) over 30 years - marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".. Anthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs. The UK PM also said thousands of jobs would be created in Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, where some of the construction would take place.. Mr Sunak said that in the 18 months since the Aukus alliance was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown. . \"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division,\" Mr Sunak said.. As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also .  over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states.. The Aukus security alliance - announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing's foreign ministry last week reiterated its position that the pact risked creating an arms race.. But the three Western countries say the security deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific. . While all three leaders have stressed how the deal will strengthen their co-operation, it hasn't been without its political fallout.. In 2021, Australia .  in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris. . Australia also faces a delicate diplomatic situation with China - its largest trading partner. Analysts say the question will be whether it can continue to strengthen its military ties with US, while fostering commercial ties with Beijing.. ",

The parliament's discipline committee stripped him of his status because of the continued absence.. Voters had elected Mr Higashitani to the upper house last July. He is better known as GaaSyy on YouTube where he is famous for his celebrity gossip videos.. Expulsion is the most severe punishment a lawmaker can receive. It has happened only two times since 1950 and this is the first time an MP has been expelled due to continued absence. . The chamber is set to formalise the decision later this week.. The lawmaker - who has been nicknamed 'No-show MP'- is believed to be living in the United Arab Emirates. . He has so far refused to attend parliament because he fears being arrested over fraud allegations, and defamation claims from celebrities, Japanese media reported.. He is one of two members elected from the Seijika-joshi-48 opposition party. The single-issue party - formerly known as the NHK Party - only calls for reforms to Japan's public broadcaster. . The party regularly changes its name for publicity reasons, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has reported. . Last week, parliament had demanded Mr Higashitani fly to Tokyo to deliver an in-person apology in the chamber for his absence. Lawmakers had said this would be a last chance for redemption.. But Mr Higashitani failed to show up at the plenary session. . Instead, he announced on his YouTube channel that he was going to Turkey - and that he was planning to donate his salary to the Turkish earthquake relief.. His absence angered the Senate - whose members voted for his expulsion this week.. His sole other party colleague, Hamada Satoshi, argued that it was illegal to expel Mr Higashitani because of his absence from sessions. However the committee voted unanimously to expel him.. ",

        "content": "The workers are striking over the Macron government's proposals to raise the pension age from 62 to 64.. Other cities including Nantes, Rennes and Le Havre are also affected.. Refuse collectors joined the pension strikes a week ago and the Paris authority says half of the city's districts, which are covered by council workers, have been hit by the action. Three waste treatment sites have been blockaded and a fourth partially closed.. On Monday, the Paris authority said 5,600 tonnes of waste had yet to be collected.. One commentator on Europe1 radio described the situation as an all-you-can-eat buffet for the six million rats of Paris, double the human population.. In the 10 districts covered by private companies the service was running almost normally, Paris council said. Some reports indicated activists were trying to prevent collections from going ahead.. And one private company was also seen on Monday night by news channel BFMTV picking up waste in one of the big central districts, the sixth, which is normally covered by council workers. Similar bin collections were going on in two other districts on the western fringe of the city.. Leading council official Emmanuel Grégoire said the situation was complicated but the authority was prioritising intervention for public safety, with a focus on clearing food markets, bin bags lying on the ground and ensuring pedestrian safety.. \"The strike triggers a change in rat behaviour,\" specialist Romain Lasseur told Le Parisien newspaper. \"They'll rummage around in bins, reproduce there, and leave their urine and droppings. We have a worrying health risk for refuse collectors and the general population.\". The capital's bin workers are due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue their action. Refuse collectors currently retire at the age of 57 because of difficult working conditions and under the reforms they would have to work for two more years.. Opponents of the Socialist mayor of Paris have seized on the strike as only adding to an existing crisis. . \"Anne Hidalgo promised to double the clean-up budget and Parisians clearly see Paris becoming dirtier and dirtier,\" complained Rachida Dati who runs the seventh district for the right-wing Republicans. . France's unions have stepped up action against the government's unpopular retirement reforms which are currently going through parliament.. Several operators at French refineries were on strike on Tuesday for a seventh day in a row, but only a small proportion of French petrol stations have had to close.. The measures were backed by the upper house or Senate on Saturday and will next go to a joint committee of MPs from both houses on Wednesday to decide on the final text. A final vote could reach the National Assembly and Senate on Thursday.. President Emmanuel Macron's party lacks a majority in the lower house so victory on the bill is by no means secure. . The government needs 287 votes, and even if it can persuade all its 250 MPs to back the reforms it will still need to find another 37 lawmakers from other parties to back the higher pension age.. Many of those extra votes are likely to be Republicans and the government is keen to avoid forcing through the legislation without a vote, which it could do by triggering a 49:3 article of the constitution..

        "content": "Is this the start of a financial crisis?. US stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, and some of the US regional banks saw big gains. . Regulators in the UK, the US and Asia have acted quickly to try to contain any fallout from SVB's demise.. The Bank of Japan moved to keep financial markets stable after its leading stock index fell 2.1%.. Investors have been worried that other banks may be exposed to similar problems.. Until last week's shock collapse, SVB was a relatively little-known bank - it was the 16th largest in the US.. However, a decision to invest in assets such as government bonds when interest rates were at record lows left SVB exposed to huge losses when central banks started raising rates.  . There is concern that other banks could be caught out in the same way. . Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"I think SVB was a badly-run bank that took too much risk in one sector and was caught out by higher interest rates which if managed properly it would not have been.. \"But higher interest rates will bring more challenges to banks, the economy and start-up firms for sure.\" . In the US, shares in a number of regional banks had plunged on Monday on worries over wider problems. But as trading began on Tuesday, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank - which had seen its share price tank by 62% on Monday - jumped 50%, one of a number of firms whose shares were staging a recovery.. The three main indexes were also positive, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading almost 1% higher in early afternoon trade in New York, the S&P 500 up more than 1% and the Nasdaq roughly 2% higher. . The rally followed steep losses overnight in Japan, where major lenders such as the country's largest bank MUFG, had seen their share price tumble by more than 8%. . An index of Japanese banking stocks, known as the Topix Banks Index, plunged by 7.4%, despite reassurances from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). . \"Japanese financial institutions' direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,\" said a BoJ official. . The European Stoxx banking index also opened lower on Tuesday but then recovered to .  nearly 3% higher.. Separately Credit Suisse's share price continued to tumble after it admitted it found \"material weaknesses\" in its internal controls over financial reporting. It also announced that it would slash its bonus pot - although it said bankers will still get a share of 1bn Swiss francs (£900m).. Credit Suisse's share price fell by 1.9%.. In the UK, bank shares - which saw sharp falls on Monday - were all mostly higher by Tuesday afternoon. The FTSE 100 closed up almost 1.2%.. But shares in HSBC, which rescued SVB's UK business for £1, closed down 1%.. SVB was taken over by US regulators at the weekend after a surprise sale of some bonds last Wednesday sparked a run on the bank. . By the end of Thursday, customers of the bank - mainly in the technology sector - . .. New York-based Signature Bank, which focuses on the cryptocurrency industry, also collapsed at the weekend.. There is now speculation that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will curb an interest rate rise next week to quell turmoil in the banking sector. . The Fed has been raising interest rates to calm the pace at which prices are rising - which is known as inflation.. On Tuesday, new figures revealed that the annual rate of US inflation eased to 6% in February, down from 6.4% in January.. The US Fed has been raising its key interest rate by as much as 0.75 percentage points, although in February its rate-setters voted for a smaller 0.25 percentage point increase. . ",
