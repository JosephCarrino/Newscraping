The packages were strung up with buoys and some labelled with a Batman symbol.. Pictures released by New Zealand police and defence officials also showed cocaine packets labelled with a black four-leaf clover symbol.. These were the \"trademark logos\" for the drug producers, believed to be in South America, said New Zealand officials.. \"This is the largest find of illicit drugs by New Zealand agencies, by some margin,\" said New Zealand's police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday.. \"It is more than New Zealand would use in 30 years,\" he added.. New Zealand's navy deployed a vessel to retrieve the massive shipment last week, which comprised 81 bales of cocaine.. They were brought to Auckland in New Zealand's North Island on Tuesday and taken to a security facility to be documented and destroyed, officials said. . \"We believe we have dealt a significant blow to an international criminal syndicate's operation,\" Mr Coster said.. Authorities did not disclose details of the operation or how they found the drugs. But they said their partners in the Five Eyes intelligence group - which includes Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US - had provided assistance.. ",

        "content": "Prosecutors said there was evidence that Mr Putin decided to provide the missile to Moscow-backed separatists.. There is no suggestion that Mr Putin ordered the aircraft be shot down.. In November, a Dutch court found three men - two Russians and a Ukrainian - guilty of murder in absentia for their part in the downing of MH17.. Russia, which has denied all involvement in the downing of the plane, dismissed these verdicts as \"scandalous\" and politically motivated. . The prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had exhausted all leads and could not continue with any more criminal proceedings.. The Boeing 777 was flying from the Dutch capital to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014 during a conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.. Of the 298 passengers and crew, 196 were Dutch while many of the other passengers came from Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Belgium and other countries.. In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team said the court ruled that Moscow had \"overall control\" over the Donetsk People's Republic, which controlled the area in July 2014. . It cited recorded telephone conversations where Russian officials said that the decision to provide military support \"rests with the President\".. \"There is concrete information that the separatists' request was presented to the president, and that this request was granted,\" it said. . But it adds that is not known whether the request \"explicitly mentions\" the system used to shoot down MH17.. \"Although we speak of strong indications, the high bar of complete and conclusive evidence is not reached,\" investigators said. . \"Furthermore, the President enjoys immunity in his position as Head of State.\". This video can not be played. The Dutch Safety Board released an animated video showing the flight path of the plane. The Joint Investigation Team is made up of members from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - the countries worst affected by the shooting down of MH17.. The team wanted to prove the identities of the missile's crew members, and who was in the chain of command, but admitted that was not possible for now.. Piet Ploeg lost his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew on MH17. He said he was glad prosecutors had laid out their evidence for Mr Putin's involvement.. \"We can't do a lot with it, Putin can't be prosecuted,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to know who was ultimately responsible and that's clear.\". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said in a statement that it is a \"bitter disappointment\" there is insufficient evidence to warrant further prosecutions but that the JIT's announcement \"does not mean the end of the criminal justice process.\". In January, .  against Russia over the downing of MH17.. \"Let me be clear: we will not stop,\" said Mr Rutte. \"Since 2014, we have become all too familiar with the pattern of obstruction, untruths and injustice from Russia and its president, Putin. We will continue to call the Russian Federation to account for its role in this tragedy.\". ",
