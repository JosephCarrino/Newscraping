        "content": "But it is also said to have used the tech to target Russian positions - breaking policies set out by SpaceX.. A Ukrainian official said companies had to choose which \"side\" they were on.. They could join Ukraine and \"the right to freedom\", or pick Russia and \"its 'right' to kill and seize territories\", tweeted presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.. At an event in Washington DC on Wednesday, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell explained that Starlink technology was \"never meant to be weaponised\".. She made reference to Ukraine's alleged use of Starlink to control drones, and stressed that the equipment had been provided for humanitarian use.. Unmanned aircraft have played an important role in the war, having been used by Kyiv to search out Russian troops, drop bombs and counter Moscow's own drone attacks.. Russia has been accused of attempting to jam Starlink signals by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.. Ms Shotwell confirmed that it was acceptable for the Ukrainian military for deploy Starlink technology \"for comms\", but said her intent was \"never to have them use it for offensive purposes\".. She said the company had taken steps to \"limit\" the abilities of the Ukrainian armed forces to use Starlink in an offensive way - without giving further details. . The executive said she could not answer a question on whether these efforts were the cause of outages to the Starlink service late last year. . After invading its neighbour in February last year, Russia quickly looked to close down local internet services and to block social media.. The first Starlink dishes - or terminals - were provided to Ukraine soon after, in an effort to ensure people stayed connected.. They work by connecting to satellites in low-Earth orbit.. As well as the terminals sent directly by the company itself, others have been funded by the foreign governments.. In October, Mr Musk signalled that he could not continue funding Starlink in Ukraine, before rapidly reversing his position.. In a tweet last week, the billionaire again addressed the issue and acknowledged that there was a dilemma at work. . \"SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part,\" he wrote. . \"However, we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don't part.\" . ",

        "content": "The shipment had been due before the disaster, which caused damage to roads and temporarily halted deliveries.. Local rescuers expressed disappointment at the failure to send the special equipment they need to save lives.. \"The UN aid... is the regular and periodic assistance that has been occurring since before the earthquake,\" . , an organisation whose volunteer first responders operate in the region.. \"It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble.\". , as well as basic relief items and solar lamps, to cover the needs of at least 5,000 people.. \"We are working very closely with authorities to support in any way we can and hope that aid will quickly reach those most impacted,\" said its director general, António Vitorino. . UN Secretary General António Guterres said: \"More help is on the way, but much more is needed.\". The White Helmets have reported at least 1,970 deaths since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in the early hours of Monday. . They have warned that the figure is likely to rise significantly because hundreds of families are still trapped beneath 418 destroyed and more than 1,300 partially destroyed buildings.. This video can not be played. Watch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horror. On Thursday morning, as the window to find survivors narrowed, the White Helmets said the lack of heavy machinery was significantly hampering their work and appealed to the international community for help.. Harsh winter weather conditions have also complicated the operation, while major power outages have resulted in fuel shortages at hospitals overwhelmed by the 2,950 injured survivors.. \"The situation is very bad. And there is no aid,\" Ibrahim Khalil Menkaween told Reuters news agency in the town of Jindayris.. The 56-year-old, who lost seven members of his family including his wife, was waiting next to the remains of his home with a body bag to give to rescuers. . \"I'm holding this bag for when they bring out my brother, and my brother's young son, and both of their wives,\" he explained.. Even before the earthquake struck, 4.1 million people - most of them women and children - were relying on humanitarian assistance to survive in the opposition-held north-west, which is controlled by a jihadist alliance and Turkish-backed rebel factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.. Last year, about 600 lorries carrying aid crossed from Turkey each month via Bab al-Hawa, the only border crossing that the UN is authorised to use. All other deliveries are meant to go via Damascus, although in the past the government has facilitated only a small amount of so-called \"cross-line\" aid.. The UN special envoy for Syria said on Thursday that earthquake-affected regions of the country had received \"nowhere near enough\" lifesaving aid and warned that assistance must not be \"politicised\".. \"We need it urgently through the fastest, most direct and most effective routes. They need more of absolutely everything,\" Geir Pedersen told reporters in Geneva.. He was speaking after a meeting of the UN's humanitarian task force for Syria, which includes Russia and Iran, whose forces have backed the Syrian government in the country's 12-year civil war, as well as Turkey, the United States and the European Union, which support the opposition.. The UN top aid official in Syria, El-Mostafa Benlamlih, has said the country is experiencing a \"crisis on top of a crisis\", with 10.9 million people affected by earthquake nationwide.. Aid from countries including Iran, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Egypt, India and Venezuela has already reached government-controlled areas, where the health ministry says at least 1,260 people have been killed. . The government has suggested that lifting US and EU economic sanctions would help to speed up its emergency response. However, the EU has said the sanctions do not prohibit the export of food, medicines or medical equipment.. ",

        "content": "Along with lyricist Hal David, he also wrote numerous movie themes including What's New, Pussycat, Alfie, and The Look Of Love, a major hit for Dusty Springfield.. Bacharach died on Wednesday at home in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Tina Brausam said.. Known for his airborne melodies and sumptuous orchestral arrangements, Bacharach was one of the most important songwriters of the 20th Century.. Over his career, he scored 50 chart hits in the US and UK, working with artists including Dionne Warwick, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Barbra Streisand, Tom Jones, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello.. Bacharach won three Oscars, two Golden Globes and six competitive Grammy Awards, and was hailed as music's \"greatest living composer\" when he accepted the Grammy lifetime achievement honour in 2008.. Tributes flooded in from across the music world. .  said Bacharach was \"a hero of mine and very influential on my work\", adding: \"He was a giant in the music business. His songs will live forever,\" he added.. Former Oasis star . : \"RIP Maestro. It was a pleasure to have known you.\" . Oscar-winning songwriter Diane Warren said the field had \"lost its Beethoven\", while film and TV composer David Arnold agreed he was \"one of the greatest songwriters of all time\".. The Kinks guitarist .  Bacharach was \"probably one of the most influential songwriters of our time\" and \"a great inspiration\".. Charlatans frontman .  Bacharach left \"one of the greatest songwriting legacies in the history of ever\", adding: \"Farewell Burt Bacharach, you were a king.\". Bacharach's music touched multiple genres, from cool jazz and rhythm and blues, to bossa nova and traditional pop - but they shared one thing in common: you could recognise them within a couple of notes.. It was a style inspired by his tutor, French jazz musician Darius Milhaud. . \"His observation was: Never be ashamed of something that's melodic, one could whistle,\" Bacharach recalled. \"That was a valuable lesson I learned from him. Never forgot that one. Never be afraid of something that you can whistle.\". Born in Missouri, Bacharach grew up in New York City, where he first studied cello, drums and piano as a child. . Enraptured by jazz and be-bop, he would often sneak out to watch sets by his heroes Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and began playing in jazz bands of his own in the 1940s.. After graduating from school, he studied music theory and composition. Even when his education was interrupted by a spell in the military, he toured army bases as a uniformed concert pianist.. After returning home, he toured with Marlene Dietrich, becoming her personal conductor - but said his early success was all down to luck.. \"I wasn't chasing it. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was caught in the drift of things,\" he later reflected. \"I'm not a person who will walk over people, kill people, step on people to get to the next place where they want to be. Things just happened for me. I was very fortunate.\". In the 1950s, he was hired to work in New York's Brill Building, an epicentre of the music industry, and started writing country-rock smashes like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Only Love Can Break A Heart for Gene Pitney.. He scored his first UK number one in 1957 with Michael Holliday's sweet-but-charming The Story of My Life - a song that was originally recorded by Marty Robbins in the US.. That song also happened to be his first collaboration with Hal David, with whom he forged one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the '60s.. Their sophisticated, debonair pop was often at odds with the more raucous sounds of rock 'n' roll, but the hits kept coming - especially when they teamed up with Dionne Warwick. . Over a period of 10 years, the trio enjoyed 39 consecutive US hits, including such memorable songs as Walk On By, Don't Make Me Over, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and Promises, Promises.. Warwick later sued Bacharach after he and David stopped working together, leaving her without new material to record. . It was a \"very costly and unfortunate\" dispute, Bacharach told the Guardian in 2019, adding: \"I stupidly handled it wrong.\". He and Warwick reconciled for the 1985 charity single That's What Friends Are For, which raised $1.5m for the American Foundation for Aids Research (AmFar) - and also featured vocals from Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight.. Outside of that partnership, Bacharach and David won a Grammy and an Oscar in 1969 for Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, performed by BJ Thomas and featured in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.. Bacharach's music for the film also won the Oscar for best original score.. Although his hits tailed off in later years, Bacharach remained a popular figure, collaborating with Adele, Sheryl Crow and Dr Dre, among others.. Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher was a huge admirer, and once admitted to lifting the chords for Half The World Away from Bacharach's This Guy's In Love With You.. \"It sounds exactly the same. I'm surprised he's not sued me yet.\". Bacharach made a memorable appearance in the second Austin Powers film, performing I'll Never Fall in Love Again on an open top bus with Elvis Costello.. In 2016, he also wrote the score for John Asher's indie drama Po, saying he identified with the story, which explores the impact of autism on children. . Bacharach's daughter Nikki had died of suicide in 2007, at the age of 40, after a lifelong struggle with Asperger's syndrome.   . The musician was married four times, to Paula Stewart in 1953, actress Angie Dickinson in 1958, his frequent musical collaborator Carole Bayer Sager in 1982, and finally Jane Hansen in 1993.. He is survived by Hansen and their children Oliver and Raleigh, as well as son Cristopher from his marriage to Bayer Sager.. ",
