        "content": "Watch: Imran Khan's chaotic court summons in 60 seconds. Police said Mr Khan's backers threw stones and fired tear gas near the High Court in Islamabad.. The former cricketer-turned-politician has since set off back to his home in Lahore, which police raided in his absence and made arrests.. He denies the charges against him.. The chaotic scenes saw Mr Khan unable to enter the court before the judge agreed that he could mark his attendance and return home.. The ex-PM says the charges against him are politically motivated but says he is attending court \"because I believe in the rule of law\". The government says the charges against him have nothing to do with politics.. He told Reuters that he had formed a committee to lead his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), in the event of his arrest.. About 4,000 security officials, including elite commandos and anti-terrorism squads, have been deployed in Islamabad, AFP reported.. Police blocked the highway into Islamabad with shipping containers and large trucks to stop Mr Khan's convoy as it approached the city. . Officers armed with sticks and tear gas cannisters let his vehicle through, but most of his supporters were turned away.. Speaking to the BBC when the convoy was stationary, Mr Khan said that the authorities were trying to put him in prison to keep him out of the general election race later this year. \"I won't be able to campaign - that's the whole thing,\" he said.. Earlier this week he told the BBC: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". In a sign of the deep divisions within Pakistani politics, the current Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted that Mr Khan's \"antics of the last few days\" had \"laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies\" and accused him of using supporters as \"human shields\".. Earlier in the week Lahore police tried to arrest Mr Khan after he missed a hearing, and officers clashed with supporters outside his home. On Friday, the court granted Mr Khan protection against arrest on the assurance that he would appear in court on Saturday. . On Saturday Lahore police used a digger to gain entry to Mr Khan's residence in an operation involving nearly 1,000 security personnel, according to local media. Police later said they had arrested Khan supporters who had been involved in violence against police earlier in the week, including for throwing petrol bombs.. The Punjab police chief said some officers would remain outside Mr Khan's residence.. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister last April in a no-confidence vote but has kept up pressure on his successor Mr Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He blames Mr Sharif for an assassination attempt at a rally in November in which he was wounded in the leg. Authorities have rejected the accusation.. Mr Khan faces multiple court cases, including terrorism charges. He has cited a variety of reasons - including security concerns and injury from the assassination attempt in November - for not showing up to hearings. . ",

        "content": "The claims focus on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow's invasion in 2022.. Moscow has denied the allegations and denounced the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move, as the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects without the co-operation of a country's government. . Russia is not an ICC member country, meaning the court, located in The Hague, has no authority there. . However, it could affect Mr Putin in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally. He could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states. . Mr Putin is only the third president to be issued with an ICC arrest warrant.. President Biden said that, while the court also held no sway in the US, the issuing of the warrant \"makes a very strong point\".. \"He's clearly committed war crimes,\" he told reporters.. His administration had earlier \".  during the conflict in Ukraine, with Vice-President Kamala Harris saying in February that those involved would \"be held to account\". .  earlier this week that found Moscow's forced removal of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounted to a war crime. . In a statement on Friday, the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said the warrants were \"based upon forensic evidence, scrutiny and what's been said by those two individuals\".. The court had initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public to try and stop further crimes being committed.. \"Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported,\" Mr Khan told the BBC. . \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be a human being to know how egregious it is.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. Mr Khan also pointed out that nobody thought that Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, would end up in The Hague to face justice. . \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" Mr Khan said.. Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, who led the prosecution in the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said the warrant would change how foreign leaders view Mr Putin.  . \"He will remain an alleged criminal until and unless he submits himself for trial, or is handed over for trial and acquitted. That seems extremely unlikely, so he will remain an alleged criminal until the end of his life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. Russian opposition activists have welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his thanks to Mr Khan and the ICC for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. ",
