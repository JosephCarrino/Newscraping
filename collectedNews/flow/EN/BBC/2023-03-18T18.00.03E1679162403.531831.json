        "content": "Watch: Imran Khan's chaotic court summons in 60 seconds. Police said Mr Khan's backers threw stones and fired tear gas near the court complex.. The former cricketer-turned-politician has since set off back to his home in Lahore, which police raided in his absence and made arrests.. He denies the charges against him.. The chaotic scenes saw Mr Khan unable to enter the court before the judge agreed that he could mark his attendance and return home.. The ex-PM says the charges against him are politically motivated but says he is attending court \"because I believe in the rule of law\". The government says the charges against him have nothing to do with politics.. He told Reuters that he had formed a committee to lead his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), in the event of his arrest.. About 4,000 security officials, including elite commandos and anti-terrorism squads, have been deployed in Islamabad, AFP reported.. Police blocked the highway into Islamabad with shipping containers and large trucks to stop Mr Khan's convoy as it approached the city. . Officers armed with sticks and tear gas cannisters let his vehicle through, but most of his supporters were turned away.. Speaking to the BBC when the convoy was stationary, Mr Khan said that the authorities were trying to put him in prison to keep him out of the general election race later this year. \"I won't be able to campaign - that's the whole thing,\" he said.. Earlier this week he told the BBC: \"Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning.\". In a sign of the deep divisions within Pakistani politics, the current Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif tweeted that Mr Khan's \"antics of the last few days\" had \"laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies\" and accused him of using supporters as \"human shields\".. Earlier in the week Lahore police tried to arrest Mr Khan after he missed a hearing, and officers clashed with supporters outside his home. On Friday, the court granted Mr Khan protection against arrest on the assurance that he would appear in court on Saturday. . On Saturday Lahore police used a digger to gain entry to Mr Khan's residence in an operation involving nearly 1,000 security personnel, according to local media. Police later said they had arrested Khan supporters who had been involved in violence against police earlier in the week, including for throwing petrol bombs.. The Punjab police chief said some officers would remain outside Mr Khan's residence.. Mr Khan was ousted as prime minister last April in a no-confidence vote but has kept up pressure on his successor Mr Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.. He blames Mr Sharif for an assassination attempt at a rally in November in which he was wounded in the leg. Authorities have rejected the accusation.. Mr Khan faces multiple court cases, including terrorism charges. He has cited a variety of reasons - including security concerns and injury from the assassination attempt in November - for not showing up to hearings. . ",

        "content": "Watch: The river filled with dead fish. The large-scale fish deaths were first reported on Friday morning in the New South Wales' (NSW) town of Menindee.. The state's river authority said it was a result of an ongoing heatwave affecting the Darling-Baaka river.. Locals say it is the largest fish death event to hit the town, that experienced another significant mass death of fish just three years ago..  the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) said the heatwave put \"further stress on a system that has experienced extreme conditions from wide-scale flooding\".. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.. Speaking to the BBC, Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb described the deaths as \"surreal\". . \"It'll probably be a bit more confronting today,\" he said, as he warned that locals were anticipating that even more fish would die as the already decomposing fish sucked more oxygen from the water. . Around 500 people live in the town in far-west New South Wales. The Darling-Baaka river is a part of the Murray Darling Basin, Australia's largest river system.. The NSW DPI also said that the fish deaths were \"distressing to the local community\", a sentiment echoed by Mr McCrabb.. \"You can just imagine leaving a fish in your kitchen to rot with all the doors shut and no air conditioner, and we've got millions of them.\". The temperature in Menindee was expected to reach 41C on Saturday.. He added that locals in the regional town rely on the Darling-Baaka for water supplies, \"we use the river water for washing and showering in so people won't be able to use that water for those basic needs again,\" he said.. \"Over time those people won't be able to access that water for domestic use which is just shameful\".. This week's fish deaths throws a light on the troubles facing the Murray Darling Basin. Drought and increased human use has impacted the health of the Murray Darling ecosystem. . The Murray Darling Basin authority said agriculture, industries and communities have used water from the river system which has resulted in less water flowing through the river.. It also said the Basin is prone to extreme weather events and has a highly variable climate that makes it vulnerable to both fires and droughts. . In 2012, a plan worth A$13bn (£8.45bn at the time) was implemented to try and stop the river from drying up and returning it to a healthier level.. The NSW DPI said it will work with federal agencies to respond to the latest incident, and to find the underlying causes of the deaths. . ",

        "content": "Prosecutors have been looking at a possible indictment of Mr Trump. Reports say it could come next week.. If he is indicted, it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.. For five years, prosecutors in New York have been investigating allegations that hush money was paid on Mr Trump's behalf to former porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.. Ms Daniels says she was paid $130,000 (£107,000) by Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen before the 2016 election, in exchange for silence about an alleged affair. Mr Trump denies they had sexual relations and has dismissed the case as being politically motivated.. It is one of several cases in which the 76-year-old is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.. Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted. . Past efforts to investigate him, including two impeachment trials, the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago raid, have tended to make him more popular with his base, so an indictment could have a similar effect.. It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged this week or even, beyond broad strokes, what those charges might be. . But with the former president predicting an arrest, and calling for mass protests, this is a journey into unknown territory.. Mr Trump has a loyal base of followers, and the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters following his repeated calls to protest has proven that a fraught situation can quickly escalate into violence.. On Saturday Mr Trump wrote on his social networking site Truth Social that \"illegal leaks\" from the Manhattan district attorney's office \"indicate\" he would be arrested on Tuesday. . The district attorney's office has not yet commented. Mr Trump's lawyer, Susan Necheles, said her team had not heard anything from law enforcement officials.. \"Since this is a political prosecution, the district attorney's office has engaged in a practice of leaking everything to the press, rather than communicating with President Trump's attorneys as would be done in a normal case,\" she said. . The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, has hit out at the investigation, calling it \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA [district attorney]\". . In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections \"with politically motivated prosecutions\".. Any indictment would create a complicated calculation for Mr Trump's rivals within the Republican Party, as they decide whether to up their attacks on the former president while he is potentially distracted or keep their heads down and hope for the best. . If history is any guide, it will be the latter.. The Stormy Daniels case progressed earlier this month when Mr Trump was invited to testify to a grand jury, which experts said indicated he could soon face criminal charges.. The hearings are held in secret and several former aides of Mr Trump have reportedly testified in this case.  . US media organisations say law enforcement agencies in New York are preparing for the possibility of Mr Trump being indicted and appearing in a Manhattan courtroom as early as next week.. According to the Associated Press, they are considering the practicalities of taking a former president into court, including questions around security. . Another lawyer for Mr Trump, Joseph Tacopina, told the news agency \"we will follow the normal procedures\" if he is indicted.. Donald Trump faces a separate criminal investigation over efforts to overturn his narrow loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election - though it is not known if the former president is being directly investigated. . The Department of Justice is also looking at whether classified government documents were handled incorrectly after Mr Trump left office, as well as broader efforts to undermine the results of the presidential election three years ago - including the 6 January attack..

        "content": "The claims focus on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia since Moscow's invasion in 2022.. Moscow has denied the allegations and denounced the warrants as \"outrageous\".. It is highly unlikely that much will come of the move, as the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects without the co-operation of a country's government. . Russia is not an ICC member country, meaning the court, located in The Hague, has no authority there. . However, it could affect Mr Putin in other ways, such as being unable to travel internationally. He could now be arrested if he sets foot in any of the court's 123 member states. . Mr Putin is only the third president to be issued with an ICC arrest warrant.. President Biden said that, while the court also held no sway in the US, the issuing of the warrant \"makes a very strong point\".. \"He's clearly committed war crimes,\" he told reporters.. His administration had earlier \".  during the conflict in Ukraine, with Vice-President Kamala Harris saying in February that those involved would \"be held to account\". .  earlier this week that found Moscow's forced removal of Ukrainian children to areas under its control amounted to a war crime. . In a statement on Friday, the ICC said it had reasonable grounds to believe Mr Putin committed the criminal acts directly, as well as working with others. It also accused him of failing to use his presidential powers to stop children being deported.. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes.. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said the warrants were \"based upon forensic evidence, scrutiny and what's been said by those two individuals\".. The court had initially considered keeping the arrest warrants a secret, but decided to make them public to try and stop further crimes being committed.. \"Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported,\" Mr Khan told the BBC. . \"This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be a human being to know how egregious it is.\". This video can not be played. WATCH: Can Vladimir Putin actually be arrested?. Mr Khan also pointed out that nobody thought that Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who went on trial for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, would end up in The Hague to face justice. . \"Those that feel that you can commit a crime in the daytime, and sleep well at night, should perhaps look at history,\" Mr Khan said.. Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, who led the prosecution in the trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said the warrant would change how foreign leaders view Mr Putin.  . \"He will remain an alleged criminal until and unless he submits himself for trial, or is handed over for trial and acquitted. That seems extremely unlikely, so he will remain an alleged criminal until the end of his life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were \"null and void\" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.. Russian opposition activists have welcomed the announcement. Ivan Zhdanov, a close ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has tweeted that it was \"a symbolic step\" but an important one.. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his thanks to Mr Khan and the ICC for their decision to press charges against \"state evil\".. ",
