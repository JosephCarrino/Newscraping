        "content": "The discovery was made by a farmer digging his land in Khan Younis, in the south of the strip.. On social media, some Gazans are making wry comments suggesting the goddess's association with war seems apt.. In recent years, they have seen a series of devastating flare-ups in the conflict between Israel and militant groups in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.  . However, the discovery of this limestone statue is a reminder of how the strip - part of an important trade route for successive ancient civilisations - was originally a Canaanite settlement.. The 22cm-high (8.7 in) carving clearly shows the face of the goddess wearing a serpent crown.. \"We found it by chance. It was muddy and we washed it with water,\" said farmer Nidal Abu Eid, who came across the head while cultivating his field.  . \"We realised that it was a precious thing, but we didn't know it was of such great archaeological value,\" he told the BBC.. \"We thank God, and we are proud that it stayed in our land, in Palestine, since the Canaanite times.\" . The statue of Anat - one of the best-known Canaanite deities - is now on display in Qasr al-Basha, a historic building that serves as one of Gaza's few museums. . Unveiling the artefact at a press conference on Tuesday, Jamal Abu Rida of the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said the statue was \"resistant against time\" and had been carefully examined by experts.. He said that it made a political point.. \"Such discoveries prove that Palestine has civilisation and history, and no-one can deny or falsify this history,\" he said. \"This is the Palestinian people and their ancient Canaanite civilisation.\". Not all archaeological finds in Gaza have been so highly appreciated or fared so well.  . Hamas - an Islamist, militant organisation - has previously been accused of destroying the remains of a large, fortified Canaanite town, Tell al-Sakan, to make way for housing and military bases south of highly populated Gaza City.. , but later disappeared mysteriously.. However, this year Hamas reopened the remains of a 5th Century Byzantine church after foreign donors helped pay for a years-long restoration project.. Work also stopped at a building site in northern Gaza when 31 Roman-era tombs were found there.. While such ancient sites could potentially be a draw for foreign visitors, it has virtually no tourism industry. . Israel and Egypt tightly restrict the flow of people in and out of the impoverished coastal enclave, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians, citing security concerns. .

        "content": "The increase in prices \"is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects\", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC.. He said \"households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis\". . \"We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,\" the senior economist at the World Bank added. . Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. . The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year.. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen \"the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike\", when .  sent prices soaring.. Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. . Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said \"disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect\" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. . Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving to . . That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere.. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at their .  60 years ago.. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically.. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. . Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall.. \"Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,\" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season.. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, \"equate to about 10 days of world food supply\". . This video can not be played. The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. . As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: \"We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years\".. Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means \"there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline\". . For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: \"While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast.\". It added that \"the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine\" and the disruption it causes to supply chains..
