        "content": "Watch: Wave of Russian strikes leaves destruction across Ukraine. Russia had reportedly not fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles - which can evade air defences - since the early months of the conflict.. The latest barrage was the most severe to hit Ukraine for weeks.. It cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's biggest - although it was later restored.. On Thursday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: \"High-precision long-range air, sea and land-based weapons, including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system, hit key elements of Ukraine's military infrastructure.\". It was the biggest day of Russian strikes on Ukraine since the end of January,. The Ukrainian military claimed it had successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four Iranian-made Shahed drones.. But it also said it had been unable to intercept the six Kinzhal ballistic missiles - nor was it able to destroy older weapons, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.. \"This was a major attack and for the first time with so many different types of missiles,\" the Reuters news agency quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson as saying. \"It was like never before.\". President Vladimir Putin has highlighted Russia's investment in ballistic hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound.. The attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west, with power blackouts reported in several areas. . Nuclear energy operator Energoatom said the strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant had cut off the link between the facility and the Ukrainian power system. . For the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility operated on diesel generators until the link was restored later on Thursday.. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.. \"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.. In the capital Kyiv, emergency services attended the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.. A missile also hit an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported.. Elsewhere, Ukraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.. Moscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.. \"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\". Between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.. ",

        "content": "Violence has since decreased sharply, but prominent pro-Taliban figures and others have been killed in a string of attacks, many claimed by Islamic State.. Local police said the cause of the latest blast was unclear. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.. But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter that the governor had been \"martyred in an explosion by the enemies of Islam\". An investigation is under way, he added.. Muzammil is reported to have led the fight against Islamic State militants in his previous posting as governor of the eastern province of Nangarhar. He was moved to Balkh last October.. Balkh police spokesperson Mohammed Asif Waziri said the explosion occurred \"around 9am... inside the second floor of the governor's office\". . Police said at least one other person also died in the attack. A number of others are reported to have been injured.. \"There was a bang. I fell on the ground,\" Khairuddin, who was wounded in the blast, told AFP news agency. He said he had seen a friend lose a hand in the explosion.. The explosion occurred just after the governor arrived in his office, he said.. Unconfirmed reports say it was a suicide attack.. A day earlier provincial Taliban authorities claimed they had killed eight \"rebels and kidnappers\" in Mazar-e Sharif, the Balkh capital. They did not, however, specify which \"rebel\" group these individuals were allegedly affiliated to.. The Taliban were ousted as Afghanistan's rulers in 2001 - the militant Islamist group swept back to power in August 2021 after US-led forces pulled out..  since then has mainly targeted mosques and minority communities, many claimed by . , who are bitter rivals of the Taliban..

        "content": "The weeks-old protests are some of the biggest Israel has ever seen.. Critics say the reforms will undermine democracy; the government says planned changes are better for the electorate.. Thousands of protesters, many waving Israeli flags and carrying signs with slogans against the reforms, massed on main roads in Tel Aviv, causing major disruption to traffic.. A line of police on horseback stood by as the demonstrators flowed past, with some chanting to the police: \"We're also here for you,\" Haaretz newspaper reported.. Meanwhile convoys of cars streamed towards the airport from early morning, causing gridlock at the entrance to try to block Mr Netanyahu from getting there by road. He flew in by helicopter instead.. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin landed at the airport on Thursday and was reportedly forced to alter his schedule because of the protests. . In talks with his Israeli counterpart, Mr Austin expressed concern about escalating violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It came hours after three Palestinian militants were killed in a gun-battle with Israeli forces in the town of Jaba. . Israel said the militants had opened fire as an undercover unit carried out an arrest raid. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, said the three had been \"executed\".. Elsewhere in the demonstrations in Israel, students blocked one of the main entrances to the northern port city of Haifa, while in Jerusalem hundreds of military reservists demonstrated outside the offices of a pro-reform right-wing think tank.. Some blocked the entrance to the office with sandbags and seven reservists were arrested, local media reported.. In Israel, military service is compulsory, and most men are required to do reserve duty every year afterwards, mostly up until the age of 40.. The protests against the judicial reforms have been going on for about 10 weeks, bringing at times hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets.. The issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society, and significantly has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.. On Monday, in an unprecedented move, . . They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.. Mr Netanyahu's government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.. Critics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.. Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts over-reaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.. ",

        "content": "Ukraine's SBU security service said the claims were a provocation by Moscow.. Transnistria is a small sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine which is dependent on Russia.. Since 1992 it has hosted a contingent of around 1,700 Russian peacekeepers. Moscow has warned that any threat to the entity's security would be an attack on Russia itself.. Moldova itself has a pro-Western government but fears Russia is plotting a coup, and last month Ukrainian officials accused Russia of \"psy-ops\" after Moscow accused it of plotting an invasion of Transnistria. . Authorities in the Transnistrian capital Tiraspol quoted by the Reuters news agency said that the suspects were operating \"under the direct control and instructions of representatives of the security service of Ukraine (SBU) to carry out the murder of officials\".. They said the pair most likely intended to detonate a Land Rover full of explosives in central Tiraspol to cause maximum casualties, and that they were targeting officials and their families.. The SBU denied that there was any planned attack.. \"Any statements by representatives... of the fake 'People's Republic of Transnistria' regarding the participation of the SBU in the preparation of a terrorist attack should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin,\" the agency said in a statement.. Moldovan officials said they were investigating any claims and were ready to respond to any security threats.. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.. Last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine, bringing it one step closer to joining the bloc. . But it has faced a major energy crisis because of its outdated power infrastructure and problems with gas supplies from Russia.. Rampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by pro-Russian groups. . The country's pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova's leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. . The Kremlin has accused Moldova's leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.. Dominated by Russian speakers, Transnistria proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by the Russian troops stationed there.. As long as Transnistria's future remains unclear, tensions will remain. Moldova's new prime minister has made demilitarising the area as a priority and the foreign ministry has said it will continue to seek a peaceful solution.. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointedly revoked a 2012 decree committing Russia to finding a solution for Transnistria based on respect for Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity..
